''\nThis was the last radio contact with the flight .\nAt 10:30:08 , the captain told the co-pilot that he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications , which the co-pilot acknowledged .\nAt 10:30:53 , the selected altitude on the Flight Control Unit ( FCU ) changed in from 38,000 ft to 100 ft. One second later , the autopilot changed to OPEN DES mode and autothrust changed to THR IDLE mode .\nThe airplane started to descend and both engines ' speed decreased .\nAt 10:33:12 , the speed management changed from managed mode to selected mode .\nOne second later , the selected target speed became 308 kt while the aeroplane 's speed was 273 kt .\nThe aeroplane 's speed started to increase along with the descent rate , which subsequently varied between 1,700 ft/min and 5,000 ft/min , then was on average about 3,500 ft/min .\nThe selected speed decreased to 288 kt .\nThen , over the following 13 seconds , the value of this target speed changed six times until it reached 302 kt .\nAt 10:33:47 , the controller asked the flight crew what cruise level they were cleared for .\nThe airplane was then at an altitude of 30,000 ft in descent .\nThere was no answer from the co-pilot .\nOver the following 30 seconds , the controller tried to contact the flight crew again on two occasions , without any answer .\nThereafter the selected speed increased up to 323 kt .\nThen the buzzer to request access to the cockpit sounded , but the copilot did not react .\nMarseille control centre kept attempting to contact the flight , without any response .\nThe selected speed was again increased , this time to 350 kt .\nMeanwhile the captain attempted to call the copilot over the interphone and there were noises similar to a person knocking on the cockpit door .\nAt the same time Marseille control and a controller from the French Air Defence system called the flight at various frequencies , without success .\nAs the aircraft kept descending noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions between 10:39:30 and 10:40:28 .\nThe GPWS then sounded : `` Terrain , Terrain , Pull Up , Pull Up '' until the aircraft impacted a sloping rocky ravine in mountainous terrain at an elevation of 1550 meters .\nProbable Cause : Causes : The collision with the ground was due to the deliberate and planned action of the co-pilot who decided to commit suicide while alone in the cockpit .\nThe process for medical certification of pilots , in particular self-reporting in case of decrease in medical fitness between two periodic medical evaluations , did not succeed in preventing the co-pilot , who was experiencing mental disorder with psychotic symptoms , from exercising the privilege of his licence .\nThe following factors may have contributed to the failure of this principle : - the co-pilot 's probable fear of losing his ability to fly as a professional pilot if he had reported his decrease in medical fitness to an AME ; - the potential financial consequences generated by the lack of specific insurance covering the risks of loss of income in case of unfitness to fly ; - the lack of clear guidelines in German regulations on when a threat to public safety outweighs the requirements of medical confidentiality .\nSecurity requirements led to cockpit doors designed to resist forcible intrusion by unauthorized persons .\nThis made it impossible to enter the flight compartment before the aircraft impacted the terrain in the French Alps .\nAccident investigation : Investigating agency : BEA Status : Investigation completed Duration : 1 years Accident number : BEA2015-0125 Download report : Final report Language :

primarily calling for better checks on crew members .\nOn 6 May 2015 , EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc asked the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) to set up a task force to look into the findings set out in the preliminary BEA report .\nThe Task Force consisted of 14 senior representatives from airlines , flight crew associations , medical advisors and authorities.On July 17 , 2015 , the Task Force published their report , which contained six recommendations for the European Commission , primarily calling for better checks on crew members .\nBEA issued 10 Safety Recommendations EASA issued 2 EASA Safety Information Bulletins Issued : 27-MAR-2015 To : Commercial air transport ( CAT ) operators EASA SIB 2015-04 The Agency recommends operators to re-assess the safety and security risks associated with flight crew members leaving the flight crew compartment due to operational or physiological needs during non-critical phases of flight .\nBased on this assessment , operators are recommended to implement procedures requiring at least two persons authorised in accordance with CAT.GEN.MPA.135 to be in the flight crew compartment at all times , or other equivalent mitigating measures to address risks identified by the operator\u0092s revised assessment .\n( Withdrawn ) Issued : 13-MAR-2016 To : EASA Recommendation FRAN-2016-011 EASA require that when a class 1 medical certificate is issued to an applicant with a history of psychological/psychiatric trouble of any sort , conditions for the follow-up of his/her fitness to fly be defined .\nThis may include restrictions on the duration of the certificate or other operational limitations and the need for a specific psychiatric evaluation for subsequent revalidations or renewals .\nIssued : 13-MAR-2016 To : EASA Recommendation FRAN-2016-012 EASA include in the European Plan for Aviation Safety an action for the EU Member States to perform a routine analysis of in-flight incapacitation , with particular reference but not limited to psychological or psychiatric issues , to help with continuous re-evaluation of the medical assessment criteria , to improve the expression of risk of in-flight incapacitation in numerical terms and to encourage data collection to validate the effectiveness of these criteria .\nIssued : 13-MAR-2016 To : EASA Recommendation FRAN-2016-013 EASA , in coordination with the Network of Analysts , perform routine analysis of in-flight incapacitation , with particular reference but not limited to psychological or psychiatric issues , to help with continuous re-evaluation of the medical assessment criteria , to improve the expression of risk of in-flight incapacitation in numerical terms and to encourage data collection to validate the effectiveness of these criteria .\nIssued : 13-MAR-2016 To : EASA Recommendation FRAN-2016-014 EASA ensure that European operators include in their Management Systems measures to mitigate socio-economic risks related to a loss of licence by one of their pilots for medical reasons .\nIssued : 13-MAR-2016 To : IATA Recommendation FRAN-2016-015 IATA encourage its Member Airlines to implement measures to mitigate the socio-economic risks related to pilots\u0092 loss of licence for medical reasons .\nIssued : 13-MAR-2016 To : EASA Recommendation FRAN-2016-016 EASA define the modalities under which EU regulations would allow pilots to be declared fit to fly while taking anti-depressant medication under medical supervision .\nIssued : 13-MAR-2016 To : WHO Recommendation FRAN-2016-017 The World Health Organization develop guidelines for its Member States in order to help them define clear rules to require health care providers to inform the appropriate authorities when a specific patient\u0092s health is very likely to impact public safety , including when the patient refuses to consent , without legal risk to the health care provider , while still protecting patients\u0092 private data from unnecessary disclosure .\nIssued : 13-MAR-2016 To : EC Recommendation FRAN-2016-018 The European Commission in coordination with EU Member States define clear rules to require health care providers to inform the appropriate authorities when a specific patient\u0092s health is very likely to impact public safety , including when the patient refuses to consent , without legal risk to the health care provider , while still protecting patients\u0092 private data from unnecessary disclosure .\nThese rules should take into account the specificities of pilots , for whom the risk of losing their medical certificate , being not only a financial matter but also a matter related to their passion for flying , may deter them from seeking appropriate health care .\nIssued : 13-MAR-2016 To : BMVI ; Bundes\u00e4rztekammer Recommendation FRAN-2016-019/-20 Without waiting for action at EU level , the BMVI and the Bundes\u00e4rztekammer ( B\u00c4K ) edit guidelines for all German health care providers to : - remind them of the possibility of breaching medical confidentiality and reporting to the LBA or another appropriate authority if the health of a commercial pilot presents a potential public safety risk .\n- define what can be considered as `` imminent danger '' and `` threat to public safety '' when dealing with pilots\u0092 health issues - limit the legal consequence for health care providers breaching medical confidentiality in good faith to lessen or prevent a threat to public safety Issued : 13-MAR-2016 To : EASA Recommendation FRAN-2016-021 EASA ensure that European operators promote the implementation of peer support groups to provide a process for pilots , their families and peers to report and discuss personal and mental health issues , with the assurance that information will be kept in-confidence in a just-culture work environment , and that pilots will be supported as well as guided with the aim of providing them with help , ensuring flight safety and allowing them to return to flying duties , where applicable .\nIssued : 21-JUL-2016 To : Commercial air transport ( CAT ) operators EASA SIB 2016-09 CAT.OP.MPA.210 of Regulation ( EU ) No 965/2012 stipulates that flight crew members required to be on duty in the flight crew compartment shall remain at the assigned station , unless absence is necessary for the performance of duties in connection with the operations or for physiological needs , provided at least one suitably qualified pilot remains at the controls of the aircraft at all times .\nIn such cases , the Agency recommends operators to assess the safety and security risks associated with a flight crew member remaining alone in the flight crew compartment .\nIf the assessment leads the operator to require two authorised persons in accordance with CAT.GEN.MPA.135 to be in the flight crew compartment at all times , operators should ensure that : ( a ) the role of the authorised person , other than the operating pilot , in the flight crew compartment is clearly defined , considering that his/her main task should be to open the secure door when the flight crew member who left the compartment returns ; ( b ) only suitably qualified flight crew members are allowed to sit at the controls ; ( c ) safety and security procedures are established for his/her presence in the flight crew compartment ( e.g .\noperation of the flight deck , specific procedure for entry , use of observer seat and oxygen masks , avoidance of distractions etc .\n) ; ( d ) training needs are addressed and identified as appropriate ; ( e ) safety risks stemming from the authorised person leaving the passenger cabin are assessed and mitigated , if necessary ; and ( f ) resulting procedures are detailed in the Operations Manual and , when relevant , the related security reference documents .\nShow all ...

Andropov , the 67-year-old head of the State Security Committee , whose positioning relative to Mr. Brezhnev would have put him ninth in the hierarchy , after Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko , who is generally not considered to be a contender for power .\nMr. Andropov 's stature appeared to have been enhanced by the Lenin birthday rally , at which he made the keynote speech .\nAlthough the task has rotated among Politburo members , the fact that he was designated this year , and made a tough ideological address , was taken as a sign that he is bidding for the post of top party ideologist , vacant since Mikhail A.

{"label": false, "txt": "Arnold Schwarzenegger 's last act as governor follows himStory highlights Father of slain son : `` ( Schwarzenegger ) plays a hero in the movies , yet in real life he 's not a hero .\nHe 's a dirty politician . ''\nHe commuted the sentence of Esteban Nunez , the teen who pleaded guilty to stabbing Luis Santos to death in 2008 Esteban is the son of Fabian Nunez , California 's most powerful Democrat and a political ally CNN \u2014 In Hollywood , there \u2019 s no better magnet for stargazing than a movie premiere .\nSo on a Sunday afternoon in late June , the summer sun couldn \u2019 t keep thousands of fans from lining Hollywood Boulevard , hoping to spot a star .\nThis was the \u201c Terminator Genisys \u201d premiere , and only one star mattered : Arnold Schwarzenegger .\nThe former governor of California shook hands , signed autographs and posed for selfies .\nIt \u2019 s the kind of personal attention Fred and Kathy Santos wish they could get from Schwarzenegger , who they say stole justice from their dead son .\n\u201c He plays a hero in the movies , yet in real life he \u2019 s not a hero , \u201d Fred Santos said .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a dirty politician. \u201d Minutes before ending his two terms as governor , Schwarzenegger issued his final act : Commuting the sentence of Esteban Nunez , the teen who pleaded guilty to stabbing to death the Santos \u2019 son , Luis , in 2008 .\nIt \u2019 s not that a governor issuing clemency was anything new .\nBut neither the Santos family nor San Diego County prosecutors had any idea it was coming , let alone got a chance to plead their case .\nInstead , they were informed by a news release and a phone call from a reporter .\n\u201c My son ( was ) stabbed in the heart when he was alive , \u201d Fred Santos told CNN .\n\u201c Schwarzenegger stabbed him in the back after my son is killed. \u201d At first , Fred Santos asked himself why the governor would care about their case .\nBut deep down he knew .\nSantos feared political influence from the beginning \u2013 ever since learning that Esteban Nunez wasn \u2019 t just any accused killer .\nHe was the son of Fabian Nunez , California \u2019 s most powerful Democrat and a political ally to the governor .\nSo to many , such as San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis , Schwarzenegger \u2019 s surprise commutation appeared as if Nunez was cashing in .\n\u201c I think it was political cronyism at its worst. \u201d The speaker \u2019 s son , a brutal crime When Fabian Nunez was sworn in as speaker of the California Assembly in 2004 , his son was by his side .\nAt 15 , Esteban Nunez appeared baby-faced and shy \u2013 nothing like the muscular , tattooed adult described in court records just four years later .\nIt was October 2008 , and prosecutors alleged that Esteban Nunez and Ryan Jett were fueling their anger with alcohol .\nThey had just been denied entry to a fraternity party near the campus of San Diego State University ( neither were students there ) , and they were looking for revenge .\nThe Sacramento natives were going to show them how it was done \u201c in Sac town , \u201d the pair boasted , according to court records .\n\u201c They decided they were going to either burn a frat house or they were going to stab some people , \u201d Dumanis said .\nArmed with knives , they walked the streets at 2 a.m. until they encountered Luis Santos and a friend .\nAfter an initial altercation , Luis called several more friends who ran to his aid .\n\u201c It was a melee basically , where two of the boys were stabbed .\nOne went into an induced coma , \u201d Dumanis said .\n\u201c Luis was stabbed , and one got smashed in the eye. \u201d \u201c My boy \u2019 s dying , my boy \u2019 s dying , \u201d Luis \u2019 friend screamed to a 911 dispatcher .\n\u201c Stay awake Luis , stay awake , \u201d another friend sobbed .\nA knife pierced the left ventricle of Luis \u2019 heart .\nHe died at the scene .\nLater that same night , Nunez , Jett and two others piled into a car and headed north to Sacramento .\nSurveillance video at a 7-Eleven captured Jett and Nunez leaving the store with a Big Gulp cup .\nThey filled it with $ 1.30 worth of gasoline and used it to burn their weapons and bloody clothes , throwing the items into the Sacramento River and agreeing to never speak of the incident .\nBut witnesses helped police identify four suspects , and two of them weren \u2019 t so quiet .\nThe pair fingered Nunez and Jett as the stabbers , later getting probation in exchange for their testimony .\nTwo months after getting a phone call that their son was dead , the phone rang again at the home of Fred and Kathy Santos .\nTheir son \u2019 s alleged killers were behind bars , and a reporter had a question : What was their reaction to the son of Fabian Nunez being arrested for Luis \u2019 murder ?\n\u201c My concern was that politics might interfere with justice in the legal system , \u201d Fred Santos told CNN .\nThough assured the system would not bend to politics , Santos says he grew up in Asia , where \u201c politicians are dirty. \u201d \u201c I asked if the judge was a Democrat , \u201d he said , believing Fabian Nunez \u2019 s power in that party would influence the case .\nThe judge was a Republican .\nIn time , however , the judge would become the least of Santos \u2019 worries .\nFoes to friends By the time Esteban Nunez was charged with murder , his father had already derailed Arnold Schwarzenegger \u2019 s early years in office .\nThe Republican governor tried to bypass Nunez and the Democrats by calling for too many special elections on pet projects , with failing results .\n\u201c I got to tell you , things are very sloppy here on the first floor , \u201d Nunez once told reporters , referring to the governor \u2019 s office .\nSchwarzenegger returned the jab in private conversations that were recorded and later released to news organizations .\n\u201c Fabian is too much a political operator , \u201d he told his staff , apparently unaware of the recording .\n\u201c Not so much passion about specific things he stands for. \u201d But with his policies stalling in Sacramento , Schwarzenegger announced a shift in strategy in a State of the State address , conceding his mistakes and pledging to work with Nunez and the Democrats .\nThe tactic proved beneficial for both sides .\nThe pair stood side-by-side when California passed legislation creating the highest minimum wage in the nation , one of many victories out of a newly minted political friendship .\nIn 2008 , though , Schwarzenegger did not publicly get involved in Nunez \u2019 s personal problems .\nInstead , with his son facing a first degree murder charge and fighting for a lower bail amount , Fabian Nunez called on his Democratic friends to vouch for the credibility of his son .\nA union leader , a retired assemblyman and even then-Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa submitted letters to the judge .\nOn official mayoral stationery , Villaraigosa wrote that Esteban had shared meals at his home and that he was \u201c a young man of good and upright character. \u201d \u201c They already have the mayor trying to influence the judge , \u201d Fred Santos said .\n\u201c Nobody in power was speaking ( for us ) .\nWe \u2019 re just regular folks. \u201d The deal In 2010 , Esteban Nunez and Ryan Jett were moments away from their murder trial .\nA first degree conviction would result in a sentence of 25 years to life in prison .\nA second degree conviction , 15 to life .\nBut then , with jury selection already underway , came the next twist in this case : a plea deal for Nunez and Jett .\nIf the pair pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter , they would face a maximum of 16 years behind bars .\nFor the Santos family it sounded too brief , but would offer swift justice and an end to years of future pain .\n\u201c So we will not be spending the rest of our lives going to court \u2026 listening to them fight their appeal if they were convicted , \u201d Fred Santos said .\nFor District Attorney Dumanis , a plea bargain also removed , in her mind , the only impediment to an otherwise airtight case : proving who actually stabbed Luis .\nWitness testimony pointed to Jett as Luis \u2019 killer , while Nunez stabbed two other boys who survived .\nWas that enough to pin first- or second-degree murder on Esteban Nunez ?\nThe question no longer needed an answer when all sides agreed to a deal .\nNunez and Jett pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter .\n\u201c I couldn \u2019 t believe we were giving this case away , \u201d said Rick Clabby , then deputy district attorney , in an interview with CNN .\nNow retired , Clabby believes the evidence was strong enough for at least a second-degree murder conviction .\n\u201c We charged Nunez with conspiracy , too , \u201d Clabby said .\n\u201c It didn \u2019 t matter if the jury couldn \u2019 t decide who was the stabber. \u201d But Dumanis stressed the emotional toll on the victims and approved the deal .\nAs part of the plea , Nunez admitted that his actions led to the death of Luis Santos .\nBoth Nunez and Jett were sentenced to the maximum of 16 years in prison .\nCalling it \u201c bitter satisfaction , \u201d the Santoses thought their son \u2019 s newly confessed killers would go away quietly and pay for their crimes , content with the plea deal they had just reached .\n\u201c Had I known what was going to happen , \u201d said Dumanis , \u201c that ( deal ) never would have been an agreement. \u201d The governor \u2019 s final act On January 2 , 2011 , six months after their son \u2019 s convicted killers were sent to prison , the phone rang at the home of Fred and Kathy Santos .\nIt was another reporter .\n\u201c That \u2019 s been the story of our life , a reporter calls the house and gives me information , \u201d said Kathy Santos .\nThis time , she was told of the surprise commutation and immediately went online for more information .\n\u201c There was Esteban \u2019 s face , \u201d she said , \u201c with a little blurb about Arnold \u2019 s dirty deed. \u201d Minutes before leaving office , Schwarzenegger announced the commutation in an emailed news release .\nEsteban Nunez \u2019 s sentence had been cut in half .\nHe would be eligible for release in April of 2016 .\n\u201c I was so disgusted , \u201d Kathy Santos said .\n\u201c Esteban has been coddled , he hasn \u2019 t had to be accountable because apparently his father has gotten him off. \u201d Fabian Nunez has publicly denied he forced Schwarzenegger into granting a favor , but he also wasn \u2019 t complaining .\nNunez has repeatedly maintained that his son got a raw deal because he was related to a powerful lawmaker .\n\u201c From the beginning , my son was the headliner in the case , \u201d Nunez told CNN affiliate KCRA in 2011 .\nHe declined CNN \u2019 s repeated requests for an interview , but after an initial version of this story aired on television , Nunez spoke to CNN over the phone .\n\u201c This has gone from aiding and abetting to him being labeled a killer , \u201d Nunez said of his son .\nHe argues that comments from the Santos family , their attorneys and the district attorney \u2019 s office have boiled the case down to a convenient narrative : Esteban Nunez accepted a plea deal , then had it cut in half because of the influence of his father .\nIn reality , Fabian Nunez told CNN , \u201c the case is more complicated , \u201d and that his son sought clemency to right wrongs perpetrated on them by an \u201c overzealous district attorney \u201d and a \u201c conservative judge. \u201d \u201c My son did not want to take the deal \u201d if it meant he had to accept 16 years behind bars , Nunez said .\n\u201c He was going to go to trial \u201d and defend his position that Esteban was not nearly the aggressor that the prosecution was making him out to be .\n\u201c This was a fight among a large group \u201d of people , Fabian Nunez said , adding that the two suspects who were given probation in exchange for their testimony \u201c were just as responsible as my son. \u201d In a letter to the court objecting to the sentence , Fabian Nunez claims the judge overreached in giving Esteban the full 16 years because his son , unlike Jett , \u201c had no criminal record \u201d and that Esteban \u201c did not harm Mr. Santos , \u201d referring to the witness who claimed Jett inflicted the fatal blow .\nFabian Nunez went on to claim his son was misled by the judge , who \u201c told us that ( he ) would treat Esteban differently \u201d from Jett .\n\u201c He told the attorney one thing in chambers , then went into open court and said another , \u201d Fabian Nunez told CNN .\nProsecutors maintain they warned Esteban in open court that he could receive 16 years .\nThe judge denied that he made conflicting statements and refused to reconsider the sentence .\nEsteban Nunez and his attorneys continued their fight until December 6 , when they submitted a motion to end their appeal .\nLess than a month later , Nunez received clemency .\n\u201c I believe Nunez \u2019 s sentence is excessive , \u201d wrote Schwarzenegger in his commutation letter , citing the lack of criminal history and the inability to prove that Nunez actually stabbed Luis Santos .\n\u201c It was a complete betrayal of a system of justice and fairness , \u201d said Dumanis , the district attorney , who questions whether Nunez even submitted a clemency application to the governor .\nNunez \u2019 s attorney , Charles Sevilla , told CNN he did but refused to release it .\nUpon his exit , Schwarzenegger ordered all clemency files sealed for 25 years .\n( That \u2019 s not necessarily unusual .\nSchwarzenegger \u2019 s predecessor , Gray Davis , did the same thing . )\nIn his only comment about the case , Schwarzenegger told Newsweek , \u201c There \u2019 s criticism out there .\nI think it \u2019 s just because of our ( Fabian Nunez ) working relationship and all that .\nIt maybe was kind of saying , \u2018 That \u2019 s why he did it. \u2019 Well , hello !\nI mean , of course you help a friend. \u201d Fabian Nunez told CNN he was told by Schwarzenegger that the comments were \u201c taken out of context. \u201d Still , the Santos family attorney , Nina Solarno , was outraged .\n\u201c He took a political favor and played God , and took justice away from this family , \u201d claimed Solarno , who is also a board member for the advocacy group Crime Victims United .\nIn a private letter to the Santos family , Schwarzenegger wrote : \u201c I recognize that the last minute nature of my final acts as Governor provided you no notice , no time to prepare for or absorb the impact of this decision .\nFor that , I apologize. \u201d It was an apology the Santos family would not accept .\nTaking on the Terminator While Arnold Schwarzenegger returned to Hollywood in 2011 , Fred and Kathy Santos returned to court .\nAlong with the San Diego County district attorney , they filed suit alleging Gov .\nSchwarzenegger violated \u201c Marsy \u2019 s Law , \u201d which mandates that victims \u2019 families be given a right to speak in all proceedings related to their case .\nIt was the last chance Dumanis had to keep Esteban Nunez behind bars and repair the damage from what she considered a tremor shaking the entire system .\n\u201c When a governor commutes a sentence in such a flagrantly political way , it puts everybody in the system on notice that their ( deals ) are not safe , \u201d Dumanis said .\nWhile agreeing Schwarzenegger \u2019 s move was \u201c grossly unjust \u201d and \u201c deserving of censure , \u201d two separate judges concluded that it was not illegal and that \u201c Marsy \u2019 s Law \u201d applied to parole hearings , not executive clemency .\nSchwarzenegger , for now , had won .\nBut both the Santoses and San Diego prosecutors were not giving up .\nThey succeeded in changing the state law , which now requires California governors to give victims and prosecutors at least 10 days of notice before issuing clemency .\nThat will ensure Luis Santos \u2019 case isn \u2019 t repeated , but it won \u2019 t keep Esteban Nunez from being released .\nWhile the Santos family will next petition the state Supreme Court , they know time is running out .\n\u201c Esteban is going to be out before we get to the Supreme Court , \u201d Solarno conceded .\n\u201c Now we want an acknowledgment that the family \u2019 s rights were taken from them , that they should have been heard , and that from this day forward your case is setting precedent that other victims are going to be heard. \u201d Photos : Before Schwarzenegger was the \u2018 Terminator \u2019 Arnold Schwarzenegger did not respond to CNN \u2019 s requests for a formal interview , but when questioned by CNN at the \u201c Terminator Genysis \u201d premiere in June , he would not speak about the case .\n\u201c Since we \u2019 re here today for the movie promotion , we talk movies , \u201d he said .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the type of person he is , \u201d said Fred Santos .\n\u201c He thinks somebody being murdered \u2013 it \u2019 s news that is below his status. \u201d \u201c I get their pain , \u201d Fabian Nunez said , adding that his attempt to reach out to the Santos family wasn \u2019 t accepted .\n\u201c I get to see my son , they don \u2019 t get to see theirs \u2026 but I make no apologies for fighting for justice for my son. \u201d For Rick Clabby , the vocal former prosecutor , the Santos family has been victimized too many times in this case .\n\u201c They were victimized when their son was murdered , they were victimized when our office made this stupid decision and they were victimized when the governor buddied up with Mr. Nunez , \u201d Clabby told CNN .\nBut Fred and Kathy Santos say they \u2019 ll continue to fight .\nThey \u2019 re not sure where it will lead them , but they know they have to keep trying .\n\u201c We weren \u2019 t there to protect Luis , to prevent him from being killed , \u201d Fred Santos said .\n\u201c This is the only thing we can do for him . \u201d"}

''\nNo bombs found The standoff , which began around 9:45 a.m. local time Monday , ended when a loud bang was heard from the caf\u00e9 and five people ran out .\nShortly after , police swooped in , amid heavy gunfire , shouts and flashes .\nA police bomb disposal robot also was sent into the building , but no explosives were found .\nThere were originally 17 people inside the caf\u00e9 when the siege began .\nPolice said an investigation is underway because police were involved in an incident in which people died .\nMonis came to Australia as a political refugee from Iran and was granted asylum .\nHe has long been on officials ' radar .\nLast year , he was sentenced to 300 hours of community service for using the postal service to send what a judge called `` grossly offensive '' letters to families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2009 .\nAt the time , Monis said his letters were `` flowers of advice , '' adding : `` Always , I stand behind my beliefs .

''\nIt is considered the first of Islam 's five pillars of faith and is similar to the Lord 's Prayer in Christianity .\nIt is pervasive throughout Islamic culture , including the green flag of Saudi Arabia .\nJihadis have used the Shahada in their own black flag .\nChannel 10 news said it received a video in which a hostage in the caf\u00e9 had relayed the gunman 's demands .\nThe station said police requested they not broadcast it , and Scipione separately asked all media that might be contacted by the gunman to urge him instead to talk to police .\nA number of Australian Muslim groups condemned the hostage-taking in a joint statement and said the flag 's inscription was a `` testimony of faith that has been misappropriated by misguided individuals . ''\nAustralians show solidarity with Muslims In a show of solidarity on Twitter , many Australians offered to accompany people dressed in Muslim clothes who were afraid of a backlash after the caf\u00e9 siege .\nThe hashtag # IllRideWithYou had been used more than 90,000 times by late Monday evening local time .\nSeven Network television news staff watched the gunman and hostages for hours from a fourth-floor window of their Sydney offices , opposite the caf\u00e9 .\nThe gunman could be seen pacing back and forth past the caf\u00e9 's windows .\nReporter Chris Reason said the man carried what appeared to be a pump-action shotgun , was unshaven and wore a white shirt and a black cap .\nSome of the hostages were forced up against the windows .\n`` The gunman seems to be sort of rotating these people through these positions on the windows with their hands and faces up against the glass , '' Reason said in a report from the vantage point .\n`` One woman we 've counted was there for at least two hours \u2014 an extraordinary , agonizing time for her surely having to stand on her feet for that long . ''\n`` When we saw that rush of escapees , we could see from up here in this vantage point the gunman got extremely agitated as he realized those five had got out .\nHe started screaming orders at the people , the hostages who remain behind , '' he added .\nReason later reported that staff brought food from a kitchen at the rear of the caf\u00e9 and the hostages were fed .\nLindt sends sympathies on Facebook As night set in , the lights inside the caf\u00e9 were switched off .\nArmed police guarding the area outside fitted their helmets with green-glowing night goggles .\n`` This is a very disturbing incident , '' Prime Minister Tony Abbott said .\n`` It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation .

with six windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines .\n\u201c We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart , the bodies are in a state of destruction , there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage , \u201d Brice Robin , prosecutor for the city of Marseille , told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter .\nGermanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight .\nSpain \u2019 s deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names .\nOne Belgian was also aboard .\nAlso among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the

familiar with because one of my cousins was a pediatric neurologist for many years at the world famous Great Ormond Street hospital in London .\nYou don \u2019 t get to specialize in the medical

presume , is also highly intelligent and has also helped save many young lives .\nWhen Ben Carson first entered the political arena , I thought he might be a breath of fresh air : a black republican brain surgeon .\nIt \u2019 s fair to say you don \u2019 t get too many of those to the dollar in Washington .\nBut then he started speaking So why does he persist in making public statements that make him sound like the most brainless berk in America ?\nWhen he first entered the political arena , I thought he might be a breath of fresh air : a black republican brain surgeon .\nIt \u2019 s fair to say you don \u2019 t get too many of those to the dollar in Washington .\nBut then he started speaking .\nHe compared homosexuals to bestiality and announced that being homosexual was \u2018 absolutely \u2019 a choice , explaining : \u2018 A lot of people go into prison straight and when they come out , they \u2019 re gay. \u2019 He followed this by saying that Obamacare , a policy established to bring 30 million uninsured poor people into healthcare , was \u2018 the worst thing to happen to the nation since slavery \u2019 , adding : \u2018 And it is slavery in a way. \u2019 His next pronouncement was that America is now \u2018 very much like Nazi Germany \u2019 and the Obama administration acts \u2018 like the Gestapo \u2019 .\nYes , he compared this government to one that committed the Holocaust .\nMore recently , he declared that no Muslim could ever become president , despite the U.S. constitution making it very clear that \u2018 no religious Test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust in the United States. \u2019 By now I was fairly convinced that Dr Carson was a nasty little bigot .\nWhat I didn \u2019 t expect him to be was stupid , or a man lacking in principle even if I didn \u2019 t agree with those principles .\nBut then came the issue of guns .\nIn 2013 , Glenn Beck asked Dr Carson if people should be allowed to own semi-automatic weapons .\nHe replied : \u2018 I think if you live in the midst of a lot of people and the semi-automatic weapon is going to fall into the hands of a crazy person , I would rather you not have it. \u2019 I cheered this sensible view from what seemed to be a very sensible man .\nBut reaction from the hard-right gun lobby was fast and furious .\nBen Carson really went crazy , telling ABC News that if he \u2019 d been confronted as the victims were in Oregon he \u2019 d have attacked the gunman and asked everyone else to as well .\nPictured : Gunman Chris Harper-Mercer Conservative commentator Dana Loesch said \u2018 a lot \u2019 of people like Dr Carson but \u2018 his belief of restriction of gun rights is a deal-killer \u2019 .\nThe irony of course being that his call for a restriction of military assault rifles for civilians would actually stop less things being killed .\nSince the mass school shooting in Oregon , though , Dr Carson \u2019 s had a re-think about guns .\nOr more of a cowardly U-turn for pure political expediency .\n\u2018 Guns don \u2019 t kill people , \u2019 he told Fox & Friends yesterday , with a straight face .\nLater , he stopped by The View and said he \u2019 d like kindergarten teachers to be armed .\nThen , asked by Fox News if he \u2019 d go the scene of the Oregon shooting as President Obama is doing , he replied : \u2018 I would probably have so many things on my agenda that I \u2019 d go to the next one. \u2019 Finally , he went really bats * * t crazy , telling ABC News that if he \u2019 d been confronted as the victims were in Oregon he \u2019 d have attacked the gunman and asked everyone else to as well .\nThe clear message being that the students who died had somehow failed to show his kind of Rambo strength of character in their moment of horrendous terror .\nBut victim-blaming wasn \u2019 t even Dr Carson \u2019 s most hideous statement on guns in the last 48 hours .\nIn a Facebook posting on Monday night , he said this : \u2018 As a Doctor , I spent many a night pulling bullets out of bodies .\nThere is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking \u2013 but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away. \u2019 WHAT ?\nI \u2019 d love to take Dr Carson to Sandy Hook today and show him the photographs of those 20 slaughtered children .\nEach of their small bodies punctured by 3 to 11 bullets leaving holes the size of golf balls ( I repeat this detail a lot , because I want people to know it and visualize it ) One of America \u2019 s leading surgeons believes no bullet-ridden body of a fellow American can ever be worse than gun control measures designed to stop the shooting happening in the first place ?\nI \u2019 d love to take Dr Carson to Sandy Hook today and show him the photographs of those 20 slaughtered children .\nEach of their small bodies punctured by 3 to 11 bullets leaving holes the size of golf balls ( I repeat this detail a lot , because I want people to know it and visualize it ) .\nThen I want to hear him tell the parents of those kids that their annihilation wasn \u2019 t as devastating as him having to give up guns .\nHe wouldn \u2019 t have the courage to say it to their faces , of course .\nIn fact , Dr Carson seems a particularly gutless individual generally for one with such an eminent resum\u00e9 .\nA man who loves to bill himself as a charming , respectable , humble , smart brain surgeon .\nBut who in reality is an unpleasant , arrogant , sneering piece of work pandering to the very worst elements of the far-right GOP membership , and prepared to chop and change his views on a whim to secure their support .\nMy neurologist cousin is a man of great kindness , sensitivity and genuine humility .\nThe staggering thing about Dr Carson is that he can , by all accounts , show all these qualities in a surgery room .\nBut when running for president he prefers to be casually vicious , prejudiced and callous .\nThe most dangerous people in politics are often the most intelligent .\nThey know best how to manipulate the masses , and to get what they want .\nAn America run by Dr Carson would be a shameful place .\nOne where intolerance is king and death is inconsequential ."}

{"label": false, "txt": "If Putin is dead or incapacitated , here are three scenarios for what might happen nextRussian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi at the Kremlin in Moscow , March 5 , 2015 .\nREUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin For a decade and a half , Vladimir Putin has sat at the top of a closed , hierarchical , and personality-based political system that allows for no competition .\nAs a result , opinion polls in Russia routinely show the public sees `` no alternative '' to Putin 's leadership .\nSo what would happen in Russia if Putin suddenly and without warning left the political stage ?\nOver the last few days , we have seen the anxiety that even the rumor of such an event can produce in Russia and around the world .\nIf Putin is the guarantor of stability in Russia , then does a scenario without Putin automatically imply instability \u2014 even violent instability ?\nThe Constitutional Scenario Formally , of course , Russia has a constitution and a process for handling a president 's incapacity .\nArticle 92 of the Russian Constitution states that if the president is unable to fulfill the duties of the office \u2014 although the process for declaring him incapacitated is unclear \u2014 the prime minister would become acting president and a new presidential election would be held within three months .\nThe acting president would not have the power to disband the Duma , schedule a referendum , or alter the constitution .\nRussian Prime Minister Medvedev Sergei Karpukhin/REUTERS Under Russian election law , each party represented in the State Duma\u2014 United Russia , the Communist Party , the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia , and A Just Russia \u2014 would have the right to nominate a candidate .\nOther parties would have to scramble to assemble the required 100,000 signatures and get them approved by the Central Election Commission in such a tight time frame .\nSo if Putin unexpectedly left the scene and the constitution were followed to the letter , Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would return to the Kremlin and a competitive election would take place in three months .\nThe Consensus Scenario Of course , such a smooth and legal transition of power is unlikely in Russia .\nBoris Yelstin , then-president and Putin , then-prime minister , in December 1999 Wikimedia In Soviet times , political heavyweights wrestled behind the scenes until a successor emerged through some unfathomable communist alchemy .\nMore recently , when President Boris Yeltsin decided to retire , political insiders reached a consensus and produced the unimaginable candidacy of Vladimir Putin as his successor .\nThey then used a combination of their financial , administrative , and media resources to get him elected .\nYeltsin 's inner circle , despite its divisions , had the benefit of time in making its decision .\nIn addition , they also had the experience of reaching a similar crucial consensus during the period around the 1996 presidential election , when the major oligarchs agreed to work together to reelect the ailing and increasingly unpopular Yeltsin .\nThe Conflict Scenario But what if consensus ca n't be reached ?\nUnder Putin , the political system has become more personalized and centered around the president himself , who has balanced conflicting parties .\nAnd he has almost certainly stifled all discussion of what could or should happen in a post-Putin era .\nMarko Djurica/Reuters But the divisions in Putin 's inner circle , always latent , have become more manifest with the Ukraine crisis and have intensified since the February 27 assassination of opposition figure Boris Nemtsov .\n`` Now the conflict between the clans has become very seriously intense , '' says journalist and analyst Raf Shakirov .\n`` It is obvious that different groups are pushing for different paths . ''\nThe main fault line , he says , is between `` hawks '' who have become ascendant due to the Ukraine crisis and Russia 's showdown with the West and a `` liberal group '' responsible for the economy who would prefer a thaw at home and a rapprochement abroad .\nThe former group , Shakirov says , will probably fight fiercely in any transition to preserve their primacy .\n`` This group understands that for them any normalization would mean , not the end of the world , but a loss of position , '' Shakirov says .\n`` They can not risk the loss of the almost unlimited power that they have now . ''\nLikewise , political analyst Marat Guelman sees conflict as the likely scenario .\nThese are `` people who have tasted lawlessness , who already feel that they have the right to break the law , to kill , '' he says in reference to the Kremlin hard-liners .\nWith reporting by RFE/RL 's Russian Service correspondents Yelena Rykovtseva and Lyubov Chizhova"}

{"label": false, "txt": "Hickory ( NC ) Walmart Human Trafficking WarningAdvertisment : Claim : A woman and her daughter narrowly avoided sex traffickers in the parking lot of a Hickory , North Carolina , Walmart .\nRating : About this rating Unproven On 4 August 2015 , a Facebook user published a claim that she and her daughter had encountered kidnappers working on behalf of human traffickers in the parking lot of a Walmart store in Hickory , North Carolina : My daughter saved my life today !\nMy daughter , Amanda [ ... ] , and I were at Wal Mart in hickory earlier and were walking back to the car when we were approached by a young , nice looking man in a gray suit by a big white van with two ladders on top .\nHe was handing out gift bags of make up samples .\nAs we walked by , he came up to us and said , `` Just in time ! ''\nAnd , while following us to the car , kept insisting that we take the gift bags .\nYou could see the fear in Mandy 's face while I had no clue what was going on other than a persistent salesman trying to make some sort of deal .\nMandy read about men going around giving out free samples of different things to women only and then after they accept them , they are kidnapped and then sold into the sex slave trade .\nApparently , women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam .\nShe repeatedly refused him while I was dazed and confused as to what was going on .\nShe finally demanded that I get in the car , then explained everything .\nIf I had been alone , I would be on my way to God knows where right now .\nIf this happens to any of you ladies , RUN !\nGo back in the store and tell somebody !\nAnd do n't go to WalMart or any other store alone if you do n't have to !\nThank you , Jesus for giving me a daughter that 's smarter than I am and for watching out for both of us .\nP.S .\nA few of you have shared this post and I want to say thank you so much !\nI encourage everybody who reads this to PLEASE share this post and get the word out !\nYou could be saving a life !\nThe claim bore many similarities to a rash of similar rumors shared by social media users that summer .\nIn May 2015 , a separate Facebook user claimed she was scouted in a similar fashion at an Oklahoma Hobby Lobby store ; in June , Twitter was awash in warnings of sex slavery rings targeting college kids via summer job interviews ; later that month the theme park abduction urban legend recirculated ; and simultaneously , a terrifying tale of purported drug-dispensing teenaged assailants in the bathroom of a Denton , Texas , Dillards department store made the same rounds .\nAs with some of the near-subsequent rumors , the Hickory Walmart sex trafficking claim resembled a few long-circulating urban legends .\nThe use of a desirable gift to `` soften '' potential victims to the abductor 's approach echoed an enduring ( but false ) story about carjackers utilizing $ 100 bills as bait to lure victims .\nIt was also similar to widely-circulated ( and old ) rumors about ill-intentioned folks trawling parking lots with drugged perfume samples .\nFinally , the claim was n't dissimilar to the more recent Hobby Lobby abduction rumor in as much as it was quite likely based ( at least in part ) on a real-life event , and the poster 's account was not implausible as unwelcome solicitations involving pesky salespeople indeed occur from time to time in busy parking lots .\nBut nothing the woman wrote definitively pointed to ( or even hinted ) at anything more interesting than an unwanted sales pitch .\nThe claim that `` men [ are ] going around giving out free samples of different things to women only and then after they accept them , they are kidnapped and then sold into the sex slave trade '' was n't a very logical one , as nothing prevents a potential kidnapper from abducting a victim who refused the offer of a gift bag ( and acceptance of a bag of makeup does n't make anyone easier to kidnap ) .\nThe assertion `` women all over North Carolina have fallen victim to this scam '' is unsupported by news reports ( and inaccurate , given that the scenario described constitutes a serious crime and not a `` scam '' ) .\nA search for incidents that matched the above account in Hickory yielded some unrelated results of note , albeit none substantiating rumors of human trafficking activity .\nOn 6 August 2015 ( after the status update above was shared , not before ) the Hickory Daily Record published an article about `` meth trafficking '' in the parking lot of a local Walmart .\nChronological aspects aside , the article specifically described drug ( and not human ) trafficking and did not reference any sort of sex-related crime .\nA separate article titled `` Human trafficking rampant in NC ? ''\nwas published in the same paper on 29 June 2015 .\nAlthough that article made no specific mention of incidents in or around Hickory , it might have inspired fears ( and subsequent `` sightings '' ) of sex ring operators among residents .\nIt is n't uncommon for more upsetting elements of a newspaper article to make an impression upon readers while general details fade more quickly , and the article in question described victims initially consenting ( under somewhat different and invariably coerced circumstances ) to go with an abductor or abuser : '' Slavery is not a new problem , but the fact that predators can find and groom victims through the internet heightens the danger to our children and grandchildren .\nBefore , traffickers would need to wander the streets looking for runaways , but now they can spend their days on Facebook , Instagram or Snapchat looking for vulnerable young people , '' [ author Kimberly ] Rea said , adding that many victims go with their traffickers willingly .\n`` We often think of trafficking in terms of people being abducted , but one study showed that only accounted for 11 percent of the trafficking cases .\nOver 30 percent were trafficked through offers of help ( a job , money , place to live , etc . ) .\nThe horrible part of that statistic was that over 50 percent of victims were trafficked by someone who pretended romantic interest . ''\nThe newspaper passage quoted above additionally serves as a decent reminder of why inaccurate warnings about sex trafficking ( often shared with a `` better safe than sorry '' caveat ) can do more harm than good .\nIndividuals potentially at risk of falling victim to traffickers would be better equipped with information about the circumstances under which human trafficking realistically occurs in the U.S. , and rarely is that between strangers with no previous acquaintance in a shopping mall or chain store parking lot .\nWe contacted police in Hickory , North Carolina , to determine whether they 're aware of any incidents at Walmart ( or elsewhere ) matching the example above .\nAccording to the department , no reports of attempted abductions or unwanted solicitations in local parking lots had been received ."}

'\nIn fact , it is believed that Planned Parenthood shooting suspect Robert Lewis Dear , 57 , was an evangelical Christian , rather than a Catholic .\nChallenged over the remarks by journalists who pointed out that it was the FBI themselves who announced their investigation is linked to terrorism , Abuershaid hit back .\nHe said : ' I think every investigation the FBI does when it 's involving a Muslim will involve some kind of terrorist investigation .

'\nIn the wake of these latest developments , an ISIS-affiliated news agency Aamaq claimed that Farook and Malik were 'supporters ' of the terror group , but it stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack in San Bernardino .\nBut Comey noted there 's still ' a lot evidence that does n't quite make sense ' .\nFarook and Malik had illegally modified their two AR-style rifles making it easier to kill a large number of people , officials revealed today .\nMeredith Davis , with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , said that while the weapons were purchased legally , they had undergone a number of illegal adjustments afterwards .\nOne of the weapons had been modified to allow it to fire on fully-automatic mode , while the other was fitted with a large magazine and had the 'bullet button ' removed to allow for quicker reloading .\nCalifornia law bans the sale of weapons with magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition , but it is not known how many bullets the weapons used in this week 's attack could hold .\nThe adjustments mean the rifles , a .223 caliber Smith & Wesson M & P 15 and a .223 caliber DPMS A-15 , would violate California 's ban on assault weapons , Davis told the Wall Street Journal .\nThe state has some of the toughest gun control laws in America , allowing the sale of handguns and assault-style rifles , but banning the sale of fully-automatic weapons .\nAll rifles sold in the state must also be fitted with a 'bullet button ' - meaning the magazine must be removed by using the tip of a bullet to trip the release mechanism , rather than a quick-release catch .\nIn total , Farook and Malik were carrying four guns - the two rifles and two semi-automatic handguns - and were in possession of 12 pipe bombs and around 4,500 rounds of ammunition .\nSyed Raheel Farook ( pictured yesterday left and right in a Facebook photo ) , the brother of San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook , is a decorated Navy veteran The stunning disclosure about the pledge of loyalty to the extremist group was preceded by news that investigators were looking into whether Malik was responsible for radicalizing Farook .\nAccording to Fox News , it is believed that on at least one of Farook 's two trips to Saudi Arabia in 2013 and 2014 , one or both of the spouses reached out to suspected members of al Qaeda .\nChristian Nwadike , a co-worker of Farook 's at the San Bernardino County health department , told CBS This Morning that the mild-mannered man was different upon his return from Saudi Arabia last year .\nWhen asked if he believed Farook may have been radicalized , Nwadike replied : 'Yes , by the wife .\nI think he married a terrorist . '\nNwadike said told CNN that he believes Farook was 'set up ' to commit the massacre through his marriage to Malik .\nAnother friend from the mosque , Abdul Aziz Ahmed , also said Farook stopped attending the mosque following his wedding , and said his radical behavior was completely out of character .\n'He was looking good , he seemed good ( after returning from Saudi Arabia ) , ' Ahmed told CNN .\n'But then he disappeared ( after the wedding ) . '\nAhmed , like many who knew Farook , are struggling to understand his actions .\n'He came to the mosque every day for two years .\nHow can this happen , a guy who was very good ? '\nAhmed said .\n'You did n't hear him talking about those mad men , these terrorists . '\nFarook was born in Chicago on June 14 , 1987 , to parents born in Pakistan .\nHe was raised in Southern California .\nIn July 2010 , he was hired as a seasonal public employee and served until December of that year , according to a work history supplied by San Bernardino County .\nIn January 2012 , he was rehired as a trainee environmental health specialist before being promoted two years later .\nAs for Malik , she came to the United States in July 2014 on a Pakistani passport and a fianc\u00e9e visa , authorities said .\nTo get the visa , immigrants submit to an interview and biometric and background checks - screening intended to identify anyone who might pose a threat .\nThe husband and wife unleashed a barrage of bullets on officers , who returned fire \u2013 and hit their rental Ford Expedition SUV ( pictured ) with 380 rounds The couple were armed with a .223-caliber DPMS Model A15 rifle , a Smith and Wesson M & P15 rifle as well as Llama handgun and a Smith and Wesson handgun ( pictured ) The couple had arrived dressed in black tactical-style vests and opened fire , before being killed in a police shootout .\nPictured : police released pictures of items recovered from the scene An officer looks over the evidence near the remains of a SUV involved in the police shootout in San Bernardino , California An additional 1,400 rifle rounds were found inside the bullet-riddled vehicle the pair used to evade police on Wednesday .\nPolice also recovered more than 2,000 handgun bullets A black and yellow duffel bag stuffed with home-made pipe bombs was recovered from a California home linked to suspects Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik Malik never came through Saudi Arabia and instead traveled through Islamabad , arriving on a K-1 visa for fianc\u00e9es and with a Pakistani passport .\nThe couple had a six-month-old daughter , who they left with Farook 's mother at the home they shared with her before heading to the center .\nThey reportedly told Farook 's mother that they were headed to a doctor 's appointment .\nFarook and Malik were married on August 16 , 2014 , in nearby Riverside County , according to their marriage license .\nBoth listed their religion as Muslim .\nFarook 's older sister , Saira Khan said that when she first saw the news broadcast that identified her brother and his wife as the suspected gunman , that she thought they had 'the wrong person ' .\nShe said in a sit-down interview with MSNBC that she went through phases of 'shock ' and disbelief ' that her 'introvert ' brother would do such a thing .\n' I had absolutely no idea that they were involved in anything like that , or that they were even capable of doing something like this , ' Khan said .\nThousands came out to honor the victims of the San Bernardino massacre at several vigils held in California on Thursday night Trinity Cuellar , two , puts a candle down at a candlelight vigil at San Manuel Stadium , for the victims of the mass shooting People hold candles as they attend a vigil at the San Manuel Stadium to remember those injured and killed during the shooting at the Inland Regional Center on Wednesday morning A woman holds a sign for Robert Adams , who died in a shooting on Wednesday , during a vigil for shooting victims at the San Manuel Stadium in San Bernardino on Thursday A woman in a headscarf reflects on the tragedy of Wednesday 's attack during a candlelight vigil in San Bernardino on Thursday She added that her government-worker brother who opened fire at a holiday party and was later killed was far from the brother that she knew .\n'The brother I grew up with , the shy introvert , kept-to-himself , quiet kid that we knew , grew up and got married , ' she said .\nAs for Farook 's wife , however , Khan said she did n't know much about Malik or her past .\n'His wife was recently here .\nShe was only here for two years , ' Khan told MSNBC .\n'We did n't really know her that well . '\nShe added , however , that she never saw anything that would suggest that they could be radicalized .\nKhan said in separate interview with CBS News this morning that it was 'mind-boggling ' to her that her brother and his wife would do something like this .\nHer husband , Farhan Khan , tearfully said that he was having a hard time forgiving his brother-in-law for the carnage he caused ."}

''\nWhile the rumor spread quickly and broadly on social media , credible supporting information was quite thin .\nThe Blaze summarized all available information on the `` patriotism ban '' rumor \u2014 which appears to have originated not with the school 's administration , but in an editorial published in the school 's newspaper .\nMoreover , those web sites were n't even able to confirm that such an editorial ( the existence of which was evident only in screenshots ) ever appeared in the school 's paper , much less that its claims were sanctioned by the administration : Students at Tempe \u2019 s Corona del Sol High School reportedly were set to wear red , white and blue to the game at Marcos de Niza High School , also in Tempe , but an apparent editorial in the Corona del Sol student newspaper indicated that was forbidden .\n\u201c It is the unfortunate truth that if you wear red , white or blue to the game you will not be admitted to the stadium , \u201d the editorial said .\n\u201c This is a fact. \u201d A link to the editorial was not active Friday , but screenshots said to be of the editorial were posted on Twitter ...\nWhen one person asked the newspaper staff for more specifics on what clothing shouldn \u2019 t be worn Friday night , the paper replied , \u201c Anything perceived to be offensive/racist : green , USA , flags , Trump , etc .\nIt \u2019 s not the clothing , but the intent behind it. \u201d The Twitter account ( @ CdSSunrise ) from which much of the information purportedly originated remained active on 23 October 2015 , but none of its tweets referenced the controversy .\nThe account 's name ( `` Sunrise Staff '' ) may have suggested that it was operated by district staff , when in actuality it looked to belong to the paper 's staff ( comprised of students ) .\nOn 23 October 2015 , the district addressed the rumors on their official account : Media reports of a ban of colors or flags @ tonight 's Corona del Sol vs. Marcos de Niza fball game are FALSE .\nNO ban .\nAll colors are welcome \u2014 TUHSD Communications ( @ TUHSD_News ) October 23 , 2015 That same day , KTAR published an article titled `` Phoenix-area school bans USA-themed clothing for rivalry game '' ; the title was later changed to `` District denies Phoenix-area school ban of USA clothing for rivalry game .

nomination with a scheme to follow the traditional Labor Day pivot point of the electoral schedule with a new push to position the Wisconsin governor as the most ardently anti-union presidential candidate since Robert \u201c Taft-Hartley \u201d Taft mounted his failing bid for the Republican nomination in 1952 .\nIn fairness to Taft , the late Ohio senator was never so unsympathetic to working Americans as Walker .\nBut he had attached his name to a legislative assault on the internationally respected right to organize unions and to collectively bargain\u2014an initiative that invited Southern segregationists to enact so-called \u201c right to work \u201d laws that dramatically undermined the Congress of Industrial Organizations \u2019 \u201c Operation Dixie \u201d and related efforts to develop multiracial economic and social cooperation in the region .\nOf course , Walker will not run as well as Taft did in his failed-but-credible attempt to wrestle the 1952 nomination from Dwight Eisenhower\u2014a mainstream Republican who , as president , would renew the party \u2019 s historic commitment to respect , and in many instances , aid unions .\nWalker \u2019 s campaign is in crisis .\nAt the start of August , he was widely considered to be one of the top three contenders for the Republican nomination .\nHis poll standing was such that Fox News positioned him next to emerging front-runner Donald Trump on the stage at the first debate .\nBut Walker \u2019 s performance in that debate was dismal .\nHis answers were vapid , and inquiries from the Fox hosts about his ever-changing positions and empty promises embarrassed a candidate who has always relied on Midwest-nice media to let him avoid questions about his competence .\nAs a result , Walker \u2019 s poll numbers quickly plummeted nationally and in the first-primary state of New Hampshire .\nMore recently , he has tanked in the essential first-caucus state of Iowa .\nWalker \u2019 s circumstance is so dismal that pre\u2013Labor Day polls had him falling to eighth place in the national competition , with just 3 percent support .\nHe is now perilously close to dropping below the line of qualification for first-tier in the upcoming debates .\nIf that happens , Walker could find himself debating Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal rather than Donald Trump and Jeb Bush .\nDC-insider Politico \u2019 s website convened a panel of analysts to assess how the last few months had gone for the presidential contenders .\nThe consensus was that , among the Republicans , Walker was \u201c the biggest loser of the summer. \u201d Noting the ridiculous title of Walker \u2019 s ghost-written campaign book , one political seer concluded that \u201c \u2018 Unintimidated \u2019 has given way to \u2018 uninformed \u2019 and \u2018 unprepared. \u2019 \u201d True enough .\nBut Walker always has a plan for when he is cornered : attack workers and their unions .\nThis is the career politician \u2019 s default position .\nHe has gone to it as a legislator , a county executive , and a governor .\nIt has never worked fiscally or economically .\nWisconsin \u2019 s finances are , as Trump notes , a mess .\nAnd the state \u2019 s job-creation record is dismal\u2014so bad that Walker was asked about it in the Fox debate as a part of a question regarding his failure to keep campaign promises .\nBut Walker and his allies still imagine the union-bashing gambit will work with low-information voters in early-caucus and -primary states .\nSo the governor\u2014who famously suggested that cracking down on teachers and nurses and other union members who questioned his policies in Wisconsin had prepared him to confront the most difficult global threats\u2014is ramping up the anti-union rhetoric .\nAnd the Super PAC that backs his candidacy , \u201c Unintimidated PAC , \u201d announced on the cusp of Labor Day weekend that it had reserved $ 16 million in ad time in Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada , and South Carolina for a blitz that will begin with attacks on the movements of organized workers that were once hailed by Abraham Lincoln , Teddy Roosevelt , Dwight Eisenhower , and Ronald Reagan .\nThe Unintimidated PAC ad \u2019 s script maintains a favorite Walker fantasy : that when he used a so-called \u201c budget repair bill \u201d to attack the collective bargaining rights of public-sector workers he was taking on \u201c the big-government union bosses. \u201d THE NATION IS READER FUNDED .\nYOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK .\nDONATE NOW !\nBut the images in the ad provide a reminder that this is a lie .\nThey show the crowds of teachers and nurses and librarians and police officers and firefighters and snowplow drivers who came to the state capitol in the deep winter of 2011 to assemble and petition for the redress of grievances .\nLaw-enforcement officials hailed the demonstrations as well-organized and peaceful , while expressing concern about the governor \u2019 s bombastic and threatening statements\u2014especially in a phone conversation with a caller Walker thought was one of the billionaire Koch brothers .\nWalker got a pass from much of the media in 2011 and 2012 , when he used tens of millions of dollars from out-of-state billionaires to finance a campaign against the protests and a recall initiative that was placed on the ballot with the petition signatures of close to a million Wisconsinites .\nNow , as part of their post\u2013Labor Day pivot , Walker and his allies will mount another free-spending campaign of distortion and division that proposes a bizarro-world \u201c populism \u201d in which an ally of billionaires who attacks the interests of working people is portrayed as a \u201c fighter \u201d who takes on special interests and \u201c never backs down. \u201d The problem , of course , is that Walker \u2019 s agenda , which was always based on economic fabulism , has been revealed as political fantasy as well .\nHe has no story to tell from Wisconsin .\nHis \u201c reforms \u201d did not work .\nHis approval rating has fallen to 39 percent in statewide surveys , and 75 percent of Wisconsin Republicans say tell pollsters they are not backing Walker for their party \u2019 s 2016 nomination .\nAnd the Republicans who plan to attend caucuses and vote in primaries do not appear to be any more interested in Walker \u2019 s anti-union bombast than they are in Lindsey Graham \u2019 s saber-rattling for another war in the Middle East .\nThe point , of course , is not that Republicans have become pro-labor .\nMost of the candidates for the party \u2019 s nomination are supporters of so-called \u201c right to work \u201d initiatives , as well as privatization schemes and assaults on the interests of teachers and other public employees .\nMost of them support so-called \u201c free-trade \u201d initiatives that threaten the livelihoods of private-sector workers .\n( Only former governor Mike Huckabee has met with major union leaders seeking support . )\nThe point is that Walker can not produce evidence that his \u201c unintimidated \u2019 assault on workers and their unions has yielded meaningful fiscal or economic progress .\nAttacking unions never yields the benefits that the attackers claim are just around the corner .\nThat \u2019 s because the first Republican president was right when he told Congress that \u201c Labor is prior to and independent of capital. \u201d Some truths are self-evident .\nAnd Abraham Lincoln stated one of them : \u201c Capital is only the fruit of labor , and could never have existed if labor had not first existed .\nLabor is the superior of capital , and deserves much the higher consideration . \u201d"}

{"label": false, "txt": "Ted Cruz 's bizarre , flimsy description of the alleged Planned Parenthood shooterTed Cruz has a \u2026 unique view of the man who allegedly attacked a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic last week .\nOn Sunday , the Republican presidential candidate said that instead of focusing on the suspected shooter 's pro-life beliefs , the media should perhaps acknowledge that the suspect was `` a transgendered leftist activist . ''\n`` The media promptly wants to blame him on the pro-life movement when at this point there 's very little evidence to suggest that , '' Cruz said .\n`` It 's also reported that he was registered as independent and as a woman and a transgendered leftist activist \u2014 if that 's what he is . ''\nBut being identified as a different gender on a voter registration database \u2014 in this case , something that was apparently caused by a clerical error \u2014 does not make someone transgender ( or `` transgendered , '' which is the wrong term ) , and there 's no other indication that the alleged shooter is trans .\nInstead , being trans is part of a deeply held identity , one that goes back to a young age for many trans people .\nAnd it has nothing to do with a person 's willingness to shoot others .\nWhat does it actually mean to be transgender ?\nSome people do n't identify their gender as the sex they were assigned at birth .\nSome people , for example , may have been born with a penis , and designated male at birth as a result , but later realize that they identify as women and typical social standards of masculinity or femininity do n't apply to them .\nThese people are adopting forms of gender identity and expression that are n't related to their body parts or what sex a doctor decided they are at birth .\nAnd to understand what transgender means , you have to understand what gender identity and expression are , and how both concepts differ .\nGender identity is someone 's personal identification as man , a woman , or a gender outside of societal norms .\nGender expression refers to characteristics and behaviors a person identifies with that can be viewed as masculine , feminine , a mix of both , or neither .\nThe vast majority of Americans are cisgender , meaning they identify with the sex they were assigned at birth .\nPerhaps because of this \u2014 and because people who are not cisgender have been visible in the mainstream media only relatively recently \u2014 there 's an exposure gap for many Americans : For them , it can be difficult to understand how , for instance , a person born with a vagina and raised as a woman might identify as a man .\nRelated 9 questions about gender identity and being transgender you were too embarrassed to ask Lily Carollo , a trans blogger in North Carolina , said she helps cisgender people expand their views on gender identity through a thought exercise that , if successful , conveys the feeling of being identified by others as the wrong gender .\nShe begins by asking people if a huge sum of money would get them to physically transition to the opposite gender .\nMost people say no , she said , because they 'd rather continue presenting themselves as the gender they were born as and identify with .\n`` If you go into why they 're answering no , they 'll usually say that it would n't feel right , '' Carollo said .\n`` That 's what you lock into .\nTake that sense and imagine if you had been born in the opposite body . ''\nA common misconception is that gender identity and expression are linked to sexual or romantic attraction .\nBut a trans person can identify as a man , even though he was assigned female at birth , and be gay ( attracted to other men ) , straight ( attracted to women ) , bisexual , asexual ( sexually attracted to no one ) , or attracted to a traditionally undefined gender ; trans women can also be sexually attracted to men , women , both , no one , or another preference .\nMara Keisling , executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality , acknowledged that this concept can be difficult to explain .\n`` If somebody was living as a man dating women , and now they 're living as a woman dating women , what does that mean ?\nThey were straight ; now they 're gay , '' Keisling said .\n`` But did their sexual orientation change , or were they always attracted to women ? ''\nThis infographic , put together by Trans Student Educational Resources , helps break through some of that confusion by showing how a person 's gender identity and expression fall outside characteristics like sexual orientation and sex assigned at birth : The idea behind these different forms of identity and expression is that traditional gender roles \u2014 how people are expected by society to act based on the gender assigned to them at birth \u2014 are a social construct , not a biological one .\nThis is a concept that causes a great deal of debate in religious and conservative circles , but it 's largely uncontroversial for many anthropologists who indicate that gender is flexible enough that different societies and people can construct and interpret it differently .\nSo transgender is a term used to describe someone 's deeply held gender identity and how it differs from societal standards and expectations .\nIt 's not something , as Cruz 's comments suggest , that someone declares as a whim right before voting .\nIf the suspected shooter is trans , then , it would very likely show up in far more aspects of his life , not just a one-off mention in a voter registration database that turned out to be no more than an error ."}

2-year-old girl and rolled over her head .\nAs the girl \u2019 s grandmother shouted , \u201c Stop !\nYou \u2019 ve hit a child ! \u201d the BMW \u2019 s driver paused , then switched into reverse and backed up over the girl .\nThe woman at the wheel drove forward once more , crushing the girl for a third time .\nWhen she finally got out from the BMW , the unlicensed driver immediately offered the horrified family a deal : \u201c Don \u2019 t say that I was driving the car , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Say it was my husband .\nWe can give you money. \u201d Advertisement It seems like a crazy urban legend : In China , drivers who have injured pedestrians will sometimes then try to kill them .\nAnd yet not only is it true , it \u2019 s fairly common ; security cameras have regularly captured drivers driving back and forth on top of victims to make sure that they are dead .\nThe Chinese language even has an adage for the phenomenon : \u201c It is better to hit to kill than to hit and injure. \u201d Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement This 2008 television report features security camera footage of a dusty white Passat reversing at high speed and smashing into a 64-year-old grandmother .\nThe Passat \u2019 s back wheels bounce up over her head and body .\nThe driver , Zhao Xiao Cheng , stops the car for a moment then hits the gas , causing his front wheels to roll over the woman .\nThen Zhao shifts into drive , wheels grinding the woman into the pavement .\nZhao is not done .\nTwice more he shifts back and forth between drive and reverse , each time thudding over the grandmother \u2019 s body .\nHe then speeds away from her corpse .\nAdvertisement Advertisement Incredibly , Zhao was found not guilty of intentional homicide .\nAccepting Zhao \u2019 s claim that he thought he was driving over a trash bag , the court of Taizhou in Zhejiang province sentenced him to just three years in prison for \u201c negligence. \u201d Zhao \u2019 s case was unusual only in that it was caught on video .\nAs the television anchor noted , \u201c You can see online an endless stream of stories talking about cases similar to this one. \u201d \u201c Double-hit cases \u201d have been around for decades .\nI first heard of the \u201c hit-to-kill \u201d phenomenon in Taiwan in the mid-1990s when I was working there as an English teacher .\nA fellow teacher would drive us to classes .\nAfter one near-miss of a motorcyclist , he said , \u201c If I hit someone , I \u2019 ll hit him again and make sure he \u2019 s dead. \u201d Enjoying my shock , he explained that in Taiwan , if you cripple a man , you pay for the injured person \u2019 s care for a lifetime .\nBut if you kill the person , you \u201c only have to pay once , like a burial fee. \u201d He insisted he was serious\u2014and that this was common .\nAdvertisement Advertisement Most people agree that the hit-to-kill phenomenon stems at least in part from perverse laws on victim compensation .\nIn China the compensation for killing a victim in a traffic accident is relatively small\u2014amounts typically range from $ 30,000 to $ 50,000\u2014and once payment is made , the matter is over .\nBy contrast , paying for lifetime care for a disabled survivor can run into the millions .\nThe Chinese press recently described how one disabled man received about $ 400,000 for the first 23 years of his care .\nDrivers who decide to hit-and-kill do so because killing is far more economical .\nIndeed , Zhao Xiao Cheng\u2014the man caught on a security camera video driving over a grandmother five times\u2014ended up paying only about $ 70,000 in compensation .\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In 2010 in Xinyi , video captured a wealthy young man reversing his BMW X6 out of a parking spot .\nHe hits a 3-year-old boy , knocking the child to the ground and rolling over his skull .\nThe driver then shifts his BMW into drive and crushes the child again .\nRemarkably , the driver then gets out of the BMW , puts the vehicle in reverse , and guides it with his hand as he walks the vehicle backward over the boy \u2019 s crumpled body .\nThe man \u2019 s foot is so close to the toddler \u2019 s head that , if alive , the boy could have reached out and touched him .\nThe driver then puts the BMW in drive again , running over the boy one last time as he drives away .\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Here too , the driver was charged only with accidentally causing a person \u2019 s death .\n( He claimed to have confused the boy with a cardboard box or trash bag . )\nPolice rejected charges of murder and even of fleeing the scene of the crime , ignoring the fact that the driver ran over the boy \u2019 s head as he sped away .\nThese drivers are willing to kill not only because it is cheaper , but also because they expect to escape murder charges .\nIn the days before video cameras became widespread , it was rare to have evidence that a driver hit the victim twice .\nEven in today \u2019 s age of cellphone cameras , drivers seem confident that they can either bribe local officials or hire a lawyer to evade murder charges .\nAdvertisement Perhaps the most horrific of these hit-to-kill cases are the ones in which the initial collision didn \u2019 t injure the victim seriously , and yet the driver came back and killed the victim anyway .\nIn Sichuan province , an enormous , dirt-encrusted truck knocked down a 2-year-old boy .\nThe toddler was only dazed by the initial blow , and immediately climbed to his feet .\nEyewitnesses said that the boy went to fetch his umbrella , which had been thrown across the street by the impact , when the truck reversed and crushed him , this time killing him .\nAdvertisement Advertisement Despite the eyewitness testimony , the county chief of police declared that the truck had never reversed , never hit the boy a second time , and that the wheels never rolled over the child .\nMeanwhile , one outraged website posted photographs appearing to show the child \u2019 s body under the truck \u2019 s front wheel .\nAdvertisement In each of these cases , despite video and photographs showing that the driver hit the victim a second , and often even a third , fourth , and fifth time , the drivers ended up paying the same or less in compensation and jail time than they would have if they had merely injured the victim .\nWith so many hit-to-kill drivers escaping serious punishment , the Chinese public has sometimes taken matters into its own hands .\nIn 2013 a crowd in Zhengzhou in Henan province beat a wealthy driver who killed a 6-year-old after allegedly running him over twice .\n( A television report claims the crowd had acted on \u201c false rumors. \u201d However , at least five witnesses assert on camera that the man had run over the child a second time . )\nAdvertisement Of course , not every hit-to-kill driver escapes serious punishment .\nA man named Yao Jiaxin who in 2010 hit a bicyclist in Xian and returned to make sure she was dead\u2014even stabbing the injured woman with a knife\u2014was convicted and executed .\nIn 2014 a driver named Zhang Qingda who had hit an elderly man in Jiayu Pass in Gansu province with his pickup truck and circled around to crush the man again was sentenced to 15 years in prison .\nAdvertisement Advertisement Both China and Taiwan have passed laws attempting to eradicate hit-to-kill cases .\nTaiwan \u2019 s legislature reformed Article 6 of its Civil Code , which had long restricted the ability to bring civil lawsuits on behalf of others ( such as a person killed in a traffic accident ) .\nMeanwhile , China \u2019 s legislature has emphasized that multiple-hit cases should be treated as murders .\nYet even when a driver hits a victim multiple times , it can be hard to prove intent and causation\u2014at least to the satisfaction of China \u2019 s courts .\nJudges , police , and media often seem to accept rather unbelievable claims that the drivers hit the victims multiple times accidentally , or that the drivers confused the victims with inanimate objects .\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Hit-to-kill cases continue , and hit-to-kill drivers regularly escape serious punishment .\nIn January a woman was caught on video repeatedly driving over an old man who had slipped in the snow .\nIn April a school bus driver in Shuangcheng was accused of driving over a 5-year-old girl again and again .\nIn May a security camera filmed a truck driver running over a young boy four times ; the driver claimed that he had never noticed the child .\nAnd last month the unlicensed woman who had killed the 2-year-old in the fruit market with her BMW\u2014and then offered to bribe the family\u2014was brought to court .\nShe claimed the killing was an accident .\nProsecutors accepted her assertion , and recommended that the court reduce her sentence to two to four years in prison .\nThis light sentence would still be more of a punishment than many drivers have received for similar crimes .\nBut it probably won \u2019 t be enough to keep the next driver from putting his car in reverse and hitting the gas ."}

Joe Pitts , R-Pa. , and Chris Smith , R-N.J. , denounced it on the House floor .\nBut it isn \u2019 t pro-lifers who should worry about the Giubilini-Minerva proposal .\nIt \u2019 s pro-choicers .\nThe case for \u201c after-birth abortion \u201d draws a logical path from common pro-choice assumptions to infanticide .\nIt challenges us , implicitly and explicitly , to explain why , if abortion is permissible , infanticide isn \u2019 t .\nLet \u2019 s look at some of those assumptions .\n1 .\nThe moral significance of fetal development is arbitrary .\nI often hear this argument from pro-choicers in the context of time limits on abortion .\nIn a debate last fall , I drew up a timeline of fetal development , week by week .\nThe response from Ann Furedi , chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service , was that it would be arbitrary to use any point in that timeline to draw a legal limit on abortion rights .\nGiubilini and Minerva seem to share this view .\n\u201c Abortions at an early stage are the best option , for both psychological and physical reasons , \u201d they write , conspicuously omitting the idea that abortions at an early stage are better than late ones for moral reasons .\n\u201c Merely being human is not in itself a reason for ascribing someone a right to life , \u201d they write .\n\u201c Indeed , many humans are not considered subjects of a right to life , \u201d such as \u201c spare embryos where research on embryo stem cells is permitted \u201d or \u201c fetuses where abortion is permitted. \u201d Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Furedi accepts birth as the first logical time limit , though not for reasons of fetal development .\n( See her comments 44 minutes into this video . )\nBut Giubilini and Minerva push beyond that limit .\nThey note that neural development continues after birth and that the newborn doesn \u2019 t yet meet their definition of a \u201c person \u201d \u2014 \u201c an individual who is capable of attributing to her own existence some ( at least ) basic value such that being deprived of this existence represents a loss to her. \u201d Accordingly , they reason , \u201c The moral status of an infant is equivalent to that of a fetus , that is , neither can be considered a \u2018 person \u2019 in a morally relevant sense. \u201d Advertisement Advertisement 2 .\nPrior to personhood , human life has no moral claims on us .\nI \u2019 ve seen this position asserted in countless comment threads by supporters of abortion rights .\nGiubilini and Minerva add only one further premise to this argument : Personhood doesn \u2019 t begin until sometime after birth .\nOnce that premise is added , the newborn , like the fetus , becomes fair game .\nThey explain : Advertisement [ I ] n order for a harm to occur , it is necessary that someone is in the condition of experiencing that harm .\nIf a potential person , like a fetus and a newborn , does not become an actual person , like you and us , then there is neither an actual nor a future person who can be harmed , which means that there is no harm at all .\n\u2026 In these cases , since non-persons have no moral rights to life , there are no reasons for banning after-birth abortions .\n\u2026 Indeed , however weak the interests of actual people can be , they will always trump the alleged interest of potential people to become actual ones , because this latter interest amounts to zero .\nAdvertisement Advertisement You may find this statement cold , but where \u2019 s the flaw in its logic ?\nIf the neurally unformed fetus has no moral claims , why isn \u2019 t the same true of the neurally unformed newborn ?\nAdvertisement Advertisement 3 .\nAny burden on the woman outweighs the value of the child .\nGiubilini and Minerva note that philosophers such as Peter Singer have presented arguments for neonaticide for many years .\nUntil now , these arguments have focused on what \u2019 s best for the baby\u2014in the words of recent Dutch guidelines , \u201c infants with a hopeless prognosis who experience what parents and medical experts deem to be unbearable suffering. \u201d Giubilini and Minerva merely push this idea one step further , calling their proposal \u201c \u2018 after-birth abortion \u2019 rather than \u2018 euthanasia \u2019 because the best interest of the one who dies is not necessarily the primary criterion for the choice. \u201d Advertisement \u201c Actual people \u2019 s well-being could be threatened by the new ( even if healthy ) child requiring energy , money and care which the family might happen to be in short supply of , \u201d they observe .\nAccordingly , \u201c if economical , social or psychological circumstances change such that taking care of the offspring becomes an unbearable burden on someone , then people should be given the chance of not being forced to do something they can not afford. \u201d An after-birth abortion might be warranted by any \u201c interests of actual people ( parents , family , society ) to pursue their own well-being \u201d \u2014including \u201c the interests of the mother who might suffer psychological distress from giving her child up for adoption. \u201d Advertisement Advertisement 4 .\nThe value of life depends on choice .\nPro-choicers don \u2019 t accept the idea that the path from pregnancy to maternity , being natural , must be followed .\nThey argue that the choice is up to the woman .\nSome assert that the life within her has no moral status until she chooses to give birth to it .\nAgain , Giubilini and Minerva simply extend this logic beyond birth .\nSince the newborn isn \u2019 t a person yet , its significance continues to hinge on its mother \u2019 s decision .\nNeonates \u201c might or might not become particular persons depending on our choice , \u201d the authors argue .\nUntil then , the newborn imposes no obligations on us , \u201c because we are not justified in taking it for granted that she will exist as a person in the future .\nWhether she will exist is exactly what our choice is about. \u201d Advertisement 5 .\nDiscovery of a serious defect is grounds for termination .\nFetal development can turn tragic at any point .\nMost people agree that abortion should be permitted when a grave defect is discovered at amniocentesis .\nIn the partial-birth abortion debate , pro-choicers extended this rationale , arguing that abortions in the third trimester should be permitted when horrible defects were identified at that stage .\nGiubilini and Minerva take this argument to the next level , noting that defects often remain undiscovered until birth : Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement An examination of 18 European registries reveals that between 2005 and 2009 only the 64 % of Down \u2019 s syndrome cases were diagnosed through prenatal testing .\nThis percentage indicates that , considering only the European areas under examination , about 1700 infants were born with Down \u2019 s syndrome without parents being aware of it before birth .\nOnce these children are born , there is no choice for the parents but to keep the child , which sometimes is exactly what they would not have done if the disease had been diagnosed before birth .\nAdvertisement The authors conclude that \u201c if a disease has not been detected during the pregnancy , if something went wrong during the delivery , or if economical , social or psychological circumstances change such that taking care of the offspring becomes an unbearable burden on someone , then people should be given the chance of not being forced to do something they can not afford. \u201d And it isn \u2019 t clear where the line against infanticide would be drawn .\n\u201c We do not put forward any claim about the moment at which after-birth abortion would no longer be permissible , \u201d Giubilini and Minerva write .\nThey doubt that \u201c more than a few days would be necessary for doctors to detect any abnormality in the child. \u201d But critics are already noting that many defects are discovered later .\nAdvertisement Advertisement In sum , the authors argue : If criteria such as the costs ( social , psychological , economic ) for the potential parents are good enough reasons for having an abortion even when the fetus is healthy , if the moral status of the newborn is the same as that of the infant and if neither has any moral value by virtue of being a potential person , then the same reasons which justify abortion should also justify the killing of the potential person when it is at the stage of a newborn .\nAdvertisement I don \u2019 t buy this argument , in part because I agree with Furedi that something profound changes at birth : The woman \u2019 s bodily autonomy is no longer at stake .\nBut I also think that the value of the unborn human increases throughout its development .\nFuredi rejects that view , and her rejection doesn \u2019 t stop at birth .\nAs she explained in our debate last fall , \u201c There is nothing magical about passing through the birth canal that transforms it from a fetus into a person. \u201d The challenge posed to Furedi and other pro-choice absolutists by \u201c after-birth abortion \u201d is this : How do they answer the argument , advanced by Giubilini and Minerva , that any maternal interest , such as the burden of raising a gravely defective newborn , trumps the value of that freshly delivered nonperson ?\nWhat value does the newborn have ?\nAt what point did it acquire that value ?\nAnd why should the law step in to protect that value against the judgment of a woman and her doctor ?\nWilliam Saletan \u2019 s latest short takes on the news , via Twitter :"}

''\nWe contacted the Lebanon Police Department to gather additional information , but the individual with whom we spoke directed us to the FBI 's local field office for more information .\nA police report [ PDF ] available on the jurisdiction 's web site indicated that police were summoned to the Lebanon Walmart in the early hours of 5 December 2015 .\nThe report did n't indicate who made the report ( whether it was a bystander or employee ) , what the suspicious activity in question was ( aside from the purchase of unspecified electronics ) , nor that the incident was viewed as suspicious by the officer : On Saturday December 5 , 2015 at approximately 0352 hours I was dispatched to 1800 S.

''\nPredictably , people felt increasingly unable to determine which claims were on the up-and-up and which were simply parodies of genuine debates about symbols .\nAccordingly , the recirculation a very old joke relating the picking of cotton balls from jars of over-the-counter medications ( such as Tylenol pain reliever ) to the picking of cotton on plantations by slaves has met a bifurcated online audience : some shared it to deliberately poke fun at what they deemed to be rampant oversensitivity , but others seemed unsure of whether it was plausibly serious given rapidly-changing standards of acceptable historical and racial discourse .\nAs evidenced by the multiple examples above , not everyone grasped the satirical nature of the claim about bottles of Tylenol , picking cotton , and parallels to slavery .\nSome social media users legitimately believed that `` CNN Breaking News '' had reported it as true , others stated Walmart had `` banned '' Tylenol .\nHowever , all claims of such a `` ban '' were humorous in nature , and no over-the-counter medication has been restricted in any fashion to avoid racially-related offense to consumers .\nLast updated : 16 July 2015 Originally published : 16 July 2015"}

{"label": false, "txt": "Obama collecting personal data for a secret race databaseA key part of President Obama \u2019 s legacy will be the fed \u2019 s unprecedented collection of sensitive data on Americans by race .\nThe government is prying into our most personal information at the most local levels , all for the purpose of \u201c racial and economic justice. \u201d Unbeknown to most Americans , Obama \u2019 s racial bean counters are furiously mining data on their health , home loans , credit cards , places of work , neighborhoods , even how their kids are disciplined in school \u2014 all to document \u201c inequalities \u201d between minorities and whites .\nThis Orwellian-style stockpile of statistics includes a vast and permanent network of discrimination databases , which Obama already is using to make \u201c disparate impact \u201d cases against : banks that don \u2019 t make enough prime loans to minorities ; schools that suspend too many blacks ; cities that don \u2019 t offer enough Section 8 and other low-income housing for minorities ; and employers who turn down African-Americans for jobs due to criminal backgrounds .\nBig Brother Barack wants the databases operational before he leaves office , and much of the data in them will be posted online .\nSo civil-rights attorneys and urban activist groups will be able to exploit them to show patterns of \u201c racial disparities \u201d and \u201c segregation , \u201d even if no other evidence of discrimination exists .\nObama is presiding over the largest consolidation of personal data in US history .\nHousing database The granddaddy of them all is the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing database , which the Department of Housing and Urban Development rolled out earlier this month to racially balance the nation , ZIP code by ZIP code .\nIt will map every US neighborhood by four racial groups \u2014 white , Asian , black or African-American , and Hispanic/Latino \u2014 and publish \u201c geospatial data \u201d pinpointing racial imbalances .\nThe agency proposes using nonwhite populations of 50 % or higher as the threshold for classifying segregated areas .\nFederally funded cities deemed overly segregated will be pressured to change their zoning laws to allow construction of more subsidized housing in affluent areas in the suburbs , and relocate inner-city minorities to those predominantly white areas .\nHUD \u2019 s maps , which use dots to show the racial distribution or density in residential areas , will be used to select affordable-housing sites .\nHUD plans to drill down to an even more granular level , detailing the proximity of black residents to transportation sites , good schools , parks and even supermarkets .\nIf the agency \u2019 s social engineers rule the distance between blacks and these suburban \u201c amenities \u201d is too far , municipalities must find ways to close the gap or forfeit federal grant money and face possible lawsuits for housing discrimination .\nCivil-rights groups will have access to the agency \u2019 s sophisticated mapping software , and will participate in city plans to re-engineer neighborhoods under new community outreach requirements .\n\u201c By opening this data to everybody , everyone in a community can weigh in , \u201d Obama said .\n\u201c If you want affordable housing nearby , now you \u2019 ll have the data you need to make your case. \u201d Mortgage database Meanwhile , the Federal Housing Finance Agency , headed by former Congressional Black Caucus leader Mel Watt , is building its own database for racially balancing home loans .\nThe so-called National Mortgage Database Project will compile 16 years of lending data , broken down by race , and hold everything from individual credit scores and employment records .\nMortgage contracts won \u2019 t be the only financial records vacuumed up by the database .\nAccording to federal documents , the repository will include \u201c all credit lines , \u201d from credit cards to student loans to car loans \u2014 anything reported to credit bureaus .\nThis is even more information than the IRS collects .\nThe FHFA will also pry into your personal assets and debts and whether you have any bankruptcies .\nThe agency even wants to know the square footage and lot size of your home , as well as your interest rate .\nFHFA will share the info with Obama \u2019 s brainchild , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , which acts more like a civil-rights agency , aggressively investigating lenders for racial bias .\nThe FHFA has offered no clear explanation as to why the government wants to sweep up so much sensitive information on Americans , other than stating it \u2019 s for \u201c research \u201d and \u201c policymaking. \u201d However , CFPB Director Richard Cordray was more forthcoming , explaining in a recent talk to the radical California-based Greenlining Institute : \u201c We will be better able to identify possible discriminatory lending patterns. \u201d Credit database CFPB is separately amassing a database to monitor ordinary citizens \u2019 credit-card transactions .\nIt hopes to vacuum up some 900 million credit-card accounts \u2014 all sorted by race \u2014 representing roughly 85 % of the US credit-card market .\nWhy ?\nTo sniff out \u201c disparities \u201d in interest rates , charge-offs and collections .\nEmployment database CFPB also just finalized a rule requiring all regulated banks to report data on minority hiring to an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion .\nIt will collect reams of employment data , broken down by race , to police diversity on Wall Street as part of yet another fishing expedition .\nSchool database Through its mandatory Civil Rights Data Collection project , the Education Department is gathering information on student suspensions and expulsions , by race , from every public school district in the country .\nDistricts that show disparities in discipline will be targeted for reform .\nThose that don \u2019 t comply will be punished .\nSeveral already have been forced to revise their discipline policies , which has led to violent disruptions in classrooms .\nObama \u2019 s educrats want to know how many blacks versus whites are enrolled in gifted-and-talented and advanced placement classes .\nSchools that show blacks and Latinos under-enrolled in such curricula , to an undefined \u201c statistically significant degree , \u201d could open themselves up to investigation and lawsuits by the department \u2019 s Civil Rights Office .\nCount on a flood of private lawsuits to piggyback federal discrimination claims , as civil-rights lawyers use the new federal discipline data in their legal strategies against the supposedly racist US school system .\nEven if no one has complained about discrimination , even if there is no other evidence of racism , the numbers themselves will \u201c prove \u201d that things are unfair .\nSuch databases have never before existed .\nObama is presiding over the largest consolidation of personal data in US history .\nHe is creating a diversity police state where government race cops and civil-rights lawyers will micromanage demographic outcomes in virtually every aspect of society .\nThe first black president , quite brilliantly , has built a quasi-reparations infrastructure perpetually fed by racial data that will outlast his administration .\nPaul Sperry is a Hoover Institution media fellow and author of \u201c The Great American Bank Robbery , \u201d which exposes the

new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you \u2019 ve come to expect from SeaWorld , and it \u2019 s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages. \u201d Other guests who attended the same performance reported that they were left confused when the handlers appeared unannounced , silently forced the full-grown elephant into the tank , and then walked out through the backstage door , all without saying a word or acknowledging the audience in any way .\nAdditionally , many said they were expecting someone to come on over the loudspeaker and tell them what was occurring , or at least mention the elephant \u2019 s name , but noted that no one ever did .\nOver the course of the half-hour show , the 12,000-pound animal reportedly grew increasingly panicked , making numerous futile attempts to scramble up and over the vertical sides of the enclosure .\nSources said the clapping and whistling from the audience slowly tapered off as the exhausted elephant made gradually slower circuits of the tank \u2019 s perimeter in a desperate search of any possible exit point it could use to save itself .\nAdvertisement \u201c It tried to smash through the side of the tank with its tusks at one point , which is when I thought some dolphins or an orca might come swimming out of the gate and help push the elephant to safety , which would have been incredible\u2014but nope , \u201d said SeaWorld guest Erika Morganstern , 22 , who suspected that the tank walls had been heavily reinforced , given the animal \u2019 s continuous , ultimately ineffectual efforts to throw its enormous bulk against the glass .\n\u201c Eventually , the elephant started making these crazy sorts of gurgling , trumpeting noises that got quieter and quieter before they stopped completely. \u201d \u201c I really wasn \u2019 t sure what to expect when I saw this show on the schedule , \u201d she added .\n\u201c But , yeah , it was pretty much just an elephant drowning. \u201d Advertisement Visitors said that following some violent , last-ditch floundering , the huge mammal at last became too worn out to continue treading water and succumbed .\nGuests watching the show from the underwater viewing area confirmed seeing the elephant drift slowly to the bottom of the tank , where it came to rest in a heap , its body reportedly shifting back and forth slightly due to the turbulence created by its prior struggling .\n\u201c No one really told us when the show was over , \u201d said season-pass holder Mariam O \u2019 Neill , 57 .\n\u201c After the elephant didn \u2019 t move for a while , people got up and started leaving .\nA few people stuck around for the Clyde & Seamore \u2019 s Sea Lion High show , which was coming up next. \u201d Advertisement According to sources , the Elephant Drowning attraction has been well-attended since its introduction earlier this month , with the Saturday afternoon show in particular , which reportedly features both a mother elephant and her calf , regularly filling to capacity .\nWhen reached for comment , SeaWorld representatives confirmed to reporters that their newest aquatic presentation consists entirely of an elephant drowning in a large tank of water and that it takes place in Shamu Stadium at the times listed on the park \u2019 s website .\nAdvertisement \u201c SeaWorld is proud to bring a brand-new attraction to its visitors , \u201d company representative Nancy Klemmer said .\n\u201c Our new show offers the same first-rate entertainment you \u2019 ve come to expect from SeaWorld , and it \u2019 s sure to be a huge hit with guests of all ages. \u201d \u201c Plus , the elephants absolutely love it , \u201d Klemmer added ."}

''\nI find this incredibly disturbing if it is in fact true and believe it should be reported if found to be factual .\nJammal Longmire , actually a black terrorist who tweeted pictures of himself with guns wanting to kill policemen or is it a conservative scare tactic ?\nOutspoken # BlackLivesMatter activist Jammal Longmire openly advocating for the murder of white cops # BlueLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/crj8G7vSpb \u2014 Dr. White ( @ RealDoctorWhite ) June 10 , 2015 Origins : In June 2015 , a screenshot of a Facebook post began circulating on social media , featuring an image that appeared to depict a young black man named Jammal Longmire posing with two guns and issuing the above-quoted threat to police officers .\nThe appearance of the Jammal Longmire rumor coincided with a then-ongoing controversy over police treatment of a young black girl at a pool party in McKinney , Texas , and most likely the image was created and/or garnered more attention due to what was at the time an ongoing race-related national debate .\nPurported screen captures of the post were shared to multiple social networks , with the original appearing to bear a date stamp of 8 June 2015 .\nA version published to Facebook on 10 June 2015 was shared hundreds of thousands of times , and an 11 June 2015 tweet held that `` Jammal Longmire '' was an `` outspoken Black Lives Matter activist '' ( a claim that apparently did not bear out , as we were unable to find a person of that name or likeness affiliated with the movement ) : Outspoken # BlackLivesMatter activist Jammal Longmire openly advocating for the murder of white cops # BlueLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/crj8G7vSpb \u2014 Dr. White ( @ RealDoctorWhite ) June 10 , 2015 The image certainly agitated social media users in a time of racial disharmony , and in subsequent months it continued to spread .\nYet apparently no trace of any Jammal Longmire existed on the Internet before the rumor became popular : if Longmire was an actual young man ( and prominent Black Lives Matter activist ) living in America , he maintained a highly atypical non-existent profile on social media and the Internet at large .\nSome folks speculated that Longmire concealed his accounts from view after the post went viral , but those subsequent actions could n't have retroactively eradicated all traces he would have left prior to 8 June 2015 .\nA search for Jammal Longmire restricted to items appearing before 8 June 2015 turns up only misdated references posted after the emergence of the rumor , and we were unable to locate any other evidence pertaining to the existence of a person by that name prior to then .\nNot only did Longmire seem to spring into existence with a controversial claim on 8 June 2015 , but the words `` Jammal '' and `` Longmire '' did n't appear consecutively at all on the Internet before that time .\nIt 's possible ( though rather implausible ) Longmire simply created a social media presence to post the image and make the threat and then disappeared back into the ether .\nHowever , national law enforcement agencies and Daytona Beach police treated reports about the post very seriously yet failed to to locate anyone remotely matching the name or photograph seen in the viral post .\n( It should be noted that Orlando television station WFTV described the post as belonging to Jammal Longmire but clearly did not verify whether such an individual existed . )\nFBI and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives are conducting a joint investigation into a Facebook post .\nOfficials say the post could be fake , but Chief Mike Chitwood said he received more than 500 emails about the threats .\n`` We have opened a joint investigation with the FBI , the ATF and the border patrol ( Border Patrol ? )\nto try and see who is behind these postings , '' Chitwood said .\nThe post , belonging to Jammal Longmire , calls for people to pick up guns and kill police officers , police said .\nPolice said the man in the picture is holding two assault rifles .\n`` Is this really an attack on the officers ?\nIs this person on that Facebook really who they say they are ?\nSo that 's what the investigation is trying to show out , '' Chitwood said .\n`` Look what happened in New York City , \u201d Chitwood said .\n\u201c I mean , you have a guy coming from Atlanta that is a little unstable , gets his hand on a couple guns , does n't have anything to lose , so I 'm just going to go up and assassinate two police officers . ''\nAuthorities said Facebook has been served a warrant for the address of the device used to make the threats .\nNone of the listed agencies turned up a Jammal Longmire in Daytona Beach or anywhere else .\nA Longmire family was located in Michigan but was deemed to be unrelated to the man in the controversial photographs .\nSimilarly , the educational institution whose name appeared on the shirt worn by the man in the photographs ( North Carolina A & T State University ) was unable to find him : This has been investigated internally and determined that he is not one of our students .\nhttps : //t.co/xNPd7BPn3b \u2014 North Carolina A & T ( @ ncatsuaggies ) June 16 , 2015 Some viewers observed that the firearms seen in the photograph were clearly corded as something being handled in a retail environment , some speculated they were attached to a video game , and others said they were secured in a fashion typically seen in gun stores .\nRegardless , the guns visible in the photograph clearly did n't belong to the individual holding them and may not even have been operational .\nSo while Jammal Longmire has remained a focus of social media outrage since June 2015 , neither local police , the FBI , nor the ATF ( Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ) were able to locate him or his corded guns .\nThe Longmire rumor or hoax was virtually identical to a similar racial controversy-based prank concerning a fictitious McDonald 's employee named Bubba Conroy who purportedly spat in white customer 's meals .\nThat claim also generated significant measures of outrage on social media sites but did not hold up under scrutiny .\nLast updated : 2 September 2015 Originally published : 2 September 2015"}

{"label": false, "txt": "Republicans Escalate Their War On Women To Attack Wounded Female VeteransThe most anti-woman Republican Party in American History escalated its attacks on women to deny wounded female veterans fertility treatments that would help them to have children in spite of wounds suffered while defending our country .\nThe Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act , a bill authored by Sen. Patty Murray ( D-Wash. ) that would require fertility treatment and counseling for `` severely wounded , ill , or injured '' military members or veterans , had been expected to proceed through the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee on Wednesday .\nBut Murray said she has asked that the bill be pulled thanks to proposed amendments from Sen. Thom Tillis ( R-N.C. ) -- including one that would have , in Tillis 's words , prevented the Department of Veterans Affairs from working with `` organizations that take human aborted babies ' organs and sell them . ''\nTillis , of course , is referring to the fraudulent and debunked video recorded in secret by other Republican operatives which claims to show Planned Parenthood officials engaged in the sale of fetal tissue .\nIt does not matter to Tillis -- or any Republican , it seems -- that the video was edited to deliberately deceive .\nIt provides a ready excuse for Republican males to exercise control over women 's bodies any way they possibly can , even if it means denying wounded women veterans the ability to have children .\nRepublicans have seized on the altered and edited video as a bludgeon to carry on their attacks against Planned Parenthood , an organization they hate because it provides women with safe and legal family planning services , counseling , and assistance with terminating unwanted pregnancies .\nIn this case it 's hard to tell whom Republicans hate more , women or veterans .\nEither way , the irony of denying women the ability to conceive by pandering to the anti-choice lobby seems to have been lost on Mr. Tillis and his Republican cohorts .\nTo illustrate just how cynical and petty his rationale is , Tillis points to a $ 900 donation made by the VA to a group that he ca n't even identify as Planned Parenthood , as `` justification '' for blocking this funding : Tillis cited a report by Congress ' nonpartisan Government Accountability Office on hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending for family planning and other health programs by six organizations , including Planned Parenthood .\nIn a footnote , that report said the VA had spent $ 900 on one of the organizations , but it did not say which one had received the money .\nA $ 900 donation , out of hundreds of millions of dollars .\nThis is how extreme they are .\nSenator Murray reacted with anger and dismay at the derailing of her legislation : '' I know some Republicans are trying to use this latest issue as just one more opportunity to roll back the clock and take away women \u2019 s health care options , '' Murray said .\n`` We can have that fight .\nWe \u2019 ve had it many times before .\nBut don \u2019 t pull veterans into the middle of it .\nDon \u2019 t take something that should be above politics -- our sacred duty to our veterans -- and pull it down into the muck of petty politics .\nIt \u2019 s not fair to veterans and their families , who have been hoping and praying for the opportunity to have children . ''\nParalyzed Veterans of America is deeply disappointed to learn that S. 469 , the 'Women Veterans and Families Health Services Act , ' has been pulled from the Senate VA Committee markup this afternoon due to amendments that serve no function but histrionic political grandstanding .\nShame on those who have placed political ideology ahead of the needs of veterans with catastrophic disabilities , particularly those with spinal cord injury or disease .\nThis bipartisan , critically needed legislation would lift an antiquated ban on VA providing fertility services to veterans who have incurred a severe injury to their reproductive organs .\nAs a result of the recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq , many young service members have suffered grievous injuries from explosive devices that have made them unable to conceive a child naturally .\nWhile the Department of Defense does provide assisted reproductive technologies , such as in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , to service members , VA does not ."}

{"label": false, "txt": "History Channel 's Bigfoot Captured Was a TV AbominationLast night , The History Channel aired a two-hour special entitled Breaking History : Bigfoot Captured , a title presumably chosen because it directly refers to the mission of said program in breaking any conceivable perception that a network like History Channel might possibly air programs about , oh I don \u2019 t know , history .\nLet \u2019 s say , for a second , in a purely hypothetical scenario , that I was made the supreme overseer of Hell , the realm of eternal punishment and suffering .\nIn Jim \u2019 s new and revised Hell dimension , there would be a level devoted entirely to television producers who conceived and aired content in the style of Bigfoot Captured .\nThere , surrounded by the wailing voices of 10,000 History Channel , Animal Planet and Discovery Channel executives , you would find the crews behind Mermaids : The Body Found , Megalodon : The New Evidence and others , sharing a cozy abode in the lake of fire .\nThat \u2019 s my dream scenario .\nOf course , in the real world , I suppose I would settle for everyone involved to simply be fired .\nAnd possibly put into a pillory and pelted with rotten vegetables , time permitting .\nThese shows , examples of so-called \u201c docu-tainment \u201d that have become commonplace ( and huge ratings successes ) on networks that have educational aims in their mission statements , are indicative of everything that is wrong in 21st century media .\nThe fact that you have networks such as History Channel , Discovery and Animal Planet willfully and consciously planting falsehoods into the minds of their audience is absolutely shameful .\nThere \u2019 s no other word for it .\nThe people involved should be ashamed of themselves , because they are causing very real , literal harm .\nThey \u2019 re actively performing the polemic opposite of their network \u2019 s stated function .\nI see no difference between this and learning that a grade school teacher is teaching your kid that we live in a Geocentric universe .\nYour response to this outrage is probably to say \u201c Oh come on , Jim , it \u2019 s entertainment .\nPeople know the sasquatch documentary they \u2019 re watching on History Channel is just entertainment .\nWhat \u2019 s the harm ? \u201d The problem is that no , not everyone knows it \u2019 s entertainment .\nAnd if you \u2019 re intelligent enough to know that , then you should also realize that it \u2019 s the impressionable people watching who most need a source they can actually trust in order to provide real information .\nThese people don \u2019 t need entertainment .\nThey need a network that \u2019 s actually serving their best interest\u2014and for the record , their best interest is \u201c Not having pseudoscientific beliefs that they \u2019 ll pass on to anyone in earshot. \u201d Still don \u2019 t believe that anyone takes a program like Bigfoot Captured seriously ?\nOkay , let me just go check Twitter for 30 seconds , hold on\u2026 Idk if thats a legit # bigfoot or not , but if it is\u2026Holy shit ! ! !\n# BigfootCaptured \u2014 Ron Nopwasky ( @

all doubt !\nBigfoot is REAL .\nA species of gigantopithecus .\n\u2014 Chad ( @ ChadJones_ ) November 10 , 2015 Those are all real tweets from real human beings that rolled in during the last half hour as I was sitting down to start writing this thing .\nWhether or not you want to admit it , or whether History Channel wants to admit it , these sentiments are indicative of at least a fair chunk of their audience .\nThey have a responsibility to not mislead these human beings .\nIt is their JOB to not allow people to believe this bullshit .\nThis is the responsibility that History Channel claims it 's upholding when a two-hour long program is preceded by a disclaimer on screen for a few seconds saying that the program features \u201c some dramatization. \u201d At least , that 's what I 'm told appeared , because I started watching 60 seconds after the program began .\nFor me , and anyone else who joined at any other point during that ludicrous 120 minute runtime , there was zero other indication that you were seeing anything other than an ( admittedly shitty ) documentary .\nNot until the end credits , with its clear listing of actors in the \u201c scripted story \u201d segments , do they come close to admitting what you 've been watching that whole time .\nGood thing that American audiences always closely monitor TV credits , right ?\nBigfoot Captured takes the form of a fake , feature-length documentary about a researcher traveling the globe in hopes of finding this cryptozoological specimen .\nThis main character , as if this needs to be said , is a fictional person played by an actor .\nThe result : Scenes of actors playing researchers , interviewing other actors playing witnesses .\nIt 's essentially a Russian nesting doll of bullshit .\nNone of this is new , and has been the common practice in all the other fictional documentaries such as Mermaids : The Body Found , where you can literally look up the actors ' names on IMDB .\nWhere Bigfoot Captured diverges , though , is in the rather insidious use of actual people alongside the fake characters .\nIdaho State University professor Jeffrey Meldrum , for instance , is extensively interviewed and featured ; a real university professor and expert in human locomotion who has also studied Sasquatch reports .\nI found myself wondering : Can this man possibly have known what kind of TV program Bigfoot Captured was actually going to be ?\nDid they lie to him , making him think they were conducting an actual documentary about bigfoot sightings ?\nOr did they simply pay this guy , a college professor , enough to participate in a fake documentary knowing full well that it was going to end with five minutes of a CGI Sasquatch in a cage ?\nBecause if it 's the latter , then that is a massive betrayal of a professor 's charge to educate .\nIf Dr. Jeffrey Meldrum knew what kind of program Bigfoot Captured was , then he should be summarily fired from his teaching position for failing an educator 's version of the Hippocratic Oath .\nThis is a man who has spoken out against Bigfoot hoaxers in the past , and yet here he now is participating happily in a fake documentary , purposely spreading misinformation .\nI wonder if I could get him on the phone to explain himself if I called Idaho State University often enough .\nUPDATE : Dr. Meldrum has posted to Facebook essentially denouncing the production .\nIt seems clear he had no idea what he was getting into .\nHilarious .\nThis style of BS programming has now been refined into a science of its own .\nThe narrative elements are careful in going out of their way to not \u201c tell you what to believe , \u201d or at least not directly .\nInstead , they present you with mounds of fake evidence and rely on the impressionable viewer to \u201c come to their own conclusion. \u201d Ignorant , close-minded skeptic characters are used as straw men to shoot down any potential arguments before they 're raised .\nIt all taps into the same desire that fuels conspiracy theorists in general\u2014the desire to be a possessor of secret knowledge , to feel intelligent .\nThe History Channel execs understand that the more ignorant portions of their audience desperately want to feel like they belong to a fraternity of people with knowledge that \u201c they \u201d ( whoever the hell 'they ' are in this scenario ) DO N'T WANT YOU TO KNOW .\nPerhaps they already believe these sorts of things\u2014in that case , Bigfoot Captured simply triggers their confirmation bias .\nConsider this M\u00f6bius strip of hypocrisy .\nIn order to be on History Channel in the first place , the program has to make some sort of claim toward veracity\u2014hence , the fake documentary format .\nSimultaneously , in order to not be called charlatans , the official position of History Channel has to be \u201c people are just watching to be entertained , no one is taking this seriously. \u201d SIMULTANEOUSLY , the show has to be believable enough to still fool people , because if it did n't , no one would be watching .\nJust writing that makes my brain want to gnaw its way out of my skull , seeking sweet freedom .\nIt all culminates in sequences that are , thankfully , so unabashedly ridiculous and SyFy Original Movie-esque that they hopefully would have dissuaded at least some of the potentially duped viewers from believing what they 're seeing .\nI 'd like to believe that the sequences of researchers being chased through the woods , pelted with boulders and inserted into what almost feels like a Sasquatch snuff film would be enough to make this clear , but then I just scroll up and re-read those earlier tweets .\nNow , the fact that the special also pissed off some Sasquatch true believers , I do n't even know how to feel about that .\nWelcome \u2026 ummm , allies ?\nI think ?\nNever pull some shit like this again , very bad move .\nYou just alienated thousands of believers .\nGood job !\n# BigfootCaptured \u2014 cory ( @ rundiggity ) November 10 , 2015 # bigfootcaptured @ history The really sad part is this show will hurt and discredit the legitimate Bigfoot research !\n\u2014 Ty Curtis

been completely tapped out , so last-minute scenes were added in the 30 minutes before all the video equipment was repossessed .\nI shit you not , the phrase \u201c I don \u2019 t think you locked the

Said Kouachi , 34 , reportedly threatened as they stole food and gas .\nPolice think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods .\nTies to Islamist extremists As the suspects moved ,

that crashed .\nGermanwings is a low-cost airline owned by the Lufthansa Group .\nHide Caption 26 of 26 Germanwings started in 2002 and was taken over by Lufthansa seven years later as its low-cost airline , handling an increasing number of midrange flights around Europe .\nIt was forced to cancel some flights Tuesday because there were crews that did n't want to fly upon hearing news of the crash .\nMountainous terrain The valley where the plane went down is long and snow-covered , and access is difficult , said the mayor of the nearby town of Barcelonnette , Pierre Martin-Charpenel .\nIt was well populated in the 19th century but there are almost no people living there now , he said .\nIt 's an out-of-the-way place with magnificent scenery , he said .\nThe mountainous terrain where the Germanwings jet went down is difficult to access .\nThe sports hall of a local school has been freed up to take in bodies of the victims of the plane crash , said Sandrine Julien from the town hall of Seyne-les-Alpes village .\nSeyne-les-Alpes is about 10 kilometers from the crash site .\nMountain guide Yvan Theaudin told BFMTV the crash was in the area of the Massif des Trois Eveches , where there are peaks of nearly 3,000 meters ( 1.9 miles ) .\nIt 's very snowy in the area and the weather is worsening , he said , which could complicate search and rescue efforts .\nResponders may have to use skis to reach the crash site on the ground , he said .\nSandrine Boisse , president of the tourism office at the Pra Loup ski resort , said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened .\n`` It was about 11 ( a.m. ) here .\nI was outside the garage , and we heard a strange noise , and at first we thought it was an avalanche , '' she said .\n`` Something was wrong .\n... We did n't know what . ''\nA mountain guide who heard a plane fly at alarmingly low altitude shortly before the crash , Michel Suhubiette , said helicopters may be the only way to get to the crash site .\nPlane plummeted for eight minutes According to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration , just under 16 % of aviation accidents occur during the cruise portion of a flight -- meaning after the climb and before descent .\nAccidents are more common during takeoff and landing .\n16 % of accidents are while flight cruises ; vast majority are during takeoff , maneuvering , landing , per @ FAANews : pic.twitter.com/1hXtP3CH0n \u2014 Josh Levs ( @ JoshLevs ) March 24 , 2015 The twin-engine Airbus A320 , which entered service in 1988 , is generally considered among the most reliable aircraft , aviation analyst David Soucie said .\nThe captain of the crashed plane had flown for Germanwings for more than 10 years , and had more than 6,000 flight hours on this model of Airbus .\nThe plane itself dates to 1991 and was last checked in Dusseldorf on Monday , according to Winkelmann .\nSo what happened ?\nCNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said the plane 's speed is one clue .\nAccording to Germanwings , the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , and then dropped for eight minutes .\nThe plane lost contact with French radar at a height of approximately 6,000 feet .\nThen it crashed .\nThis could indicate that there was not a stall , but that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent , Schiavo said .\nHad there been an engine stall , the plane would have crashed in a matter of minutes , she said .\nThat small piece of information about the descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing , or that the plane was gliding with the pilot 's guidance , Schiavo said .\nA scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains , she said .\nMerkel : 'Think of the victims' The crash spurred officials in several countries to offer their condolences and pledge solidarity and cooperation to help those affected and determine what happened .\n`` Our thoughts and our prayers are with our friends in Europe , especially the people of Germany and Spain , following the terrible airplane crash in France , '' U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters .\n`` It 's particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children , some of them infants . ''\nGermany 's Merkel said she was sending two ministers to France on Tuesday and would travel to the crash site on Wednesday to see it for herself .\n`` We have to think of the victims and their families and their friends , '' she said .\nGerman Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the German government had set up a crisis center in response to the `` terrible news '' and was in close contact with the French authorities .\n`` In these difficult hours , our thoughts are with those who have to fear that their close ones are among the passengers and crew , '' he said ."}

''\nIt 's not certain if this is exactly how things went down , or if the quote was fabricated .\nAccording to her sister , Beuford was filming an Instagram video and hoped to get famous for her 64-inch butt .\nShe had gotten the implants from an unlicensed clinic that is now under investigation .\nDoctors say Beuford will require surgery , as the exploding implants caused some serious damage to her rectum , colon , and lower intestines .\nThe moral of this story ?\nDo n't get illegal butt injections .\nGet famous on Instagram by posting pictures of your cat or something instead .\nUpdate 7/15 , 12 : 45 p.m. : It turns out this story was entirely made up , and it 's virtually impossible to have anything like this happen .\nAccording to Douglas Steinbrech , a board certified plastic surgeon , `` Implants do n't pop .\nThey stay in position .\nIt 's not like a balloon .\nIf she had a balloon filled with some kind of saline , even if it popped , the fluid still stays there and then it takes hours for the fluid to resorb .\nIt 's not like you 'd have that immediate deflation . ''\nAnd even if an untrained , uncertified back-alley `` surgeon '' did manage to put a balloon into someone 's body , it would have to somehow break the skin to deflate dramatically .\nIn fact , once implants are in and healed up , Dr. Steinbrech says you 'll have full range of movement and even rigorous exercise should n't impact the implant .\nDealing in complete hypotheticals , Dr. Steinbrech says , `` The only way that that could be is if someone took breast sizers , which is basically a balloon that we blow up with saline or air just to see how big the implant is .\nThat could rupture , but it would be an air pocket and that would take some time for that to be resorbed .\nIf the implant eroded by the anus and eroded through the skin and the air pocket popped , it could go through the colon and come out like gas . ''\nSo a very specific ( and borderline impossible ) series of circumstances could cause someone to essentially fart their implant out .\nBut the short answer is still no .\n`` I 've seen everything , '' says Dr. Steinbrech about implants .\n`` And I have yet to see a balloon that 's blown up with air . ''\nStill , getting implants from someone who is n't board-certified can be incredibly dangerous and even deadly .\n`` Some places will inject things .\nI 've seen patients going to a nail salon and getting tile caulking .\nThat can cause problems , and if it gets into the arteries or veins , it can cause a deadly and immediate emboli , '' says Dr. Steinbrech .\nSo although this story is , at best , implausible , it 's still a very bad idea to go anywhere other than a board-certified surgeon for your butt implants .\nFollow Frank on Twitter ."}

'\nBroke her silence : Jessa Duggar , pictured with husband Ben Seewald , shared verses from the bible about sin and forgiveness in the wake of brother Josh confessed to adultery and viewing of online porn Biblical teaching : Jessa posted this photo on her Instagram account of a copy of the New Testament open at the First Epistle Of John with several verses underlined 'But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanest us from all sin . '\nThe passage continues : 'If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .\nIf we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness . '\nIt 's unclear if the verses are meant to show forgiveness for Josh now he has owned up to his sins or an admonition to him for his deception and untruthfulness to his wife Anna and the wider Duggar family .\n'Biggest hypocrite ever ' : Josh , 27 , admitted he cheated on his wife Anna throughout their seven year marriage and while he worked for a conservative Christian lobby group focused on family values in Washington , D.C .\nDefending : Jessa , 22 , appeared on Fox News in June to talk about the revelation that when she was a child , Josh had molested her and several other underage girls Back in June , Jessa vigorously defended Josh when she appeared on Fox News with her older sister Jill Duggar Dillard in the wake of the revelation he had molested five young girls , including his sisters , when he was a teenager .\nJessa described his inappropriate touching of her when she was about nine as 'mild ' and a result of 'bad choices . '\nOn Thursday , Josh , whose fourth child with Anna was born just one month ago , admitted to cheating on his wife over the course of their marriage after he was named as one of 37 million cheating spouses alleged to have Ashley Madison accounts .\nForgiving : Jessa and her sister Jill made excuses for their brother 's behavior , calling the touching 'mild , ' and told host Megyn Kelly they had forgiven him for what he did In the original statement he released after his use of the website was revealed , the 27-year-old said : ' I have been the biggest hypocrite ever . '\n'While espousing faith and family values , I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the internet and this became a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife . '\nHe went on : ' I am so ashamed of the double life that I have been living and am grieved for the hurt , pain and disgrace my sin has caused my wife and family , and most of all Jesus and all those who profess faith in Him . '\nHowever he later changed his statement in an attempt to erase his admission of a porn addiction .\nNewest arrival : Just four weeks ago , Josh welcomed his fourth child with Anna , baby Meredith Grace , seen here in a photo posted on the Duggar Family Official Facebook page Sorry : The eldest of the 19 Duggar kids , Josh now has four kids of his own .\nHe has apologized for the 'pain and disgrace my sin has caused my wife and family .

'\nFloyd preached that a husband and wife should maintain 'sexual contact ' and keep each other happy or risk an unsatisfied spouse looking elsewhere for gratification .\nSermon fodder : Jill Duggar tweeted a link to the live broadcast of Pastor Ronnie Floyd 's Sunday service at Cross Church in Springdale , Arkansas , where he preached on Sunday about sex , sin and forgiveness Floyd has previously shown support for the Duggars after Josh admitted to 'wrongdoing ' in his past , telling People that things like the molestation scandal 'have happened before and will happen again . '\nMeanwhile , the ongoing scandals caused by Josh 's action are casting a long shadow over Jessa 's first year of marriage and birth of her first child due on November 1 , her wedding anniversary .\nWhen her sister Jill gave birth to son Israel in April , she got her own TLC reality special .\nBut now , instead of being the center of attention and the focus of a reality show , as she had anticipated , she finds herself dealing with the ongoing fallout of her brother 's actions including the cancellation of 19 Kids And Counting .\n'She was in such a joyous moment in her life .\nInstead the show is n't there to chronicle this happy time , ' an unnamed source told People last week .\n'So much has changed for Jessa compared to what Jill experienced and it ca n't be changed back .\nAnd that 's sad for her .

{"label": true, "txt": "Did the National Cancer Institute \u2018 Finally Admit \u2019 That Marijuana Kills Cancer ? Advertisment : Claim : The National Cancer Institute has `` admitted '' that `` cannabis kills cancer . ''\nRating : About this rating False An August 2015 article published on the website PoliticusUSA contains the claim that an update to an National Institutes of Health document included a \u201c quiet \u201d admission that marijuana \u201c kills cancer \u201d : In just the past two weeks , the federal government and NIH have quietly confirmed that cannabis ( marijuana ) is very effective at killing cancer cells without harming healthy cells like radiation and chemotherapy .\nIn fact , on the NIH website devoted to the hideous disease , Cancer.gov , they published the truth about marijuana and its effectiveness at combatting [ sic ] cancer in a stunning reversal of over four decades of deliberate fear-mongering and propaganda portraying the common weed as dangerous ; all to satisfy the greed of the pharmaceutical industry , prison system , and law enforcement agencies at the local , state , and federal level .\nThat PoliticusUSA story has been , and continues to be , used as source material for variations on a \u201c Cancer Institute Finally Admits Marijuana Kills Cancer \u201d clickbait article that is cloned on a variety of low-rent websites .\nThe \u201c report \u201d in question is the NCI \u2019 s Physician Data Query ( PDQ ) on \u201c Cannabis and Cannabinoids. \u201d The National Cancer Institute maintains a database of peer-reviewed cancer research and publishes regular updates and summaries of this research in a product called known as a PDQ : The PDQ cancer information summaries are comprehensive , evidence-based summaries on topics that cover adult and pediatric cancer treatment , supportive and palliative care , screening , prevention , genetics , and integrative , alternative , and complementary therapies .\nPerplexingly , viral stories citing a 2015 update to this PDQ report as some sort of smoking gun do so for no clear reason .\nBoth the pre-update and post-update versions of the PDQ mentioned laboratory and animal studies that suggest potential anti-tumor effects from cannabis , and both versions include phrases that could be loosely ( and falsely ) interpreted as \u201c marijuana kills cancer. \u201d The earliest NIH cannabis PDQ archived on the Internet Archive is a 6 November 2014 version , and the sections related to the potential anti-tumor capabilities of cannabis is identical to the allegedly nefarious July 2015 update .\nBoth include this statement in the \u201c overview section \u201d : Cannabis has been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory ( see Question 6 ) The mysterious Question 6 ( the other item cited by these viral studies as proof of some sort of admission by the government ) provides information regarding a number of preclinical trials that have shown some promise at killing cancerous cells .\nThat list includes studies on mice , rats , and cell lines suggesting that some cannabinoids ( the group of medically relevant chemicals in cannabis ) may be able to selectively kill cancerous cells \u2014 including those found in colon , liver , and breast cancers .\nThat list was also not modified in any way between 2014 and mid-2018 , save for the addition of one new clinical review added to the PDQ in 2017 .\nSince the addition of that study occurred after PoliticusUSA published their article , their assertion that the PDQ was changed in a way that could be interpreted as a quiet \u201c admission \u201d of anything regarding anti-tumor potential in July 2015 is false .\nThe PDQ does reference studies that suggest a possible medical role for cannabis in cancer treatment , but to claim that these changes were added \u201c quietly \u201d in 2015 is complete fiction .\nEqually made up is the claim that the studies referenced in the PDQ \u201c prove \u201d that cannabis \u201c kills \u201d cancer .\nThe studies referenced in the PDQ are small scale preclinical trials ( or reviews of such trials ) , and therefore they do not \u201c prove \u201d anything with regards to efficacy as a treatment for cancer in humans , which is a broad and diverse groups of diseases unlikely to be \u201c cured \u201d by a single chemical or group of chemicals .\nThe number of drugs or treatments that have demonstrated preclinical potential only to be rejected after further study is prodigious : The organization Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America estimates that only 5 in 5,000 compounds that enter preclinical testing make it to human testing , and only 1 of those 5 may be safe and effective enough to reach pharmacy shelves .\nA major hurdle preventing human research on cannabis is that the United States government controversially considers it a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substance Act , meaning that the official position is that it has \u201c no currently accepted medical use , \u201d which limits research into its possible medical value .\nWhile the anti-tumor studies cited in the NCI PDQ could be part of a broader argument to remove marijuana from that Schedule 1 classification , they do not provide clear evidence that cannabis can be a viable cancer treatment .\nFurther , a PDQ report , which are merely reviews of scientific studies regularly updated by scientists at the NIH , does not have any bearing on the United States Government \u2019 s official view toward cannabis , and is wholly independent of any regulatory bodies or legal or political decision making groups : PDQ is a service of the NCI .\nThe NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .\nNIH is the federal government \u2019 s center of biomedical research .\nThe PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature .\nThey are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH .\nBecause the article making the claim that the NCI \u201c admitted \u201d that \u201c cannabis kills cancer \u201d uses information from a document that has no legal bearing on federal drug policy , and because that information does not in any way \u201c prove \u201d that cannabis could be a viable treatment for cancer , we rank this claim as false ."}

''\nMonis ran a website which was taken down shortly after he was named as the gunman in the hostage situation , Sky News reports .\nIn a letter posted to the website , which he signed Sheikh Haron , he accused Australia , Britain and the U.S. of `` oppression and terrorism '' and posted images of dead children .\nMonis also reportedly called for non-violent activism , writing that `` Islam is the religion of peace and a Muslim should be a peace activist . ''\nAs night descended on Sydney , the lights inside the shop went off , but it was unclear if that was by the suspected jihadist 's choice or if the police made the cafe go dark as a negotiating tactic .\nEarlier , the gunman appeared to be rotating frightened hostages in front of the window , holding up the black Islamist flag `` Shahada '' flag , an emblem of Jabhat al-Nusra , the Al Qaeda-linked terror group fighting - sometimes with , sometimes against - Islamic State in Syria .\nThe gunman was reportedly relaying threats and demands through two hostages , and claimed to have planted two bombs inside the cafe and two others elsewhere in Sydney 's central business district .\nLate Monday , Abbott released a pre-recorded statement calling the attack `` very disturbing '' and `` profoundly shocking .

{"label": true, "txt": "Kentucky clerk defies Supreme Court on same-sex marriage and could be held in contemptWhen Kim Davis ran her election campaign to replace her mother as Rowan County Clerk in Kentucky , she often argued that the public needed a seamless transition because services including marriage licenses \u201c can not stop or slow down. \u201d Davis was narrowly elected in 2014 to the top job in the office where she had worked for more than 25 years , rising to become her mom \u2019 s principal deputy .\nOn Tuesday , Davis derailed those services at the clerk \u2019 s office in Morehead , Ky. , by refusing to issue marriage licenses to all couples -- gay and straight -- because her religious beliefs prohibit same-sex marriage .\nDuring a chaotic morning she argued that God gave her the authority to defy even the nation \u2019 s highest court , which refused to get involved in the current case after it upheld gay marriage in June .\n\u201c To issue a marriage license which conflicts with God \u2019 s definition of marriage , with my name affixed to the certificate , would violate my conscience , \u201d she said in a prepared statement issued through her attorneys , the Liberty Counsel , based in Orlando , Fla. \u201c It is not a light issue for me .\nIt is a heaven or hell decision. \u201d Advertisement A federal judge has set a Thursday hearing to decide whether Davis and her top aides should be held in contempt of court to force them to issue marriage licenses .\nDavis could be personally fined or even face jail , though the plaintiffs say they just want their marriage license .\nThe battle has echoes from the days of the African American civil rights struggles of the 1960s when Southern officials refused to follow court rulings on integration .\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on June 26 that same-sex marriage was a constitutional right , most people thought the issue was resolved .\nAnd in most places , it was , except in a handful of counties in Texas , Alabama and Kentucky , where local officials chose to stop issuing all marriage licenses to avoid granting licenses to same-sex couples .\nLawsuits were filed in several of the states , including against Davis , who stopped issuing licenses days after the Supreme Court decision .\nTwo gay couples and two straight couples sued her , arguing that because she was an elected official she was required to issue the documents despite her religious beliefs .\nDavis claims she is protected by the state \u2019 s version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , designed to protect religious expression .\nFederal District Judge David L. Bunning disagreed , ruling against the clerk .\nLast week , the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Bunning .\n\u201c It can not be defensibly argued that the holder of the Rowan County Clerk \u2019 s office , apart from who personally occupies that office , may decline to act in conformity with the United States Constitution as interpreted by a dispositive holding of the United States Supreme Court , \u201d the appeals court said .\nOn Monday , the Supreme Court in a one-line order rejected Davis \u2019 appeal , ending the clerk \u2019 s legal fight .\nIt was the first time the court had to deal with a gay marriage issue since its June ruling .\nCarl Tobias , a law professor at the University of Richmond who has followed the same-sex marriage issue , said that although a number of clerks around the country say they are uncomfortable issuing licenses , the Rowan County case is the only one to have advanced so far in the courts .\n\u201c My reading is that the Supreme Court was pretty clear in late June about the notion of marriage equality , \u201d he said .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think the religious freedom argument is that strong in this situation. \u201d The high court \u2019 s action also set the scene for Tuesday \u2019 s confrontation in Morehead , where Davis turned away several gay and lesbian couples who sought marriage licenses .\nIt was the third time that David Moore and David Ermold had sought a license from Davis .\nIn televised video of their encounter , Davis told the couple to leave .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not leaving until we have a license , \u201d Ermold responded .\n\u201c Then you \u2019 re going to have a long day , \u201d Davis replied .\nDavis then retreated into her inner office and closed the blinds , seeking shelter from media cameras and rival demonstrations .\n\u201c Praise the Lord ! \u201d her supporters shouted .\n\u201c Stand your ground ! \u201d Other activists yelled , \u201c Do your job ! \u201d The mainly rural county , about 60 miles east of Lexington , has about 23,000 residents .\nDavis \u2019 mother served as county clerk for 37 years and her son also works in the clerk \u2019 s office .\n\u201c I love my job and the people of Rowan County , \u201d Davis stated .\n\u201c I have never lived any place other than Rowan County .\nSome people have said I should resign , but I have done my job well. \u201d Davis \u2019 husband , Joe , told reporters that his wife has received death threats .\nHe said he believed in the 2nd Amendment and was not afraid : \u201c I \u2019 m an old redneck hillbilly , that \u2019 s all I \u2019 ve got to say .\nDon \u2019 t come knocking on my door. \u201d He pointed to the gay rights protesters gathered outside and said : \u201c They want us to accept their beliefs and their ways .\nBut they won \u2019 t accept our beliefs and our ways. \u201d Davis was elected as a Democrat and has been supported by others including Casey County Clerk Casey Davis , who is riding his bicycle across the state in support of his fellow officeholder .\nHis county is not issuing any marriage license either to avoid the same-sex marrraige issue , and he wants a special session of the Kentucky Legislature to deal with the whole issue .\n\u201c Kim Davis is my spiritual sister , \u201d he said , breathing heavily , in a telephone interview from near Elizabethtown , Ky. \u201c I just climbed a real tall hill in Kentucky to help raise awareness about what is happening to Kim Davis , \u201d he said .\n\u201c She is a lady and not deserving of going to jail or being fined .\nAll she is trying to do is to live her life as a Christian and that should be her right. \u201d ALSO : U.S. stocks plummet ; Dow sinks below correction threshold Video shows deputies shooting San Antonio man whose hands were raised Northern Illinois police officer is shot and killed"}

, federal law does not prohibit tissue donations and allows fetal tissue donation \u2014 either from induced abortion , spontaneous miscarriage or stillbirth \u2014 with \u201c reasonable payments \u201d for the \u201c transportation , implantation , processing , preservation , quality control or storage of human fetal tissue. \u201d State laws governing organ donation , including from aborted babies , vary from state to state.The video only shows approximately nine minutes out of a nearly three-hour conversation .\nThe full transcript accompanying the video gives the whole picture , and , there , Nucatola stated that the goal of procuring fetal tissue at Planned Parenthood facilities \u201c is to give patients the option without impacting our bottom line. \u201d She said affiliates were looking to \u201c break even \u201d and explained that the service \u201c should not be seen as a new revenue stream , because that \u2019 s not what it is. \u201d \u201c [ Affiliates ] want to come to a number that doesn \u2019 t look like they \u2019 re making money .\nThey want to come to a number that looks like it is a reasonable number for the effort that is allotted on their part , \u201d she said .\nNucatola added that PPFA affiliates are interested in the tissue-donation service because of the need to dispose of fetal tissue , since they generally pay a company , such as Stericycle , to dispose of biological material .\nAt the same time , she said , it offers patients an opportunity to contribute to scientific research .\n\u201c At the end of the day , it is all just sitting there ; it \u2019 s all just going to be wasted otherwise .\nThat \u2019 s what it is : It \u2019 s a waste .\nIt \u2019 s a complete and total waste , \u201d she said .\nWhile Nucatola in the video appears to discount a profit motive , StemExpress , one of the recipients of fetal material from Planned Parenthood mentioned in the exchange , sells vials of fetal liver cells from anywhere between $ 488 and $ 24,250 .\nHowever , StemExpress marketed its program on its literature and website as \u201c financially profitable \u201d to participating clinics , and it carried an endorsement from Dr. Dorothy Furgerson of Planned Parenthood Mar Monte .\nA representative of StemExpress informed the Register on July 14 that the company is aware of the video and will be following up with a response .\nHowever , the Register received no reply to its follow-up calls and later found the company \u2019 s website temporarily shut down for \u201c maintenance. \u201d Planned Parenthood Responds Planned Parenthood responded by stating that the undercover video was \u201c heavily edited \u201d and \u201c falsely portrays Planned Parenthood \u2019 s participation in tissue-donation programs that support lifesaving scientific research. \u201d \u201c At several of our health centers , we help patients who want to donate tissue for scientific research , and we do this just like every other high-quality health-care provider does \u2014 with full , appropriate consent from patients and under the highest ethical and legal standards , \u201d said Eric Ferraro , PPFA \u2019 s vice president of communications , in a statement .\n\u201c There is no financial benefit for tissue donation for either the patient or Planned Parenthood .\nIn some instances , actual costs , such as the cost to transport tissue to leading research centers , are reimbursed , which is standard across the medical field. \u201d But Casey Maddox , senior counsel with the public interest firm Alliance Defending Freedom , said it appears that \u201c Planned Parenthood is carefully skirting this law , if not violating it. \u201d Maddox said the law allows for donations of tissue and reasonable fees , such as payments covering transportation , adding there is a line between a \u201c reasonable fee \u201d and \u201c making a profit. \u201d Where that line is may be difficult to pin down .\nA federal investigation into a company called Opening Lines , which sold fetal body parts obtained from abortion centers , closed in 2008 without any charges , due to the lack of evidence that the proprietor was turning a profit .\nIn that case , the company had charged as much as $ 999 for a brain of a late-term aborted baby .\nIn response , pro-life congressmen at the time had called for a total ban on the sale of aborted fetal tissue .\nBy comparison , the Planned Parenthood medical director in the CMP video suggested a price of $ 30- $ 100 per \u201c specimen. \u201d But Maddox also pointed out two problems : The video shows there may be violations of the federal partial-birth abortion ban .\nBut he said a less obvious violation is the law prohibits changing the abortion procedure in order to procure tissue for research .\nHe pointed to the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act , which stipulates \u201c no alteration of the timing , method or procedures used to terminate the pregnancy was made solely for the purposes of obtaining the tissue. \u201d \u201c The video explicitly describes how they are changing the abortion in order to provide good tissue samples , \u201d he said .\nCalls for Action The revelations have raised renewed support for banning late-term abortion based on fetal pain and prompted other calls for action .\nLouisiana Gov .\nBobby Jindal , a candidate in the Republican presidential primary , announced July 14 he was ordering a state investigation into the \u201c shocking and gruesome \u201d allegations .\nHe noted a Planned Parenthood affiliate is seeking to open an abortion center in New Orleans .\n\u201c I have instructed Louisiana \u2019 s Department of Health and Hospitals [ DHH ] to conduct an immediate investigation into this alleged evil and illegal activity and to not issue any licenses until this investigation is complete , \u201d he said .\nOther pro-life groups called on Congress to revoke all federal funding of Planned Parenthood .\nCharmaine Yoest , president of Americans United for Life , called for Congress to use its subpoena power \u201c to determine how Planned Parenthood is using taxpayer dollars and whether they are violating the federal prohibition on [ the ] sale of human body parts. \u201d \u201c This video provides a shocking reality check about the grisly , inhumane business model of Planned Parenthood , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Under Cecile Richards \u2019 leadership , breast screenings are down , abortions are up , and profits are up , as even the bodies of the unborn become something else for her to sell. \u201d Peter Jesserer Smith is the Register \u2019 s Washington correspondent .\nCatholic News Agency contributed to this report ."}

''\nEvgeny Morozov , who was a Yahoo fellow at the time , called it \u201c slacktivism , \u201d a \u201c harmless activism \u201d that \u201c was n't very productive. \u201d Among other critiques , Morozov voiced two important questions in a larger debate over the value of collective action online .\nFirst , he argued that social-media solidarity has an unknown effect toward political change , perhaps even siphoning energy away from more effective action .\nSecondly , Morozov downplayed the cost and risk of that participation .\nBut unlike Westerners showing solidarity for Iranians on Twitter , gender equality in the U.S. involves changes in social relations alongside political changes .\nChanging one \u2019 s profile image in support of marriage equality in America carries immediate risks and costs , from \u201c a quarrel with one \u2019 s otherwise-thinking friends\u2014to the life-threatening , \u201d as State and Adamic explain in their research .\nIndeed , it 's hard to look at the compilation of coming-out videos posted by YouTube on Friday and dismiss online activity as inconsequential .\nThe \u201c slacktivism \u201d of changing a profile image matters in part because of the personal risks it may entail , and in part because it may contribute to changes in the social acceptance of LGBTQ people .\nWhile some might argue a rainbow-colored profile is a lazy way of showing support , it could be an act of great courage for the person changing their profile .\nWhat leads people to participate in costly , risky social change , anyway ?\nAnd might people be more likely to get involved if their friends also participate ?\nThat 's the question asked by Stanford sociologist Doug McAdam in his research on Freedom Summer , a 1964 civil-rights action that placed over 700 college students in black families \u2019 homes in Mississippi to register black voters .\nOver 10 weeks , there were three murders , \u201c 52 serious beatings , 250 arrests , and 13 black churches burned to the ground. \u201d When McAdam found an archive of 1,086 Freedom Summer volunteer application forms , including lists of volunteers ' most trusted friends , he had a unique opportunity to test the factors associated with costly , risky social change .\nIn a statistical model , McAdam found that the greatest predictors of involvement in Freedom Summer were \u201c ( a ) greater number of organizational affiliations , ( b ) higher levels of prior civil rights activity , and ( c ) stronger and more extensive ties to other participants. \u201d In other words , among those who applied and were accepted , people with more participating friends were more likely to go through with their activism , when controlling for other factors .\nAnd when Facebook \u2019 s researchers studied how support for marriage equality spread on their social network , they cited McAdam \u2019 s research and Freedom Summer as an important inspiration .\nAlthough McAdam later studied network structure , The Freedom Summer data couldn \u2019 t answer the question of whether seeing others take action prompts a person to get involved .\nBut in March 2013 , when millions of Facebook users changed their profile , Facebook \u2019 s researchers saw it as a chance to evaluate how participation spreads .\nIn their study , State and Adamic asked the question : how many times do you need to see a friend change their profile picture before deciding to change your own ?\nThey set up two competing hypotheses .\nThe first possibility was that profile changes spread like funny pictures and other online memes , falling off in influence as more people share them .\nThe second possibility they considered was that people need to see others make the change before they follow suit , that \u201c multiple exposures are most effective in determining the adoption of ... [ costly ] behaviors. \u201d To test these competing hypotheses and develop a new model for how solidarity spreads from person to person , Facebook \u2019 s researchers classified profile images from over 3 million users in March 2013 , along with 106 million users who were exposed to those changed profiles .\nNext , they predicted the likelihood of someone changing their profile to an equality image , depending on how many friends they had seen make the change .\nState and Adamic found that while someone \u2019 s likelihood to participate varied based on several factors\u2014a person \u2019 s political affiliations , religion , and age , for example\u2014the likelihood to change one \u2019 s profile image was greater with more exposures to changes by friends .\nAccording to State and Adamic , this likelihood increased \u201c only for the first six exposures. \u201d After the sixth exposure , the relationship \u201c becomes virtually flat . \u201d"}

by the names Mohammad Hassan Manteghi and Manteghi Boroujerdi , was infamously involved in sending \u2018 grossly offensive \u2019 letters to parents and relatives of Australian victims of terrorism and troops killed in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2009 .\nHe unsuccessfully challenged the conviction in the high court last year .\nThe Iranian-born man , who apparently converted from Shia Islam to Sunni only last week , has also been accused of being an accessory in the killing of his ex-wife , a charge for which he remains on bail .\nHe told ABC News in 2001 that he fled Australia five years earlier after falling foul of the Iranian regime , which he said had placed his wife and children under house arrest .\n\u2018 I can say they are hostage , \u2019 he said at the time .\nMan Haron Monis pictured in Sydney in April 2011 .\nPhotograph : Dean Lewins/epa/corbis A fringe figure in Australia \u2019 s Muslim community , Monis has been spurned by Shia leaders , who have reportedly

Muslims as \u2018 rejectionists \u2019 .\nA rambling October letter he penned to the Muslim community rejected the \u2018 new religion \u2019 of moderate Islam .\n\u2018 This pen is my gun and these

{"label": true, "txt": "North Korean ghost boats , in deadly hunt for fish , wash up in JapanBy Ju-min Park and Kaori Kaneko SEOUL/TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Fishing boats carrying decomposed corpses have washed ashore in Japan in recent weeks , leading to speculation they are rickety North Korean vessels that have strayed dangerously far from port under the impoverished nation 's push to boost its catch .\nThere has been no mention from secretive North Korea of any missing boats , but its leader , Kim Jong Un , has put a high priority on fishing as a way of earning foreign currency and providing a sustainable food source that is not reliant on harvests and weather .\nThe Japanese coast guard and police reported 12 incidents of wrecked wooden boats , including some that were in pieces , on the country 's shores and waters since October , containing 22 dead bodies , including five skulls .\nJapanese authorities declined to comment on the origins of the boats or the possible identities of the dead , but a hand-written sign identified one boat as belonging to unit 325 of the North Korean army , according to footage from Japan 's NHK Television .\nTattered cloth was found aboard the vessel that appeared to come from the North Korean flag , the video showed .\nDefectors and experts say fishing boats under the command of the Korean People 's Army may have succumbed under pressure from Kim to catch more fish , drifting off course and ill-equipped for rough seas .\nTV images of some of the boats showed relatively large but otherwise primitive-looking motorized craft and the coast guard said they did not have GPS navigation systems .\nThose aboard could have died of starvation and exposure to the cold after getting lost .\nAlthough Japan 's Meteorological Agency said there was not unusually bad weather in the Sea of Japan this November , the waters are rougher at this time of year due to the onset of cold , northwesterly winds .\nOctober through February is also prime season for squid , sandfish and king crab off the east coast of the Korean peninsula , and it is not unusual that there would be high numbers of boats at sea , said Kim Do-hoon , a professor of fisheries science at Bukyong National University in Busan .\n`` Kim Jong Un has been promoting the fisheries , which could explain why there are more fishing boats going out , '' he said .\n`` But North Korean boats perform really poorly , with bad engines , risking lives to go far to catch more .\nSometimes they drift and fishermen starve to death , '' he said .\nDEADLY INCENTIVE SYSTEM Over the years , North Korean boats seeking the rich fishing grounds of the Sea of Japan have washed ashore in Japan as well as on the deserted beaches of the Russian Far East .\nNorth Koreans looking to defect , on the other hand , typically flee by land into China , or , less often , via coastal waters to neighboring South Korea .\nFishing is a vital industry in a country where millions can not find enough to eat .\nNorth Korea 's 1.2 million-strong army is heavily engaged in food production , including fishing .\n`` Some of the boats belong to Korean People 's Army fishery stations , possibly operating to catch sailfin sandfish , '' said An Chan-il , who served in the North 's army as a junior officer before defecting to South Korea in 1979 and now heads a private think tank on North Korea in Seoul .\n`` Kim Jong Un is pushing hard to produce more fish .\nSo these boats must have been stranded after overworking , '' he said .\nKim , North Korea 's young leader , has made boosting food production a priority for the isolated country since taking office after his father died in late 2011 , and recently visited a KPA fishing station on North Korea 's east coast , calling for the facility to be upgraded , the official KCNA news agency said .\n`` Modernization of the station will help it catch more fish , ( Kim ) said , adding : The station should be turned into an up-to-date fishery base which can be boasted of in the world , thus making our ongoing efforts produce good results for the service persons and civilians , '' the Nov 25 report said .\nLee So-yeon , a North Korean army defector who arrived in Seoul in 2008 , said fish products are a key export for North Korea 's army , which hires civilian fishermen to make money .\n`` North Korean army units and security agencies are running many businesses to earn foreign currency from mining gold to catching fish on the west and east coasts , '' said Lee .\nLee Jong-won , professor of international relations at Japan 's Waseda University , added : `` The North is introducing an incentive system for producers .\nFish is one of the main export products to China , which can be a way to get foreign currency\u2026There is a possibility this incentive system led people to take more risks .

{"label": true, "txt": "Toddlers Killed More Americans than Terrorists in 2015Advertisment : Claim : Toddlers killed more Americans than terrorists in 2015 .\nRating : About this rating True On 16 December 2015 the Facebook page `` Go Left Forever '' published the above-reproduced meme holding that in 2015 , toddlers were responsible for the deaths of more Americans than `` foreign terrorists . ''\nThe claim appeared widely in various forms of media , and its primary source being a 14 October 2015 Washington Post `` Wonkblog '' article that culled statistics from a manual search of news reports .\nA little kid finds a gun , fires it , and hurts or kills himself or someone else .\nThese cases rarely bubble up to the national level except when someone , like a parent , ends up dead ...\nBut cases like this happen a lot more frequently than you might think .\nAfter spending a few hours sifting through news reports , I 've found at least 43 instances this year of somebody being shot by a toddler 3 or younger .\nIn 31 of those 43 cases , a toddler found a gun and shot himself or herself .\nAs noted on the graph , the paper manually located instances in which a toddler ( defined by the author as `` [ three ] or younger '' ) killed someone , a task complicated by the lack of centralized records of shootings involving toddlers .\nThe author stated that the victims ( including toddlers themselves ) used in compiling the numbers were shot or killed , though that information was clearly broken down visually in the graph excerpted above .\nBy the Washington Post 's count , as of mid-October 2015 fifteen people had died at the hands of a toddler with a gun , and at least 28 more were injured ( including other toddlers ) .\nOne potentially mutable variable involves the definition of `` toddler . ''\nAs with our earlier article regarding the claim that more preschoolers were shot and killed than police officers , the definition of the term `` toddlers '' is not universal , although it is generally accepted to encompass children between the ages of one and three .\nOn 29 November 2015 , the Huffington Post published a follow-up article that possibly introduced more information ( an additional nine toddler-involved shootings occurred by their count , bringing the total from 43 to 52 as of that date ) .\nHuffington Post also introduced the contrast of terrorism victims to toddler victims : When that article was published on Oct 14th , there had only been 43 toddler shooting incidents .\nSince then , there have been 9 more , with an average of one toddler involved shooting a week < .\nYet , in this year 's only shooting involving Islamic terrorists in Chattanooga , Tennessee , five people died , with two additional people being injured .\nThat second article complicated the data .\nWho had been counted by Washington Post , and who had been counted by Huffington Post ?\nWould a similar manual search of records lead to double-counting ?\nWe searched news reports from 14 October 2015 forward , finding several `` toddler-involved shootings '' with a variety of outcomes .\nYoung children in Acworth and Jackson , Georgia found guns and shot themselves after the publication of the Washington Postpiece ( neither survived ) ; a boy in Rock Hill , South Carolina shot his grandmother but did not kill her ; two-year-old Abigail Newman was shot in the neck and killed in North Carolina in late October ; and a three-year-old was shot and killed by his six-year-old brother in Chicago .\nAnother data complication showed up in the Huffington Post 's presentation .\nTheir article emphasized a parallel with terrorism-related deaths and compared toddler-involved shootings with the July 2015 Chattanooga mass shooting that killed six ( including the gunman ) .\nThe deceased suspect in that mass shooting was in fact an American citizen ( born in Kuwait ) so whether an individual who was by all accounts a U.S. citizen counts as an `` Islamic terrorist '' is a factor of some debate that affects the compilation of data .\nHuffington Post described the Chattanooga shooting as `` the only '' incident involving `` Islamic terrorists '' in the United States in 2015 .\nAt the time , that description was partly true : Suspect Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez was American but also a Muslim , and he was believed to be the sole shooter ( not one of more `` terrorists . '' )\nAs our earlier article indicated , law enforcement agents considered the incident under investigation and incomplete as of mid-November 2015 : On 13 November 2015 , the Associated Press reported that investigators remained circumspect about Abdulazeez 's motive : `` We 're still trying to make sure we understand Abdulazeez , his motivations and associations , in a really good way , '' FBI Director James Comey told reporters during a visit to Nashville 's FBI field office on Friday .\nComey said he understands the public interest in the shooting , but he did not know whether there would ever be a public report on it .\n`` Sometimes the way we investigate requires us to keep information secret .\nThat 's a good thing .\nWe do n't want to smear people , '' he said .\nThus , by November 2015 the relative body counts of foreign terrorists to toddlers were by all accounts murky and dependent on individual definitions of several terms .\nOn 2 December 2015 , a mass shooting in San Bernardino left 14 civilians and two attackers dead .\nBy the time the meme reproduced at the top of this page was published on 15 December 2015 , the shooting was still considered an active investigation and details remained fluid .\nInitially , investigators adamantly asserted the motives for the shooting were unclear .\nFederal law enforcement agents took over the investigation within a few days , and at that point mentions of `` self-radicalization '' and `` ISIS sympathizing '' officially entered media reports .\nBy 16 December 2015 , some of those initial reports were walked back : The Blaze reported that there was no evidence the shooters were involved in a `` terror cell . ''\nWikipedia , which has served as a compendium of multiple reports , classified the incident as `` terrorism , mass shooting , [ and ] workplace shooting . ''\nWhat 's more , on 16 December 2015 The Hill reported that initial claims one of the shooters publicly supported `` jihad '' on Facebook had been inaccurate : The FBI said that suspected San Bernardino , Calif. , shooters Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik did not express their support for jihad publicly on social media , potentially undercutting efforts to ramp up surveillance of foreign travelers \u2019 online presences .\nFBI Director James Comey told reporters that there was \u201c no evidence of a posting on social media by either of them '' to reflect that they had been radicalized .\nThe communications instead were \u201c direct , private messages , \u201d the FBI head said during a news conference in New York .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen some reporting on that and that \u2019 s a garble. \u201d FBI Director James B. Comey said at the time that although the investigation had shown that Farook and Malik were radicalized and possibly inspired by foreign terrorist organizations , there was no indication that the couple were directed by such a group or part of a broader cell or network .\nLike Abdulazeez , Malik and Farook were Muslims .\nBut also like Abdulazeez , Farook was American , born in Chicago .\nMalik was Pakistani and lived in Saudi Arabia before marrying Farook , but lived in the United States as a permanent resident .\nOn 17 December 2015 , we contacted Christopher Ingraham , the Washington Post journalist whose article inadvertently sparked all the comparison memes .\nIngraham confirmed that he continued compiling information on toddler-involved shootings after publishing his October 2015 article and provided us with updated data .\nNoting that `` in most cases , the toddlers are killing or injuring themselves , '' Ingraham counted 58 total toddler-involved shootings in 2015 as of 17 December of that year .\nIn 19 instances toddlers shot and killed themselves , and in two others toddlers shot and killed other individuals .\nThat brought the total of toddler-involved shooting deaths in the United States in 2015 to 21 .\nBy contrast , if we counted both the Chattanooga shootings and San Bernardino as instances of Islamic terrorism , that would mean 19 Americans were killed in instances of suspected , reported , or potential Islamic terrorism in 2015 .\nCounting American victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks brought that number up to 20 .\nEven using the broadest leeway in counting U.S. victims of `` Islamic terrorism '' leads to the same mathematical conclusion : More Americans were shot and killed by toddlers in 2015 than were killed by Islamic terrorists ."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Maya Vidon and Doug Stanglin USA TODAY PARIS \u2014 Heavily armed police mounted simultaneous attacks on two hostage-standoffs about 30 miles apart on Friday , killing two terror suspects holed up in a warehouse north of Paris and a gunman who had seized hostages at a kosher supermarket in the capital .\nFour people were killed when the supermarket gunman entered the store , Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said .\nSixteen hostages were freed , one from the warehouse and 15 others from the grocery .\nSeveral people \u2014 including two police officers \u2014 were reported wounded at the supermarket .\nPolice were still on the lookout for an associate of the terrorists , Hayat Boumeddiene , 26 , who police described as the common-law wife and accomplice of the supermarket gunman , Amedy Coulibaly , 32 .\nBoumeddiene 's whereabouts and link to the supermarket attack remain unknown , but she is considered armed and dangerous .\nFamily members of the slain terrorists are among several people who have been charged over the attacks , Molins said .\nHours after the sieges ended , al-Qaeda 's branch in Yemen said it had `` directed '' the Wednesday massacre at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo `` as revenge for the honor '' of Islam 's prophet , Mohammed , a member of AQAP in Yemen said in a statement to the Associated Press .\nThe weekly paper has published cartoons lampooning Mohammed .\nThe attack reiterated the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden 's warnings to the West about `` the consequences of the persistence in the blasphemy against Muslim sanctities , '' according to the statement .\nBut U.S. authorities said later they are reviewing the claim of responsibility , two U.S. officials told USA TODAY .\nIt was not immediately clear whether al-Qaeda actually directed and financed the attack or merely supported the gunmen , Said Kouachi and his younger brother , Cherif , said the officials , who are not authorized to comment publicly .\nThe Kouachis died Friday in the warehouse shootout with police .\nWitnesses had reported that as the masked gunmen fled the newspaper carnage , one shouted that al-Qaeda was responsible .\nOfficials also said Said Kouachi had traveled to Yemen sometime in 2011 and trained with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .\nHours before dying with his brother , Cherif Kouachi told French broadcaster BFMTV on Friday that he was financed by a network loyal to al-Awlaki .\nAbout the same time the AQAP statement was issued , one of the terror group 's top religious figures said in a speech posted to YouTube that France would face more violence if it did not stop fighting Islam , its symbols and Muslims in general .\n`` Some of the sons of France were disrespectful to the prophets of Allah , so a group from among the believing soldiers of Allah marched unto them , then they taught them respect and the limit of the freedom of expression , '' according to a translation from the terror-monitoring SITE Institute .\n`` Soldiers who love Allah and His messengers have come unto you , and they do not fear death but adore martyrdom in the cause of Allah .

''\nOne of two hostages killed was Katrina Dawson , 38 , a mother of three young children and a lawyer , or barrister as they are called in Australia .\nOfficials said she died of a heart attack en route to a hospital .\nShe had been having coffee with a colleague in the cafe when the gunman took hostages .\nThe other killed hostage was identified by Sky News as the manager of the Lindt Cafe , Tori Johnson , 34 .\n`` We are so proud of our beautiful boy Tori , gone from this earth but forever in our memories as the most amazing life partner , son and brother we could ever wish for , '' his family said in a statement .\n`` We 'd like to thank not only our friends and loved ones for their support , but the people of Sydney , Australia and those around the world for reaching out with their thoughts and prayers . ''\nA close friend of Johnson , Deborah Thomas , told USA TODAY that she learned of his death from Johnson 's father shortly after gunfire ended the siege .\nShe said he died trying to overcome the gunman and called him `` a kind , beautiful , gentle man . ''\n`` My understanding is that in the middle of the night , when the gunman was dozing , Tori went for the gun , '' Thomas said .\n`` I do n't know exactly what happened -- if it went off or the gunman shot him .\nI do know they tried to revive him . ''\n`` From a family and friend 's perspective , we take comfort knowing that Tori is hailed as one of the heroes , rather than as a victim , '' Thomas said .\nSydney Mayor Clover Moore told CNN that she understood the gunman shot one of the victims and `` that was the catalyst for the police going in .

''\nAn association of dozens of Australian Muslim groups issued a statement condemning the attack .\n`` We reject any attempt to take the innocent life of any human being , or to still fear or terror into their hearts , '' the statement said .\n`` We remind everyone that the Arabic inscription on the black flag is not representative of a political statement , but reaffirms a testimony of faith that has been misappropriated by misguided individuals that represent no one but themselves . ''\nThree people ran out of the cafe six hours into the crisis .\nAbout an hour later , two women wearing aprons with the Lindt chocolate logo fled the cafe into the arms of heavily armed police officers .\nKathryn Chee , who works at the cafe , told ABC she had planned to arrive at work early when her mother told her the news of the incident .\nShe said she saw pictures on TV of hostages with their hands against the windows .\n`` Straight away , there were three people that I knew ... my heart just sank , '' she said .\n'It 's just a little cafe , we have regular customers , people we know their orders \u2026 we 're already making their order before they get to the counter . ''\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reported that th e gunman forced hostages to call multiple news media outlets to outline his demands , and that the hostages also posted his demands on their social media accounts .\nThe standoff gripped downtown Sydney , shutting down government offices , public transit and schools as it dragged through the day .\nThe normally busy and crowded business district of the city was on virtual lockdown .\nAustralia raised its terror warning level in September in response to a domestic threat posed by supporters of the Islamic State group .\nAt the time , one man arrested during a series of raids in Sydney was charged with conspiring with an Islamic State leader in Syria to behead a random person in downtown Sydney .\nMeanwhile in Belgium on Monday , police detained three men after reports of a hostage taking in an apartment building in the western city of Ghent .\nNo one was injured in the incident .\nFederal police spokeswoman Annemie Serlippens excluded any political or terror motive .\nPolice , who blocked off a wide perimeter around the area , said it was still unclear whether they had taken any hostages .\nBacon reported from McLean , Va. ; Contributing : William M.

{"label": true, "txt": "Canada 's parliament attacked , soldier fatally shot nearbyOTTAWA ( Reuters ) - A gunman attacked Canada \u2019 s parliament on Wednesday , with gunfire erupting near where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking , and a soldier was fatally shot at a nearby war memorial , stunning the Canadian capital .\nThe gunman in the parliament building was shot dead , and Harper was safely removed in incidents that may have been linked to Islamic militants .\nWitness accounts indicated the man who shot dead the soldier guarding the National War Memorial in central Ottawa , went on to attack the parliament building minutes later .\nCanadian police said however they could not \u201c at this point \u201d confirm it was the same person .\nThe shootings followed an attack on two soldiers in Quebec on Monday carried out by a convert to Islam .\nTwo U.S. officials said U.S. agencies had been advised the dead gunman in Wednesday \u2019 s shootings was also a Canadian convert to Islam .\nWitnesses said a flurry of shots were fired after a gunman entered the parliament building , pursued by police .\nThe assault took place very near the room where Harper was meeting with members of his Conservative party , a government minister said .\n\u201c PM ( Harper ) was addressing caucus , then a huge boom , followed by rat-a-tat shots .\nWe all scattered .\nIt was clearly right outside our caucus door , \u201d Treasury Board Minister Tony Clement told Reuters .\nThe incident , shocking in Canada \u2019 s normally tranquil capital , began shortly before 10 a.m .\nET and was not over late in the afternoon .\nParliament and buildings in downtown remained on emergency lockdown at 6 p.m. Canadian police were investigating a man named as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau as a possible suspect in the shootings , a source familiar with the matter said .\nU.S. government sources said the suspect was born Michael Joseph Hall but later changed his legal family name to Zehaf-Bibeau .\nSecurity in Ottawa came under criticism after the gunman was able to run through the unlocked front door of the main parliament building .\nPolice said an operation was under way to make parliament safe .\n\u201c It caught us by surprise ...\nIf we had known that this was coming , we would have been able to disrupt it , \u201d Gilles Michaud , assistant commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , ( RCMP ) told a news conference .\nIt was unclear whether there was any connection between Wednesday \u2019 s shootings and an attack on Monday when a convert to Islam ran down two Canadian soldiers with his car , killing one , near Montreal , before being shot dead by police in the first fatal attack on Canadian soil tied to Islamic militants .\nNo group , Islamic or otherwise , claimed responsibility for either the attack in Ottawa or the one near Montreal .\nMonday \u2019 s attacker , 25-year-old Martin Rouleau , who converted to Islam last year , was among 90 people being tracked by the RCMP on suspicion of taking part in militant activities abroad or planning to do so .\nCanada announced this month it was joining the battle against Islamic State fighters who have taken over parts of Iraq and Syria .\nGUNS DRAWN IN PARLIAMENT From witness accounts it appeared the suspect dashed into parliament , ran past the room where Harper was speaking and was gunned down outside the entrance to the library , only about 60 feet ( 20 meters ) away .\nDramatic video footage posted by the Globe and Mail newspaper showed police with guns drawn inside the main parliament building .\nAt least a dozen loud bangs can be heard on the clip , echoing through the hallway .\nVeterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino , a former policeman , told the Toronto Sun that parliament \u2019 s head of security , Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers , shot dead a suspected gunman .\nCanadian cabinet minister Jason Kenney said a guard in parliament buildings was also wounded in the incident .\nHarper stressed that government and parliament should continue its work , a spokesman said .\n\u201c While the prime minister stated that facts are still being gathered , he condemned this despicable attack , \u201d the spokesman said .\nHarper , who was meeting with cabinet ministers on Wednesday evening , was expected to make a statement later in the day .\nSlideshow ( 24 images ) Canada said on Tuesday it had raised the national terrorism threat level to medium from low because of a rise in \u201c general chatter \u201d from radical groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda but said there had not been a specific threat .\nThe RCMP \u2019 s Michaud said the threat level on Parliament Hill had been on medium for some time .\nThe soldier who died in the shooting at the War Memorial was identified as Cpl .\nNathan Cirillo , according to his aunt .\nCirillo was a member of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders , a regiment of Reserve Forces based in Hamilton , and was training to join the Canada Border Services Agency , a federal agency responsible for border and immigration enforcement , his aunt told The Globe and Mail .\nIt was not clear if Cirillo was armed or not when he was shot .\nSlideshow ( 24 images ) \u2018 YOU ARE IN DANGER HERE \u2019 The attack on the heart of the country \u2019 s government shook Canada \u2019 s self-image as generally non-violent , particularly compared to the United States , where gun violence is much more common .\nCanadian cities and towns hiked security around government buildings , schools and mass transit systems .\nAs the drama in Ottawa unfolded , police in dark bulletproof vests and carrying automatic rifles flooded the streets near parliament , clearing several blocks of downtown Ottawa .\nSome took cover behind vehicles and shouted to people to clear the area , saying : \u201c We do not have the suspect in custody .\nYou are in danger here. \u201d When the shooting started , most members of parliament were in the two caucus rooms past which the gunman ran .\nMembers were told to lock or barricade themselves in their rooms or offices , and stay away from the windows .\nA tweeted picture sent from the room where the opposition New Democrats were holding a weekly caucus showed a pile of chairs jammed up against the main door to prevent anyone from entering .\nU.S. officials said there was no specific indication of a similar attack in the United States , a strong Canadian ally , but reinforced warnings to Americans to be alert .\n\u201c As a matter of precaution due to recent events , the FBI has reminded our field offices and government partners to remain vigilant in light of recent calls for attacks against government personnel by terrorist groups and like-minded individuals , \u201d U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman Paul Bresson said .\nCanadian and U.S. stock markets declined after the shootings in Ottawa .\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange 's TSX index .GSPTSE dropped 1.6 percent , while the S & P 500 .SPX gave back 0.7 percent .\nMass shootings are relatively rare in Canada , which has stricter gun laws than the United States , and the regulations at one point included a national registry of rifles and shotguns .\nLegislation was passed in 2012 to scrap the registry .\nOttawa also has a low murder rate .\nThere were nine homicides in 2013 and seven in 2012 , in a city of 885,000 people .\nCompared with Capitol Hill in Washington , security on Parliament Hill is also fairly low key .\nAnybody could walk right up to the front door of parliament \u2019 s Centre Block with arms and explosives without being challenged before entering the front door , where a few guards check accreditation .\nCentre Block is the main building on Parliament Hill , a sprawling complex of buildings and open space in downtown Ottawa .\nIt contains the House of Commons and Senate chambers as well as the offices of some members of parliament , senators , and senior administration for both legislative houses .\nA construction worker who was on the scene in Ottawa when the shooting began told Reuters he heard a gunshot , and then saw a man with a scarf over his face running towards parliament .\n\u201c He was wearing blue pants and a black jacket and he had a double barreled shotgun and he ran up the side of this building here and hijacked a car at gunpoint , \u201d construction worker Scott Walsh told Reuters .\nThe driver got out safely , then the man drove the car to the Centre Block , where construction work is under way , Walsh said .\nThe Canadian military closed its bases across the country to the public following the events in Ottawa , CBC TV said .\nThe attacks in Ottawa and Quebec took place as the Canadian government prepared to boost the powers of its spy agency , the Canadian Security Intelligence Service .\nPublic Safety Minister Stephen Blaney said last Thursday the new legislation would let the agency track and investigate potential terrorists when

{"label": true, "txt": "Kunstmuseum Bern Accepts Gurlitt CollectionAt a joint press conference in Berlin on Monday , the Kunstmuseum Bern and the German government announced that the Swiss museum will accept the trove of artworks bequeathed to it by the late collector Cornelius Gurlitt .\nMany among the nearly 1,300 works of art\u2014which include pieces by Henri Matisse , Max Liebermann , Otto Dix , and Marc Chagall\u2014are suspected of having been looted by the Nazis .\nKunstmuseum Bern president Christoph Schaeublin made assurances that his institution would make every effort to return those works to their rightful heirs , when announcing his board \u2019 s decision .\nAccording to the agreement , all of the works will remain in Germany until questions surrounding their provenance can be cleared up .\nThe task force has said that the process will now stretch until 2015 , possibly beyond ( see \u201c Gurlitt Taskforce Will Miss Restitution Deadline \u201c ) .\nSchaeublin noted that this fulfills the agreement that was reached between German authorities and Gurlitt before his death , which provided for full research in the provenance of works in the collection and the return of those found to have been looted by the Nazi regime .\nHe also confirmed that a full list of works included in the collection would be published as soon as Tuesday , a move which has been requested since the collection \u2019 s discovery was made public and is expected to assist potential heirs in locating their works .\nThe German government will also pay for all legal costs associated with future legal claims against the museum with regard to the Gurlitt collection .\nEarlier this month , Jewish World Congress president Ronald Lauder cautioned that the Kunstmuseum Bern would be opening itself up to an \u201c avalanche \u201d of lawsuits if the institution was to accept the collection , speculating that numerous heirs would subsequently come forward and attempt to restitute works from Gurlitt \u2019 s former holdings ( see \u201c Ronald Lauder Warns of Lawsuit \u201c Avalanche \u201d over Gurlitt Collection \u201c ) .\nHe warned that the Kunstmuseum Bern \u201c would become a museum of stolen art \u201d by accepting the works .\nDiscovered in 2012 Just over one year ago , the world learned of the monumental trove of Nazi looted art found by tax authorities in Cornelius Gurlitt \u2019 s Munich apartment and later at a residence in Salzburg .\nThe hoard was discovered in 2012 , following suspicions that Gurlitt was evading taxes .\nWorks suspected to have been looted by the Nazis have since been placed on the central register for all artworks suspected of having been stolen , Lost Art .\nGurlitt died on May 6th of this year and left a will , which bequeathed the entire collection to the Swiss museum ( see \u201c Gurlitt Bequeathed Collection to Museum of Fine Arts Bern \u201c ) .\nRepresentatives of heirs who spoke to artnet News said that the restitution process was hobbled by the bequest despite conclusions by the German task force that the works\u2014some of the collection \u2019 s most prominent\u2014should be returned to their rightful heirs .\nLegal representatives for 88-year-old David Toren , who escaped Nazi Germany at the age of 14 , expressed their approval of the decision to artnet News , ahead of its official announcement .\n\u201c It \u2019 s certainly good news for my client , \u201d said Toren \u2019 s attorney August Matteis , \u201c because this will most likely end the log jam that has kept the painting out of Mr. Toren \u2019 s hands up until now. \u201d The German task force determined that Toren was the rightful heir of Max Liebermann \u2019 s Two Riders on the Beach ( 1901 ) in August ( see \u201c Gurlitt Task Force Sides with Nazi Victim \u201c ) .\nThe painting had been stolen from the Breslau villa of Toren \u2019 s great uncle , David Friedman .\nDespite that verdict , little headway had apparently been made to return the painting in the several months since the task force \u2019 s decision .\nNow , according to Matteis , \u201c There \u2019 s absolutely no reason for any further delay [ \u2026 ] They should have given [ the painting ] back a lot sooner , from our perspective , obviously .\nBut now there really are no further obstacles in the way. \u201d Matisse \u2019 s Sitting Woman Restitution Speaking to artnet News directly after Monday \u2019 s announcement , Art Recovery International founder Christopher Marinello , who represents the family of lauded art dealer Paul Rosenberg , said \u201c We are extremely grateful to the museum for taking on this responsibility , accepting the bequest and pledging their adherence to Washington Principles. \u201d He noted that there are still several steps ahead before his clients would receive Matisse \u2019 s Sitting Woman , but added \u201c The lawyer for the museum and I have been in contact , \u201d and had already begun the paperwork necessary to complete a successful restitution .\nMarinello believes it is \u201c only a matter of time \u201d before an official date for that to occur can be set .\nThe museum \u2019 s decision to accept the collection comes just three days after Gurlitt \u2019 s cousin , Uta Werner , is said to have filed papers in a Munich court contesting the validity of the art collector \u2019 s will and thus the ability for the Kunstmuseum to accept his bequest .\nHowever , it appears that German authorities do not expect the last minute legal action to hold water .\nThe legal challenge would place Werner and several other relatives in charge of the collection .\nIt follows the leak of results from a psychological assessment of Gurlitt , shortly before his death , that was ordered by Werner and fellow cousin , Dietrich Gurlitt .\nThe assessment concluded that Gurlitt \u201c suffered from mild dementia , a schizophrenic personality disorder , and a delusional disorder , \u201d at the time of the will \u2019 s writing and thus was potentially unfit to make the bequest ( see \u201c Gurlitt Was Mentally Unfit to Write Will , Cousins Claim \u201c ) .\nAccording to the AP , the cousins \u2019 challenge of the will would have to be concluded before the collection would be able to depart for Switzerland .\nRegardless of that outcome , Art Recovery \u2019 s Marinello believes that the works will be returned to their rightful heirs .\n\u201c We have been contacted by the representative of Gurlitt \u2019 s heirs , \u201d including those who filed the claim on Friday , \u201c and their statements are that they will return works that have been looted. \u201d He does , however , note that such a process would have likely been more lengthy than it will with the Kunstmuseum Bern , assuming all goes as announced on Monday .\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook :"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Five Holistic Doctors DeadAdvertisment : In mid-July 2015 , a number of articles on the subject of recently deceased alternative health practitioners began to circulate on social media .\nOne of those ( articles ( `` 5 Holistic Health Doctors Found Dead In 4 Weeks , 5 More Go Missing \u2014 After Run-Ins with Feds '' ) appeared to have inspired several other similar articles , but the claims they made were mostly congruent .\nThe web site HealthNutNews published one of the first iterations , offering a list of recently deceased physicians , chiropractors , and osteopaths : June 19th , 2015 \u2013 Dr Bradstreet ... was found with a gunshot wound to his chest in a river .\nThe small town locals ruled the death almost immediately as a suicide ; but many have their doubts .\nThis same day in Mexico ... three doctors were traveling to the State Capital in Mexico , to deliver some papers .\nThey were reported missing that day .\nThis portion of the article referenced one of the five `` holistic health doctors '' who was found dead , as well as three nameless doctors who went `` missing '' in Mexico in circumstances seemingly related to each another only by date .\nNo information was provided about what readers were supposed to infer from this information .\nThe deceased doctor to whom the author referred was James Jeffrey Bradstreet , a controversial figure found dead of a gunshot wound in a river in June 2015 .\nBradstreet , 61 , was subject to a Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) raid shortly before his death , which police said appeared to be suicide .\nAs for the missing Mexican doctors , a 9 July 2015 article in the Daily Beast profiled their case and gave no indication that the individuals affected were in any way affiliated with alternative medicine or were on the radar of the FDA .\nIn fact , there are no clear parallels between the deceased `` holistic health doctors '' included in the conspiracy theory and the missing Mexican doctors that we could find .\nAnother portion of the article stated : June 21st , 2015 \u2014 Father \u2019 s Day : We have two dead chiropractors , Dr. Holt [ 33 ] and Dr. Hedendal [ 67 ] ( both reported to be fathers ) , in Florida ; both found on the East Coast , both were presumably healthy , and both were described as very fit .\nWe still have no cause of death listed in the articles we can find on either one .\nA definitive cause of death for Hedendal has indeed been difficult to turn up , but Florida television station WBBH cited `` natural causes '' as a possibility .\n( Hedendal was 67 at the time of his death . )\nComments on an online obituary for Hedendal included remarks ( # 41 ) from an individual named Rudy Vlaardingerbroek , who noted that : I knew Bruce well for almost twenty years .\nI enjoyed chatting with him and throwing the discus .\nOn Father 's Day he was at the Sunshine State Games and felt dizzy throwing the discus and even fell once .\nHe just didn \u2019 t look good acc .\nto other throwers , although his last throw was 133 .\nHe was given water and Gatorade , went to his car and passed away sitting there .\nHe must have died of severe hydration , which may have led to a heart attack .\nWe will surely miss him .\nAs for Holt , his cause of death was indeed not readily available in searches ( which have now been crowded out by conspiracy theory ramblings ) .\nAn article on his death published in Raleigh News & Observer reported that that information was still pending : [ Holt 's ] unexpected death last month while on a trip to Jacksonville , Fla. has been a blow to his family and the community he 'd created through his work .\nThough he had been struggling with recent health issues , none were thought to be life threatening by loved ones .\nHis family is awaiting the results from an autopsy report < .\nWe found no indication that Hedendal or Holt had experienced run-ins with the FDA ( as had Bradstreet ) in recent months .\nThe next portion of the original article stated : June 26th , 2015 \u2014 Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick MD goes missing .\nHe was traveling from North Dakota , to neighboring Montana ( which he did often as his son lived there ) , and his truck and trailer were found on the side of the road .\nThe search has expanded , but authorities say it \u2019 s like he vanished without a trace .\nHe \u2019 s 6\u2032 tall , and described as Irish-looking , with a goatee ; and details can be found on the links .\nActually , Dr. Patrick Fitzpatrick of Bismarck , North Dakota was last seen on 2 July 2015 .\nDr. Fitzpatrick did not seem a likely candidate for a massive big pharma hit job , nor was he an `` alternative health '' practitioner of any description .\nArticles published about his disappearance described him as a retired ophthalmologist known for forays into nature preserves , who 'd grown increasingly frail in recent years : [ Lieutenant Arlyn Greydanus ] says the 74-year-old suffers from medical conditions that require medicine and could suffer from confusion .\nHe also struggles with walking great distances and walks slowly , but is believed to have possibly gotten a ride from the area where his car was abandoned .\n`` From where the vehicle is stuck there are many different directions he could go .\nHe 's actually stuck in what 's called a pea field .\nIt \u2019 s very difficult to walk through that that field was searched extensively by helicopter and you would have been able to see if someone walked through there .\nThere 's a two-track road that he drove in on and possibly walked out on , '' Lt. Greydanus said .\nThe article continued with the following : June 29th , 2015 \u2014 The beloved holistic Theresa Sievers MD was found murdered in her home .\nJeffrey Whiteside MD a pulmonologist went missing , vanishing when he simply `` walked away . ''\nDr. Whiteside , known for his successful treatment of lung cancer , disappeared in Door County , Wisconsin , while vacationing with family .\nThey say he was on foot , and had no vehicle ; and numerous reports call it `` mysterious , '' saying he too , vanished without a trace .\nOn 29 June 2015 , Theresa Sievers was bludgeoned to death in her Florida home .\nAn investigation into Sievers ' murder remains open , and law enforcement officials have declined to comment on what they 've found so far .\nBut again , we were unable to turn up any evidence suggesting Sievers had an adversarial relationship with the FDA or any other large , powerful public health agencies before she was brutally murdered , and whoever killed her left a remarkable amount of evidence ( incongruent with a calculated corporate hit ) .\nOn 28 February 2016 , 47-year-old Mark Sievers ( Dr. Sievers ' spouse ) was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in what police alleged was a for-hire plot to cash in on several life-insurance policies .\nAnother entry read : July 10th , 2015 \u2014 Lisa Riley DO ( Doctor of Osteopathic medicine ) is found in her home with a gunshot wound to her head .\nLisa M. Riley , 34 , was indeed a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and not an MD , but her field of practice was listed as the decidedly uncontroversial `` emergency medicine . ''\nIf Dr. Riley had cause to murderously enrage the medical establishment , that cause was well hidden .\nIt 's true that Riley 's death occurred under exceptionally suspicious circumstances .\nShe was found dead of a gunshot wound by her husband in her home on 10 July 2015 , and ten days later the Georgia Bureau of Investigation ( GBI ) announced that Riley 's husband , Yathomas Riley , would be charged in connection with her death : The Americus Office of the GBI is announcing the issuance of arrest warrants for Yathomas Riley in the death of his wife , Dr. Lisa Riley .\nA Lee County magistrate judge issued warrants today charging Riley with Murder , Felony Murder and Aggravated Assault in the death of Dr. Riley .\nThe charges stem from an investigation initiated by GBI agents and the Lee County Sheriff \u2019 s Office when her body was reported discovered by Yathomas Riley at their Northampton Road residence in Leesburg on July 10 , 2015 .\nRiley has remained in custody at the Lee County Jail since his arrest on July 10 , 2015 for charges unrelated to his wife \u2019 s death .\nThe extensive investigation into the matter is still ongoing .\nYathomas Riley was implicated in a similar situation in 2010 involving his then-girlfriend Koketia King .\nThat woman was shot in the head as well , and Riley claimed the wound was self-inflicted .\nKing survived .\nLater articles also tied the death of Dr. Ronald Schwartz , 65 , to the conspiracy .\nSchwartz was found shot to death in his Jupiter , Florida , home on 19 July 2015 , but the deceased was neither an alternative health practitioner nor embroiled in any controversy at the time of his apparent murder .\nSchwartz , an obstetrician and gynecologist , was licensed in Tennessee and Georgia ( not Florida ) and believed to be functionally retired from medicine .\nHis neighbors described him as quiet and reclusive .\nSo while Bradstreet died of an apparently self-inflicted wound under increasing FDA heat ( and following a recent raid ) , none of the other doctors subsequently tacked on to conspiracies regarding his death led similar lives .\nOf the four missing doctors , one was elderly and retired , and three vanished in Mexico ( where they lived and worked ) .\nDr. Holt 's passing was a shock to many , but autopsy results are pending .\nDr. Hedendal was 67 and passed away after a day of strenuous physical activity ( presumably of natural causes ) .\nThe murder of Dr. Sievers remains unsolved but was unlikely to have been carried out by high-level hitmen .\nDr. Riley 's husband ( implicated in a similar shooting in 2010 ) was charged in connection with her suspicious death .\nUpdate : On 28 August 2015 , police in Missouri arrested two men in connection with the murder of Dr. Sievers .\nThe arrests were announced in a press conference that day ; Lee County Sheriff Mike Scott said that two `` vicious killers are in custody , '' but declined to elaborate with respect to the circumstances of the murders : Two men were jailed in Missouri in connection with the slaying of Bonita Springs doctor Teresa Sievers , and one of the suspects is an old friend of her husband , Mark Sievers .\nCurtis Wayne Wright Jr. , 47 , and Jimmy Rodgers , 25 , face second-degree murder charges .\nWright , who goes by his middle name , Wayne , has been friends with Mark Sievers since their high school days in Hillsboro , Missouri , according to mutual friends .\nScott would not answer questions from reporters , saying the case was active and ongoing .\nHe did not reveal the cause of death , manner of death or a possible motive , but he did say the case was the `` most complicated , intricate set of circumstances that most of us have ever seen . ''\nthose who deeply distrust medicine and science might take the list 's assertions as plausible , but under the slightest scrutiny its claims disintegrate .\nGiven the breadth of fields in which these individuals practiced ( e.g. , chiropracty , obstetrics , ophthalmology ) , millions of Americans could conceivably be counted among their ranks .\nEven if all the deaths and disappearances were suspicious ( which most of them appeared not to be ) , five people out of millions is a very small percentage .\nThe claims were not unlike the `` Clinton Body Count '' rumor , by which every dead person who had the slightest link to the Clintons was drafted into a broad , vague conspiracy theory .\nThis rumor ( like its predecessor ) cherry-picked information that fit its narrative ( such as timeframe ) while discarding the facts that did n't fit ( such as mainstream area of practice or later-explained circumstances/arrests ) .\nUpdate : On 23 July 2015 the web site Freedom Outpost published an article titled `` Two More Doctors Found Dead \u2014 That Makes 7 in a Month , '' and on 24 July 2015 the Free Thought Project web site published an article titled `` Another Florida Doctor Murdered , Bringing Total to 8 Dead & 5 Missing in Just the Last Month . ''\nThe former claimed that the July 2015 murder of Dr. Amanda Crews ( along with four other individuals ) was one of the `` latest '' suspicious doctor deaths ( Crews was not a holistic doctor and practiced general family medicine ) .\nDr. Crews ( along with her two children , another child , and her partner 's mother ) was found dead on 18 July 2015 .\nHowever , Crews ' former romantic partner was identified almost immediately as a suspect : Martin Martinez , 30 , has been formally charged with killing his girlfriend 's 2-year-old toddler last October .\nHe was also a suspect in the Saturday homicides of girlfriend Dr. Amanda Crews , their 6-month-old daughter , her 6-year-old daughter , his mother and an unidentified 5-year-old girl .\nAll of the deaths occurred in the homes Martinez shared with Crews , 38 .\nPolice have n't disclosed the cause of death for the five people killed in Modesto or discussed possible motives .\nMartinez is n't charged with their deaths , but police say he 's their prime suspect .\nA lengthy profile published in People magazine about Dr. Crews ' life and career detailed the circumstances of her family life and provided additional details about her death .\nFreedom Outpost 's article readily admitted that Dr. Crews ( who , again , was not a `` holistic doctor '' ) was likely murdered by a romantic partner in an act of domestic violence .\nThe site explained that the multiple murders were likely unrelated to any other doctors ' deaths , even after insinuating that doctors were being targeted and killed in a wide-ranging conspiracy : Are these doctors ' deaths all related somehow ?\nThe Crews death does seem strangely off , especially considering there is a suspect in custody and that he is also suspected of killing a child in October 2014 .\nOther than that , it seems that doctors are facing a high rate of deaths , eerily similar to bankers in the past couple of years .\nThe Free Thought Project also cited the July 2015 death of Dr .\nNorm Castellano , a Tampa-area dentist , among the list of `` mysterious '' doctor deaths .\nCastellano ( again , not a `` holistic doctor '' ) died on 13 July 2015 , and multiple Facebook posts published by grieving friends and patients indicated that his cause of death ( while not publicly disclosed ) was in no way suspicious or unexplained .\nThat web site also referenced the 21 July 2015 death of Dr. Nicholas J. Gonzalez .\n( While the article 's title suggested a cluster of doctor deaths occurred in Florida , Gonzalez was based and died in New York . )\nGonzalez was an alternative medicine practitioner , but the circumstances under which he died ( as described on his web site ) were not suspicious : It is with great sadness that the office of Nicholas J. Gonzalez , M.D .\nrelays news of his untimely death on Tuesday , July 21 , 2015 .\nThe cause of death was cardiac related , it appears , as he suddenly collapsed and was unable to be revived .\nDr. Gonzalez was in excellent health otherwise so his passing is quite unexpected .\nThe rumor ( currently attached to a number of separate and ostensibly unrelated tragedies ) continued to suggest imaginary or tenuous links to support an assertion that the deaths were somehow connected .\nWhile headlines crowed about deaths in Florida , several of the doctors died in other states and had no obvious link to that state .\nMoreover , the claims centered upon the purported targeting of alternative medicine doctors despite the fact that several of the individuals included were mainstream , science-based medical providers .\nAs the rumor spread , the inclusion of mainstream doctors across several states highlighted that the death of any doctor in July 2015 was likely to be conscripted into the ( still unarticulated ) conspiracy , whether or not that doctor lived in Florida or practiced alternative medicine .\n( Some sources have attempted to link all the deceased doctors together through the common thread of their advocacy of Globulin component Macrophage Activating Factor , or GcMAF , a protein that a handful of doctors have claimed can cure anything from cancer to autism by boosting the human immune system .\nHowever , only Dr. Bradstreet has been connected to its use . )\nAs of March 2015 , there was an estimated range of 897,000 to just over 1,000,000 doctors in the United States , and per every 100,000 people ( of all vocations ) each year , approximately 821 die .\nGoing by those numbers alone , between 6,500 and 8,200 medical doctors will statistically die of myriad causes in any given year .\nEach month approximately 700 doctors would die ( based upon the number of American doctors and the number of overall deaths ) , thirteen of whom could be expected to live in Florida before accounting for rate fluctuations based on whether a state ( like Florida ) is exceptionally populous .\nAs such , six to eight deaths is well within the realm of expected doctor deaths ."}

49-year-old self-styled \u2018 Muslim cleric and peace activist \u2019 named Man Haron Monis , who is currently on bail facing dozens of charges of indecent and sexual assault .\nMonis , who also goes by the names Mohammad Hassan Manteghi and Manteghi Boroujerdi , was infamously involved in sending \u2018 grossly offensive \u2019 letters to parents and relatives of Australian victims of terrorism and troops killed in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2009 .\nHe unsuccessfully challenged the conviction in the high court last year .\nThe Iranian-born man , who apparently converted from Shia Islam to Sunni only last week , has also been accused of being an accessory in the killing of his ex-wife , a charge for which he remains on bail .\nHe told ABC News in 2001 that he fled Australia five years earlier after falling foul of the Iranian regime , which he said had placed his wife and children under house arrest .\n\u2018 I can say they are hostage , \u2019 he said at the time .\nMan Haron Monis pictured in Sydney in April 2011 .\nPhotograph : Dean Lewins/epa/corbis A fringe figure in Australia \u2019 s Muslim community , Monis has been spurned by Shia leaders , who have reportedly urged federal police to investigate the man over his claims to be an ayatollah , or Shia cleric .\nAccording to a post on his website , Monis converted to Sunni Islam in December , labelling Shia Muslims as \u2018 rejectionists \u2019 .\nA rambling October letter he penned to the Muslim community rejected the \u2018 new religion \u2019 of moderate Islam .\n\u2018 This pen is my gun and these

''\nSince 2009 , the Philadelphia area has `` become a gateway for U.S.-Israeli trade , '' with about 25 percent , or an estimated $ 5 billion , `` of all Israeli exports to the U.S. passing through our region , '' Bendit said .\nPassengers on the inaugural flight to Tel Aviv on July 2 , 2009 said they were appreciative to have another option for flying directly to Israel , and said the fares were cheaper than those from other cities .\nPreviously , Philadelphians bound for Israel flew out of Newark or New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport .\nIsrael 's El Al Airlines had dominated the market , although Delta Air Lines and United Airlines fly to Tel Aviv from the New York area .\n`` We looked at every single option with every single aircraft that we have , '' Workman said .\n`` The reason we 've had the route in place for six years is because of the tremendous support we 've had from the city , '' including political leaders and the business community .\nThe 5,700-mile flight is about 12 hours to Israel and 13 hours back , and was the longest in the US Airways ' network and its first to the Middle East .\nThe route required two aircraft .\nUS Airways used Airbus A330-200 planes with 258 seats .\n`` The flights were full for the most part , '' Workman said .\n`` But that 's not an indicator of profitability .\nIt depends on what yield you are getting from your customers , '' he said .\n`` Any airline can fill any flight full if you drop your price low enough .\nWe were not getting the revenue from the passenger side of the aircraft that we needed to make this flight profitable .

Walter Jones ( R-N.C. ) echoed that sentiment , urging Ryan and the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , Rep. Hal Rogers ( R-Ky. ) , to block funding for refugees in the upcoming budget battle .\nAdvertisement \u201c As you know , the president recently announced that he intends to annually allow 100,000 individuals into America through this program , many of them radical Muslims from the Middle East , \u201d Jones wrote in a letter to Ryan on Monday .\n( The administration has said it would admit 85,000 refugees total for the fiscal year , 10,000 of which would be Syrian . )\nJones added that given the recent \u201c terrible slaughter of innocent civilians \u201d by terrorists in Paris , he \u201c will not vote for any bill that provides funding for the Obama administration \u2019 s dangerous \u201d resettlement plan .\nOn the other side of the Capitol , Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R-Ala. ) is pushing a similar agenda , encouraging his colleagues to make sure the omnibus spending bill includes a provision requiring congressional approval for the president 's refugee resettlement program .\nSessions also wants to require that the administration fully offset the costs , and identify foreigners admitted into the U.S. as refugees since 2001 who have since been involved in crime or terrorism .\n\u201c The barbaric attacks in Paris -- an assault on civilization itself -- add immense new urgency , \u201d Sessions wrote in a letter to the Appropriations Committee on Monday .\nAdvertisement All the senators running for the Republican presidential nomination -- Rand Paul ( Ky. ) , Lindsey Graham ( S.C. ) , Marco Rubio ( Fla. ) , and Ted Cruz ( Texas ) -- also called for a stop to admitting Syrian refugees due to the Paris attacks .\nLeaders on Capitol Hill are facing additional pressure from Republican governors who came out one by one on Monday against admitting refugees to their states .\nFlorida Gov .\nRick Scott ( R ) wrote to Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) directly , asking them to take \u201c immediate and aggressive \u201d action to block funding for the refugee program .\n\u201c It is our understanding that the state does not have the authority to prevent the federal government from funding the relocation of these Syrian refugees to Florida even without state support , \u201d Scott admitted .\nPiling on , Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee called out the new House speaker on Twitter .\nAdvertisement If @ SpeakerRyan will not lead & reject the importation of those fleeing the Middle East he needs to step down today & let someone else lead .\n\u2014 Gov .\nMike Huckabee ( @ GovMikeHuckabee ) November 16 , 2015 Matt Fuller contributed reporting ."}

crashed into a mountainside in the French Alps on Tuesday , killing all 150 people on board including 16 schoolchildren .\nGermanwings confirmed its flight 4U 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers and six crew on board .\nOne of the plane \u2019 s black box recorders has been found at the crash site , about 100 km ( 65 miles ) north of the Riviera city of Nice , and will be examined immediately , France \u2019 s interior minister said .\nIn Washington , the White House said the crash did not appear to have been caused by a terrorist attack , while Lufthansa said it was working on the assumption that the tragedy had been an accident , adding that any other theory would be speculation .\nAerial photographs showed smoldering wreckage and a piece of the fuselage with six windows strewn across the steep mountainside cut by ravines .\n\u201c We saw an aircraft that had literally been ripped apart , the bodies are in a state of destruction , there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage , \u201d Brice Robin , prosecutor for the city of Marseille , told Reuters after flying over the wreckage in a helicopter .\nGermanwings believed 67 Germans had been on the flight .\nSpain \u2019 s deputy prime minister said 45 passengers had Spanish names .\nOne Belgian was also aboard .\nAlso among the victims were 16 children and two teachers from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in the town of Haltern am See in northwest Germany , a spokeswoman said .\nBarcelona \u2019 s Liceu opera house said on Twitter that two singers , Kazakhstan-born Oleg Bryjak and German Maria Radner , had died while returning to Duesseldorf after they had performed in Wagner \u2019 s Siegfried at the theater .\nFrench police at the crash site about 2,000 meters ( 6,000 feet ) above sea level said no one had survived and it would take days to recover the bodies due to difficult terrain , snow and incoming storms .\nPolice said search teams would stay overnight at altitude .\n\u201c We are still searching .\nIt \u2019 s unlikely any bodies will be airlifted until Wednesday , \u201d regional police chief David Galtier told Reuters .\nIn Paris , Prime Minister Manuel Valls told parliament : \u201c A helicopter managed to land ( by the crash site ) and has confirmed that unfortunately there were no survivors. \u201d It was the first crash of a large passenger jet on French soil since the Concorde disaster just outside Paris nearly 15 years ago .\nThe A320 is a workhorse of aviation fleets and one of the world \u2019 s most used passenger jets .\nIt has a good safety record .\nHowever , according to data from the Aviation Safety Network , Tuesday \u2019 s crash was the third most deadly involving an A320 .\nIn 2007 a TAM Linhas Aereas A320 shot off a runway in Brazil , killing 187 people , while 162 people died when an Indonesia AirAsia jet went down in the Java Sea in December .\nSHARP DESCENT Germanwings said the plane started descending one minute after reaching its cruising height and continued losing altitude for eight minutes .\n\u201c The aircraft \u2019 s contact with French radar , French air traffic controllers , ended at 10.53 am at an altitude of about 6,000 feet .\nThe plane then crashed , \u201d Germanwings \u2019 Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a news conference .\nSlideshow ( 17 images ) Winkelmann also said that routine maintenance of the aircraft was performed by Lufthansa on Monday .\nExperts said that while the Airbus had descended rapidly , its rate of descent did not suggest it had simply fallen out of the sky .\nFrance \u2019 s DGAC aviation authority said air traffic controllers initiated distress procedures after they lost contact with the Airbus .\n\u201c The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft \u2019 s descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase , \u201d a DGAC spokesman said .\nSlideshow ( 17 images ) In emergencies , pilots are trained to try to fly the aircraft as their first priority , then pay attention to navigation and only then communicate with the ground .\nThe aircraft came down in an alpine region known for skiing , hiking and rafting , but which is hard for rescue services to reach .\nThe search and recovery effort based itself in a gymnasium in the village of Seyne-les-Alpes , which has a small private aerodrome nearby .\nSTORMS , SNOW , CLOUD As helicopters and emergency vehicles assembled , the weather was reported to be closing in .\n\u201c There will be a lot of cloud cover this afternoon , with local storms , snow above 1,800 meters and relatively low clouds .\nThat will not help the helicopters in their work , \u201d an official from the local weather center told Reuters .\nLufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr , who planned to go to the crash site , spoke of a \u201c dark day for Lufthansa \u201d .\n\u201c My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew , \u201d Lufthansa said on Twitter , citing Spohr .\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would travel to the site on Wednesday .\nGermanwings and the Catalan regional government were preparing to take Spanish relatives there .\nFamily members arrived at Barcelona \u2019 s El Prat airport , many crying and with arms around each others \u2019 shoulders , accompanied by police and airport staff .\nIn Llinars del Valles , the Spanish village that hosted the German schoolchildren , Mayor Marti Pujol said the whole village was distraught .\n\u201c The families knew each other , \u201d he told Reuters .\n\u201c The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning. \u201d King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain called off a state visit to France in a sign of mourning for the victims .\nThey had arrived in Paris minutes after the crash happened .\nIn Washington , President Barack Obama said his thoughts and prayers were with Germany and Spain after what he called the \u201c awful tragedy \u201d .\nAirbus confirmed that the plane was 24 years old , having first been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991 .\nIt was powered by engines made by CFM International , a joint venture between General Electric and France \u2019 s Safran ."}

and the dangers of their lack , we think the choice of words to be omitted shocking and poorly considered , \u201d the authors have written to OUP .\n\u201c When , in 2007 , the OJD made the changes , this connection was understood , but less well publicised than now .\nThe research evidence showing the links between natural play and wellbeing ; and between disconnection from nature and social ills , is mounting. \u201d The 28 signatories to the letter , who also include Sara Maitland , Helen Macdonald and Ruth Padel , say their concern is \u201c not just a romantic desire to reflect the rosy memories of our own childhoods onto today \u2019 s youngsters \u201d .\n\u201c There is a shocking , proven connection between the decline in natural play and the decline in children \u2019 s wellbeing , \u201d they write , pointing to research which found that a generation ago , 40 % of children regularly played in natural areas , compared to 10 % today , with a further 40 % never playing outdoors .\n\u201c Obesity , anti-social behaviour , friendlessness and fear are the known consequences , \u201d they say .\nThe campaign has been pulled together by Laurence Rose , who works for the RSPB and who provided a list of words taken out , including hamster , heron , herring , kingfisher , lark , leopard , lobster , magpie , minnow , mussel , newt , otter , ox , oyster and panther .\n\u201c Will the removal of these words from the OJD ruin lives ?\nProbably not , \u201d say the authors .\n\u201c But as a symptom of a widely acknowledged problem that is ruining lives , this omission becomes a major issue .\nThe Oxford Dictionaries have a rightful authority and a leading place in cultural life .\nWe believe the OJD should address these issues and that it should seek to help shape children \u2019 s understanding of the world , not just to mirror its trends. \u201d They tell the publisher \u201c that a deliberate and publicised decision to restore some of the most important nature words would be a tremendous cultural signal and message of support for natural childhood \u201d , and ask it to \u201c take that opportunity , and if necessary , bring forward the next edition of the OJD in order to do so \u201d .\nMacfarlane , whose forthcoming book Landmarks , which looks at the relationship between nature and language , was originally inspired by the OJD \u2019 s changes , pointed to the response in 2008 from the head of children \u2019 s dictionaries at OUP , who said the changes had been made because : \u201c When you look back at older versions of dictionaries , there were lots of examples of flowers for instance .\nThat was because many children lived in semi-rural environments and saw the seasons .\nNowadays , the environment has changed. \u201d \u201c There \u2019 s a realism to her response \u2013 but also an alarming acceptance of the ideas that children might no longer see the seasons , that all childhoods are urban , that all cities are denatured , and that what exists beyond the city fringe or the edge of the computer screen need not be named , \u201d said Macfarlane .\n\u201c We do not care for what we do not know , and on the whole we do not know what we can not name .\nDo we want an alphabet for children that begins \u2018 A is for Acorn , B is for Buttercup , C is for Conker \u2019 ; or one that begins \u2018 A is for Attachment , B is for Block-Graph , C is for Chatroom \u2019 ? \u201d Motion , the former poet laureate , said that \u201c by discarding so many country and landscape-words from their Junior Dictionary , OUP deny children a store of words that is marvellous for its own sake , but also a vital means of connection and understanding .\n\u201c Their defence \u2013 that lots of children have no experience of the countryside \u2013 is ridiculous .\nDictionaries exist to extend our knowledge , as much ( or more ) as they do to confirm what we already know or half-know , \u201d said Motion .\nA spokesperson for Oxford University Press said : \u201c All our dictionaries are designed to reflect language as it is used , rather than seeking to prescribe certain words or word usages .\nWe employ extremely rigorous editorial guidelines in determining which words [ can ] be included in each dictionary , based on several criteria : acknowledging the current frequency of words in daily language of children of that age ; corpus analysis ; acknowledging commonly misspelled or misused words ; and taking curriculum requirements into account .\n\u201c The Oxford Junior Dictionary is very much an introduction to language .\nIt includes around 400 words related to nature including badger , bird , caterpillar , daffodil , feather , hedgehog , invertebrate , ladybird , ocean , python , sunflower , tadpole , vegetation , and zebra .\nMany words that do not appear in the Oxford Junior Dictionary are included in the Oxford Primary Dictionary ; a more comprehensive dictionary designed to see students through to age 11 .\nWords included in this title include mistletoe , gerbil , acorn , goldfish , guinea pig , dandelion , starling , fern , willow , conifer , heather , buttercup , sycamore , holly , ivy , and conker .\n\u201c We have no firm plans to publish a new edition of the Oxford Junior Dictionary at this stage .\nHowever , we welcome feedback on all our dictionaries and feed this into the editorial process . \u201d"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Gunman among 3 dead after police storm Sydney cafe , ending siegeSixteen hours after a self-styled Muslim cleric took at least 17 hostages in a cafe in the heart of Sydney , armed police stormed the building , ending the crisis .\nThree people , including the gunman , were killed .\nThe dead hostages were a 38-year-old woman and a 34-year-old man , authorities said .\nFour people were injured , police told reporters Tuesday morning local time .\n\u201c This morning I come before you with the heaviest of hearts ; unbelievably overnight we have lost some of our own , \u201d New South Wales Premier Michael Baird said at the news conference .\n\u201c We are shaken by a tragedy none of us could have imagined. \u201d Advertisement Police said they believe that the gunman acted alone .\nHe was widely reported to be Iranian-born Man Haron Monis , 50 .\n\u201c This is an isolated incident , \u201d Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said .\n\u201c This should never destroy or change our way of life .\nThis will not change the things that we hold dear in this country. \u201d In a separate appearance , Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott expressed his thanks to police for their handling of the situation and offered sympathy to the victims .\n\u201c Our hearts go out to all of those caught in this appalling incident , \u201d he said .\n\u201c These events do demonstrate that even a country as free , as open , as generous , as safe as ours is vulnerable. \u201d The standoff paralyzed Australia \u2019 s largest city , as authorities closed off a portion of central Sydney after the siege began Monday morning local time .\nIt was Tuesday morning before police made their move after hearing gunshots in the Lindt Chocolat Cafe .\n\u201c They made the call because they believed at that time if they didn \u2019 t enter , there would have been many more lives lost , \u201d Scipione said .\n\u201c There was a number of gunshots that were heard , that caused them to move straight to what we call the ... emergency action plan and that caused them to enter , \u201d he said .\nThere had been reports that the gunman had two bombs in the cafe and had planted two elsewhere , but Scipione said no explosive devices were found in the cafe .\nHe paid tribute to the courage of the police and also the hostages .\nHe said the officers involved \u201c have saved many lives .\nThank you that you \u2019 re there and prepared to do this , to put your life on the line to keep us safe. \u201d One officer was shot in the face in the incident but was doing well and is \u201c grateful to be alive , \u201d Scipione said .\nTelevision caught images of the police assault , which began with a flurry of loud bangs , after which officers could be seen swooping into the cafe .\nExplosions could be heard shortly after six hostages emerged from the cafe , one of them being assisted by anti-terrorism forces .\nMore were removed on gurneys a short time later as police stormed the building .\nAfter the police moved in , one weeping woman was helped out by officers and at least two other people were wheeled out on stretchers .\nMonis , widely identified by Australian media as the gunman , was an Iranian-born radical who claimed to be a Muslim sheik and has been charged in a series of violent crimes .\nHis former lawyer described him as disturbed , and said he was not acting in concert with any terrorist organization .\n\u201c This is a one-off , random individual .\nIt \u2019 s not a concerted terrorism event or act .\nIt \u2019 s a damaged-goods individual who \u2019 s done something outrageous , \u201d the lawyer , Manny Conditsis , told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. \u201c His ideology is just so strong and so powerful that it clouds his vision for common sense and objectiveness , \u201d Conditsis said .\nMonis arrived in Australia in 1996 as a refugee , and if he is implicated in the crime , it may inflame local sentiment against refugees arriving by boat , a hot-button issue in Australia .\nMonis had been facing charges as an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife , and was also charged earlier this year with dozens of counts of sexual assault , allegedly carried out when he claimed to be a spiritual healer and was treating women .\nHaron was due in court in February to answer the charges .\nMonis gained notoriety in Australia in recent years over a hate-mail campaign targeting the families of soldiers who died serving in Afghanistan , comparing their bodies to pigs .\nHe was charged and convicted for using the postal service to harass people .\nHe appealed that conviction , claiming he was a peace activist whose rights to freedom of speech had been infringed .\nMonis has repeatedly attacked Australian politicians , including Prime Minister Abbott , on social media , calling them racists and terrorists .\nHe claimed that he was under constant attack by the authorities and had been investigated by the national intelligence agency .\nHe responded bitterly to recent comments by Abbott that migrants who moved to Australia should be willing to join \u201c Team Australia. \u201d \u201c Shame on Team Australia and shame on those racist and terrorist Australians who support the governments of America and its allies including Australia , \u201d Haron said on Facebook , before his page was taken down late Monday .\nHe described his Facebook page as \u201c Team Islam against Australian oppression and terrorism. \u201d Monis also posted a letter on his Facebook page attacking Abbott over Australia \u2019 s military involvement in Afghanistan , saying this had made the world -- and Australia -- more dangerous .\nHis website bears a photograph of a dead woman and three children , all bleeding , with the words : \u201c This is an evidence for the terrorism of America and its allies including Australia .\nThis result of their air strikes. \u201d Monis accused the \u201c barbaric \u201d Australians of torture and last week praised the Islamic State over its actions in Iraq and Syria .\nIran condemned the hostage-taking incident .\n\u201c Any terrorist action to tarnish the compassionate image of Islam is condemned , \u201d Marziyeh Afkham , the spokeswoman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said .\nA psychoanalysis of the suspect has been sent to Australian officials , she said .\nThe drama in Sydney began around 9:45 a.m. Monday in Martin Place , a plaza in the capital \u2019 s financial and shopping district .\nThe area was packed with holiday shoppers as well as workers from nearby buildings taking a midmorning break .\nThe cafe is not far from courts , the parliament of New South Wales state , the U.S. Consulate and the Reserve Bank of Australia .\nOnce the siege began , businesses and courts in the neighborhood were evacuated and closed for the day .\nThe iconic Sydney Opera House , less than a mile away , also was evacuated .\nAside from the chop-chop sound of helicopters overhead , there was an eerie quiet , pierced with the sound of sirens .\nSurrounding streets were filled with police cars , ambulances and fire trucks .\nAbbott confirmed late Monday local time that the gunman appeared to have \u201c a political motivation , \u201d and local media reported that the gunman was trying to obtain an Islamic State flag in exchange for some of the hostages .\nTwo people inside the cafe had been seen pressed up against the window holding a black flag with Arabic writing early in the siege .\nThe flag appeared to say : \u201c There is no god but Allah , and Muhammad is the messenger of God. \u201d As the day wore on , Australia \u2019 s Network Ten Eyewitness News reported that two female hostages in the cafe had phoned the station and spoken of two bombs planted in the cafe and two other bombs elsewhere in downtown Sydney .\nPolice declined to confirm that .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t speculate on what may or may not be , and that would be very unhelpful at the moment , \u201d Deputy Police Commissioner Catherine Burn said at an evening news conference .\n\u201c At the moment we know that the person we are dealing with is armed. \u201d The women were \u201c hysterical \u201d and believed that their lives were in immediate danger , according to the network .\nThe hostages also conveyed the demands of the gunman , who called himself \u201c The Brother , \u201d according to the network : to speak to Abbott and to have an Islamic State flag delivered to the cafe .\nIn return for the flag , one hostage would be freed , they reportedly said .\nThe network said on Twitter that police listened in to the network \u2019 s talks with the hostages , and \u201c advised every step of the way. \u201d Burn declined to call the incident a terrorist act .\n\u201c We still don \u2019 t know what the motivation might be , \u201d she said , adding that authorities \u201c want to resolve this peacefully. \u201d But authorities in New South Wales did call up the local counter terrorism unit , Task Force Pioneer .\n\u201c This is really about setting up command and control , \u201d Burn said .\nThe attack came the same day police filed terror charges against two men , one accused of terror financing .\nBoth had been arrested in Australia \u2019 s biggest series of terror raids in Sydney and Brisbane in September ; one had been freed but was rearrested Monday .\nPolice said there was no connection between the morning arrests and the siege , Fairfax media reported .\nBooth , a special correspondent , reported from Sydney and Dixon from Kenya .\nStaff writers Michael Muskal and Lauren Raab in Los Angeles contributed to this report ."}

{"label": true, "txt": "3 Dead After Police Storm Sydney Caf\u00e9 to End Hostage CrisisHeavily armed police in Australia stormed a Sydney caf\u00e9 where a gunman had held more than a dozen people hostage early Tuesday , ending a tense standoff that lasted more than 16 hours and saw at least three people die , including the gunman .\nPolice could be seen entering the caf\u00e9 at about 2:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday , after a gunman held at 17 people in the central business district of Australia \u2019 s largest city .\nGunshots could be heard ringing out on video feeds from the scene , and local media reports indicated injuries were sustained by both hostages and police .\nThe gunman died in the police raid , authorities said , and he was identified as Man Haron Monis , an Iranian-born man and a self-described cleric who has been on authorities \u2019 radar in the past .\nA chaotic scene unfolded as police raided the caf\u00e9 , with hostages running outside and an officer carrying out at least one ailing hostage .\nNew South Wales Premier Mike Baird said the gunman had carried out \u201c horrendous vicious attacks. \u201d \u201c We are a peaceful society which is the envy of the world , \u201d he said in a televised news conference .\n\u201c Today we must come together like never before. \u201d Two hostages died , five escaped and six were uninjured , police said .\nAt least one police officer suffered a minor gunshot wound to the face , but was alive .\nPolice wouldn \u2019 t say whether the hostages were killed by the gunman or in crossfire during the raid , the Associated Press reports .\n\u201c They believed if they didn \u2019 t enter there would have been many more lives lost , \u201d New South Wales Police commissioner Andrew Scipione said of the officers \u2019 decision to raid the caf\u00e9 .\n\u201c Events that were unfolding inside of the premises led them to the belief that now was the time to deploy. \u201d It started Monday morning , when hostages were seen displaying a black-and-white flag in the window of the Lindt caf\u00e9 in Martin Place \u2014 a major commercial precinct usually crowded with office workers and tourists and , at this time of year , Christmas shoppers .\nThe flag bore , in Arabic text , what was thought to be the shahada , or Muslim testimony of faith .\nThe flag , which is commonly flown by Islamist terrorist groups , sparked fears that a terrorist attack was unfolding .\nBut Sydney police had not said if it is a terrorist attack , and an official later described it as an \u201c isolated incident. \u201d Authorities confirmed earlier they had made contact with the perpetrator and were in negotiations .\nSeveral hostages had left the scene late Monday before the chaos that unfolded early Tuesday .\nU.S. President Barack Obama was briefed overnight on the crisis .\n\u201c This is a very disturbing incident , \u201d Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a televised address earlier Monday .\n\u201c It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation .\n\u201c We are a free , open and generous people , and today we have responded to this in character , \u201d he added .\n\u201c Yes , it has been a difficult day .\nYes , it has been a day which has tested us , but so far , like Australians in all sorts of situations , we have risen to the challenge. \u201d Australia \u2019 s paramount figure on Islamic law , the Grand Mufti Ibrahim Abu Mohamed , issued a statement \u201c unequivocally \u201d condemning the action .\nHe said the Muslim community was \u201c devastated \u201d by the incident and said such actions are \u201c denounced in part and in whole in Islam. \u201d Buildings in the area , including the famed Sydney Opera House and the U.S. consulate , had been evacuated , with office workers taken to nearby Hyde Park .\nMartin Place train station , one of Sydney \u2019 s busiest , was closed , as were major nearby roads .\n\u201c Sometimes here in Australia you think something like this would never happen so it \u2019 s pretty shocking to see , \u201d Kristina Ryan , who works nearby at Circular Quay , said Monday .\n\u201c It \u2019 s been really frustrating with the lack of information and how much longer can they expect us to just sit here without understanding why this is happening ?\nI think that \u2019 s really adding to the fear people are feeling in the city. \u201d Ryan said that fear was amplified as she and her co-workers watched as authorities evacuated the Opera House .\n\u201c There are lots of government buildings around .\nIt \u2019 s a very busy place , especially on a Monday morning , \u201d Clarke Jones , a terrorism expert at the Australian National University \u2019 s College of Asia and the Pacific , tells TIME .\nThe unfolding hostage crisis comes more than two months after Australian authorities foiled a terrorist plot by local supporters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria ( ISIS ) , who were reportedly planning to behead members of the public in Martin Place .\nDays later , on Sept. 21 , forces affiliated with ISIS released a 42-minute audio recording calling on followers to attack non-Muslims in Australia .\nThe call to arms appears to have been made in retaliation for Canberra \u2019 s deployment of military personnel and fighter jets to the Middle East to fight in the international coalition against ISIS and al-Qaeda-affiliated groups in Syria and Iraq .\nAccording to Jones , officials believe that up to 60 Australian nationals and residents are currently fighting in jihadist ranks in the Middle East .\nDozens are believed to have already returned to Australia .\n\u201c They haven \u2019 t been prosecuted , but we don \u2019 t know at this stage if they \u2019 ve come back with an added intent to continue the fight here in Australia , \u201d says Jones .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard to know. \u201d As darkness fell on Monday evening , a crowd of around 200 people remained milling around the scene .\n\u201c Everyone was quite calm , \u201d says Victor Domni , who works at Macquarie Bank directly across from the Lindt caf\u00e9 and was among the first to be evacuated this morning .\n\u201c I wasn \u2019 t in a position to do anymore work so I was ready to go home .\nI \u2019 m quite hesitant to go into work tomorrow because it \u2019 s quite scary. \u201d \u201c We \u2019 ve seen this on the news happening in other places and it \u2019 s finally hit home so it \u2019 s a bit shocking , \u201d he adds .\nAbbott urged his fellow Australians to remain coolheaded .\n\u201c The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves .\nAustralia is a peaceful , open and generous society , \u201d he said on Monday morning .\n\u201c Nothing should ever change that. \u201d \u2014 With reporting

most likely , this was arson .\nThe very same night , many miles away in North Carolina , another church burned : Briar Creek Road Baptist Church , which was set on fire some time around 1 a.m. Investigators have ruled it an act of arson , the AP reports ; according to The Charlotte Observer , they haven \u2019 t yet determined whether it might be a hate crime .\nTwo other predominantly black churches have been the target of possible arson in the past fornight : Glover Grove Missionary Baptist Church in Warrenville , South Carolina , which caught fire on Friday , and College Hill Seventh Day Adventist , which burned on Monday in Knoxville , Tennessee .\nInvestigators in Knoxville told a local news station they believed it was an act of vandalism , although they aren \u2019 t investigating the incident as a hate crime .\n( There have also been at least four other cases of fires at churches in the past fortnight .\nAt Fruitland Presbyterian Church in Gibson County , Tennessee , and the Greater Miracle Temple Apostolic Holiness Church in Tallahassee , Florida , officials suspect the blazes were caused by lightning and electrical wires , respectively , but investigations are still ongoing .\nA church that is not predominantly black\u2014College Heights Baptist Church in Elyria , Ohio\u2014was burned on Saturday morning .\nThe fire appears to have been started in the sanctuary , and WKYC reports that the cause is still under investigation .\nThe town \u2019 s fire and police departments did not immediately return calls for confirmation on Sunday .\n* And a Monday , June 29 , fire at Disciples of Christ Ministries in Jackson , Mississippi , was ruled accidental . )\nThese fires join the murder of nine people at Charleston \u2019 s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church as major acts of violence perpetrated against predominantly black churches in the last fortnight .\nChurches are burning again in the United States , and the symbolism of that is powerful .\nEven though many instances of arson have happened at white churches , the crime is often association with racial violence : a highly visible attack on a core institution of the black community , often done at night , and often motivated by hate .\nAs my colleague David Graham noted last week , the history of American church burnings dates to before the Civil War , but there was a major uptick in incidents of arson at black churches in the middle and late 20th century .\nOne of the most famous was the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham , Alabama , which killed four girls .\nThree decades later , cases of church arson rose sharply .\nIn response , in 1995 , President Bill Clinton also set up a church-arson investigative task force , and in 1996 , Congress passed a law increasing the sentences for arsonists who target religious organizations , particularly for reasons of race or ethnicity .\nBetween 1995 and 1999 , Clinton \u2019 s task force reported that it opened 827 investigations into burnings and bombings at houses of worship ; it was later disbanded .\nIn recent years , it \u2019 s been harder to get a clear sense of the number of church fires across the country .\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports that between 2007 and 2011 , there were an average of 280 intentionally set fires at houses of worship in America each year , although a small percentage of those took place at other religious organizations , like funeral homes .\nOne of the organization \u2019 s staffers , Marty Ahrens , said that tracking church arson has become much more complicated since reporting standards changed in the late \u2018 90s .\nSometimes , fires that are reported to the National Fire Incident Reporting System are considered \u201c suspicious , \u201d but they can \u2019 t be reported as arson until they \u2019 re definitively ruled \u201c intentional. \u201d Even then , it \u2019 s difficult to determine what motivated an act of arson .\n\u201c To know that something is motivated by hate , you either have to know who did it or they have to leave you a message in some way that makes it very obvious , \u201d she said .\n\u201c There are an awful lot of [ intentionally set fires ] that are not hate crimes\u2014they \u2019 re run-of-the-mill kids doing stupid things. \u201d The investigations in North Carolina , Georgia , South Carolina , Florida , Ohio , and Tennessee are still ongoing , and they may end up in that broad category of fires of suspicious , but ultimately unknowable , origin that Ahrens described .\nBut no matter why they happened , these fires are a troubling reminder of the vulnerability of our sacred institutions in the days following one of the most violent attacks on a church in recent memory .\nIt \u2019 s true that a stupid kid might stumble backward into one of the most symbolically terrifying crimes possible in the United States , but that doesn \u2019 t make the terror of churches burning any less powerful ."}

after it found traces of the carcinogen in children \u2019 s crayons and toy crime lab kits .\nFour of 28 boxes of crayons tested positive for asbestos , according to the newly released report from the advocacy group .\nA private lab hired by the EWG Action Fund , a sister organization of the Environmental Working Group , also detected and confirmed asbestos in two of 21 toy crime lab kits it evaluated .\nBreathing in microscopic asbestos fibers has been linked to serious health problems , including lung disease , lung cancer and mesothelioma .\nThe Environmental Protection Agency says exposure to asbestos only occurs when asbestos-containing material is disturbed , and when the particles become airborne .\n\u201c Parents do need to be concerned about particular brands of products where asbestos was identified , \u201d said Dr. Jerry Paulson , the former chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2019 Council on Environmental Health .\nPackage labels indicated that the crayons and toys containing asbestos were made in China and imported to the United States , according to the report .\nAffected crayon boxes included Amscan Crayons purchased at Party City as well as Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse , Nickelodeon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Crayons and Saban \u2019 s Power Rangers Super Megaforce boxes purchased at Dollar Tree .\nThe two toy crime lab kits with contaminants included the black fingerprint powder in the Edu Science Deluxe Forensics Lab Kit , purchased at ToysRUs.com , and the white fingerprint powder from the Inside Intelligence Secret Spy kit , purchased on Amazon.com .\nHowever , the EWG Action Fund report does not list the amount of asbestos found in the products .\nPaulson , who is not affiliated with the report , said that powder from the crime lab kits was of particular concern .\n\u201c Powders make this material much more available to the lung , where asbestos does its damage , \u201d Paulson said .\n\u2018 Child safety is of the utmost importance \u2019 CNN contacted importers , distributors and retailers named in the report for comment .\nRepresentatives from Amazon , MII Inc. and Buy-Rite could not be reached .\nThe report specifies that \u201c product names may be licensed and do not necessarily reflect the name of the manufacturer. \u201d The vice president of investor relations for Dollar Tree , which owns Greenbrier International Inc. , an importer and distributor named in the report , released a statement : \u201c The safety of our customers is paramount and we work constantly to ensure our suppliers \u2019 products are compliant and safe .\nTo that end , we have a very robust and stringent test program , which includes working with independent CPSC-accredited testing companies to ensure our suppliers \u2019 products meet all safety and legal standards. \u201d A spokesperson for Party City , which is owned by Amscan , said in a statement : \u201c Amscan is dedicated to ensuring that all of its products meet or exceed federal , state and municipal requirements .\nTo this end , Amscan conducts compliance testing of its suppliers \u2019 products by using nationally recognized product testing organizations .\nAny product that fails to meet governmental or Amscan \u2019 s standards will not be distributed or sold .\nWe take these types of matters very seriously and are investigating further. \u201d Toys R Us spokeswoman Kathleen Waugh said in a statement : \u201c The safety of our customers is , and always has been , our highest priority .\nWe take this responsibility very seriously .\nWe require that every product we carry meets or exceeds all applicable state and federal laws , industry standards , codes and requirements .\nAt this time , we are reviewing the referenced report , along with supplier test reports , to ensure full compliance to our strict safety standards. \u201d The Consumer Product Safety Commission \u201c takes the issue raised in the EWG report seriously , and CPSC staff is going to follow up in regards to the product that the EWG identified in their report , \u201d Scott Wolfson , communications director for the CPSC , told CNN .\n\u201c Child safety is of the utmost importance to CPSC , and we have looked into the issue of asbestos in crayons and possibly being in fingerprint kits in the past .\nThe agency has advised manufacturers in the past to not use any chemicals or any materials that could put a child \u2019 s health at risk .\nAnd we will once again look at the products that have been identified in this new report. \u201d Histories of contamination While reports of asbestos in children \u2019 s toys aren \u2019 t common , this isn \u2019 t the first time kids \u2019 products have tested positive for asbestos .\nThe EWG Action Fund conducted its study as a follow-up to earlier investigations , the report \u2019 s co-author , Sonya Lunder , told CNN .\nIn 2000 , the Seattle Post-Intelligencer found asbestos in crayons , and the nonprofit Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization found asbestos in a toy fingerprint exam kit in 2007 .\n\u201c It is really shocking to have had these two reports previously raise attention to the issue ( and ) have manufacturers pledge to pay more attention and to see there are still products on the shelf that have talc , which is contaminated with asbestos in many cases , \u201d Lunder said .\nThe CPSC found that in the case of the 2000 report , the amount of asbestos in the crayons was so small it was \u201c scientifically insignificant. \u201d For its recent report , the EWG Action Fund purchased crayons and toy crime lab kits at national retail chains near San Francisco or at online retailers between February and May 2015 .\nThe Scientific Analytical Institute in Greensboro , North Carolina , conducted the product testing , according to the report .\nThe group also tested sidewalk chalk from two retailers ; no asbestos was found .\nThe report said three types of asbestos \u2013 tremolite , chrysotile and anthophyllite \u2013 were found in the children \u2019 s products .\nThe asbestos was probably a contaminant of talc , which can be used as a binding agent in the crayons and in powder in the toy crime lab kits .\nAccording to the report , asbestos is often found in mines alongside talc deposits .\nA push to change policy Unlike regulations governing lead in children \u2019 s toys , Congress has not passed any laws pertaining to asbestos in children \u2019 s products , the CPSC \u2019 s Wolfson said .\nIn 1989 , the Environmental Protection Agency issued a ban on most asbestos-containing products .\nHowever , this regulation was overturned in 1991 , leaving bans on only a few products .\nToday , products containing asbestos that could be inhaled are required to be labeled , according to the CPSC .\nAsbestos that might release fibers is most often found in building products and insulation materials used before the 1970s .\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration lists \u201c asbestos-containing material \u201d as any material containing more than 1 % asbestos .\nThe EWG \u2019 s Lunder said that \u2019 s not a tough enough standard for health .\n\u201c This is an avoidable risk .\nThis is a known carcinogen and our risk standard or threshold for exposure to cancer-causing chemicals in ( kids \u2019 ) toys should be zero , \u201d Lunder said .\nThe EWG Action Fund is calling for regulatory and policy changes and says there \u2019 s a need for sensitive methods to detect asbestos and asbestos-like fibers in consumer products .\nIt also wants to see talc banned from children \u2019 s products such as crayons , fingerprint kits and chalk .\n\u201c We can \u2019 t fight this battle one toy and one company at a time , \u201d Lunder said .\n\u201c We need to think bigger and need to ensure that protections are permanent. \u201d Paulson , the pediatrician , also supports additional regulatory action , especially as it has become a recurring issue .\n\u201c This issue of asbestos in toys , in particular in crayons , is a problem , \u201d Paulson said .\n\u201c That was identified 15 years ago .\n\u201c The current voluntary standard for protecting children from toxic substances doesn \u2019 t work .\nIf we \u2019 re going to protect kids , we need to use science and ban substances such as asbestos , where we know there is a huge risk to small exposure . \u201d"}

Peninsula link to the Charlie Hebdo magazine attack , Mohammed Albasha , Yemen \u2019 s spokesman in Washington , tweeted Friday .\n\u2022 Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for orchestrating the deadly terrorist attack on the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo , the founder of the magazine The Intercept , Jeremy Scahill , told CNN .\nCNN has not independently confirmed this claim .\n\u2022 Four hostages were killed and 15 survived in the standoff between an armed terrorist and police at a Paris kosher grocery store on Friday , according to Israeli government sources who characterized a phone conversation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande .\n\u2022 U.S. President Barack Obama said he wants the people of France to know that the United States \u201c stands with you today , stands with you tomorrow \u201d after this week \u2019 s terror .\nHe told a crowd in Tennessee that \u201c we stand for freedom

United States discussing the Paris terrorist attack this week and the sophistication of the tactics , a U.S. law enforcement source told CNN .\nThe bulletin says the attacks demonstrated \u201c a degree of sophistication and training traditionally not seen in recent small armed attacks , \u201d the official said .\n\u2022 A man claiming to be Amedy Coulibaly , the suspected hostage-taker at the Paris grocery store , told CNN affiliate BFMTV that he belonged to the Islamist militant group ISIS .\nCNN can not independently confirm the authenticity of the recording .\nCharlie Hebdo attackers holed up in print shop The day \u2019 s drama began in Dammartin-en-Goele , where brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi ended up in a print shop in an industrial area .\nA salesman , who identified himself only as Didier , told France Info radio that he shook one of the gunman \u2019 s hands at about 8:30 a.m. as they arrived at the business .\nDidier said he first thought the man , who was dressed in black and heavily armed , was a police officer .\nAs he left , the armed man said , \u201c Go , we don \u2019 t kill civilians. \u201d Didier said , \u201c It wasn \u2019 t normal .\nI did not know what was going on. \u201d The gunmen told police that they wanted to die as martyrs , Yves Albarello , who is in France \u2019 s Parliament , said on channel iTele .\nThe area , meanwhile , was locked down \u2013 with children stuck in schools , roads closed and shops shuttered .\nShortly before 5 p.m. , gunshots and at least three large explosions pierced the relative silence .\n.\nSoon after , men could be seen on the roof of the building where the brothers had holed up .\nFour helicopters landed nearby .\nWord came that the brothers were dead and that a man who had been hiding in the building was safe , said Bernard Corneille , the mayor of nearby Othis .\nHostages at kosher grocery store At the same time , in a different setting near Paris \u2019 s Porte de Vincennes about 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) away , a similar crisis played out at a kosher store .\nAmedy Coulibaly \u2013 the same man who , authorities said , is suspected with Hayat Boumeddiene of killing a policewoman Thursday south of Paris \u2013 on Friday took a number of hostages there .\nBoumeddiene remains at large .\nLike Cherif Kouachi , a man claiming to be Coulibaly called BFMTV on Friday .\nAt the scene , witnesses heard Coulibaly demand freedom for the Kouachi brothers , according to police union spokesman Pascal Disand .\nLaw enforcement swarmed the area .\nDozens of schools went on lockdown .\nA resolution came a few minutes after the Dammartin-en-Goele climax , in the form of explosions and gunfire .\nUp to 20 heavily armed police officers moved into the store .\nThey came out with a number of civilians .\nNot everyone made it .\nHollande said four people were killed .\nIsraeli government sources told CNN that Hollande told Netanyahu that four hostages were killed and 15 were rescued .\nMolins said four hostages were killed by the gunman before police stormed the market .\nFather : \u2018 It \u2019 s like a war \u2019 In a speech Friday night , Hollande called the Porte de Vincennes deaths an \u201c anti-Semitic \u201d act .\nHe urged his countrymen not to respond with violence against Muslims , saying , \u201c Those who committed these acts have nothing to do with the Muslim religion. \u201d \u201c Unity \u201d he said , \u201c is our best weapon. \u201d Map : Standoffs near Paris , France That kind of military language is apt when you \u2019 re talking about two deadly attacks and violent standoffs in a few days .\nIt \u2019 s something that a man , who asked to be called simply Teddy , understands .\nHe was outside Henri Dunant elementary school in Dammartin-en-Goele on Friday , hoping to pick up his young son .\nAnd , eventually , the students did leave the school \u2013 accompanied by police officers who held their hands and , in some cases , lifted them onto an awaiting bus that would take them to safety .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like a war , \u201d Teddy said .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know how I will explain this to my 5-year-old son. \u201d Parts of France on high alert This \u201c war \u201d erupted two days ago , when a pair of heavily armed men \u2013 hooded and dressed in black \u2013 entered the Paris offices of Charlie Hebdo , the satirical magazine known for its provocative , often profane , take on religion , politics and most anything else .\nSatirical magazine is no stranger to controversy They burst into a meeting , called out individuals , and then executed them .\nThe dead included editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier and four other well-known cartoonists known by the pen names : Cabu , Wolinski , Honore and Tignous .\nAuthorities followed a lead Thursday morning from a gas station attendant near Villers-Cotterets , about 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) from Dammartin-en-Goele , whom Cherif Kouachi , 32 , and Said Kouachi , 34 , reportedly threatened as they stole food and gas .\nPolice think the brothers may have later fled on foot into nearby woods .\nTies to Islamist extremists As the suspects moved , the French government \u2013 including more than 80,000 police deployed across the country \u2013 also didn \u2019 t stand still .\nSome of them tried to prevent more bloodshed , which might have something to do with nine people detained after the Charlie Hebdo attacks .\nInvestigators also dug to learn about the attackers .\nWho are the suspects ?\nBoth men had ties to Islamist extremists .\nSaid Kouachi , left , and Cherif Kouachi are suspects in the Paris attack .\nFrench National Police/AFP/Getty Images Said , the elder of the Kouachi brothers , spent several months in Yemen in 2011 , receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , according to U.S. officials .\nHis younger brother , Cherif , has a long history of jihad and anti-Semitism , according to documents obtained by CNN .\nIn a 400-page court record , he is described as wanting to go to Iraq through Syria \u201c to go and combat the Americans. \u201d \u201c I was ready to go and die in battle , \u201d he said in a deposition .\n\u201c \u2026 I got this idea when I saw the injustices shown by television .\n\u2026 I am speaking about the torture that the Americans have inflicted on the Iraqis. \u201d Cherif was a close associate of Coulibaly , a Western intelligence source told CNN .\nA man claiming to be Cherif told CNN affiliate BFMTV in a phone call before he was shot and killed Friday that he was sent to carry out the massacre by al Qaeda in Yemen and that the late Anwar al-Awlaki financed his trip .\nCNN can not independently confirm the authenticity of the recording .\nAl-Awlaki , an American-born Muslim scholar and cleric who acted as a spokesperson for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , was killed in 2011 by a CIA drone strike .\nCherif and Coulibaly were involved in a 2010 attempt to free an Algerian incarcerated for a 1995 subway bombing .\nCoulibaly was arrested with 240 rounds of ammunition for a Kalashnikov rifle and a photo of Djamel Beghal , a French Algerian once known as al Qaeda \u2019 s premier European recruiter .\nThe Western intelligence source said that Coulibaly lived with Boumeddiene , his alleged accomplice in the police shooting , and that the two traveled to Malaysia together .\nCharlie Hebdo columnist : \u2018 They didn \u2019 t want us to be quiet \u2019 A unity rally will be held Sunday \u201c celebrating the

{"label": true, "txt": "\u2018 I Do \u2019 as I Say , Not as I DoFACT CHECK : Has Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis , who refused to issue any marriage licenses after the June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court marriage equality decision , herself been married four times ?\nClaim : Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis , who refused to issue any marriage licenses after the June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court marriage equality decision , has herself been married four times .\nTRUE Origins : In a 7 July 2015 Facebook status update , user David V. Moore uploaded the video embedded below ( `` Denied marriage license in Morehead , KY \u2014 Rowan County '' ) and wrote of it : We were denied a marriage license on Monday , July 6 at the Rowan County Clerk 's office .\nKim Davis is at the end of the video , but we turned it off at her request .\nShortly afterwards , the related meme seen at the head of this page began circulating via social media .\nFeaturing a still image captured from the video , the meme asserts that the Rowan County employee in question ( Kim Davis ) denied Moore and his male partner a marriage license but had herself been married four times , a piece of information included in many iterations of the rumor : @ voxdotcom I read elsewhere that Kim Davis has been married four times .\nHer 'religious objection ' is looking a little thin .\n\u2014 Alex Hartmann ( @ jeshakeoma ) July 8 , 2015 Prior to the appearance of Moore 's video , Davis ' name had appeared in headlines and news articles .\nOn 2 July 2015 she was quoted in a Lexington Herald-Reader article about her being sued by four other couples , two same-sex and two opposite-sex , whom she refused to issue marriage licenses to : Four couples [ have ] sued Rowan County and its clerk , Kim Davis , for refusing to issue marriage licenses because of Davis ' religious objections to the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage .\nDavis is obligated by law to issue a marriage license to all qualified applicants , which now includes same-sex couples , the plaintiffs said .\nBy `` promoting a particular religious belief '' at the Rowan County courthouse , Davis has `` acted maliciously , with callous disregard for , or with reckless indifference to , the clearly established rights '' of the plaintiffs , they said .\nDavis , a Democratic county clerk who took office in January [ 2015 ] , did not return a call seeking comment .\nIn interviews earlier this week , she said her Christian beliefs prevented her from giving marriage licenses to same-sex couples , despite the Supreme Court 's ruling , so she no longer would issue a license to anyone .\n`` I disagree with the way this was all handed down , '' Davis told the Herald-Leader .\n`` As much as the same-sex couples feel they have a right to marry , I feel the institution of marriage was ordained by God in the Bible .\nIt 's a hard place to find yourself , especially in a situation like mine .\nBut I have to do what I think is right for my conscience . ''\nIn Kentucky , it 's a Class A misdemeanor \u2014 first-degree official misconduct \u2014 for elected officials to refuse to perform the duties of their office .\nThe earliest mention of Davis ' marital status we turned up was a now-deleted 5 July 2015 Daily Kos diary entry titled `` A view from Rowan County , KY. '' When or why that post was removed is not clear , but a cached version of it included the following statement : Chat outside the courthouse among the protesters says that Ms. Davis , the County Clerk , is on her fourth marriage , though nobody thinks that diminishes her faith .\nHer mother held the post for some years ; her son serves as her assistant .\nThat 's not mean , angry conversation .\nIt 's a headshake from people who know her and are sorry it has come to this .\n( The same chat says at least one employee is gay , and so the county may be looking at a hostile work environment . )\nA 9 July 2015 report from Lexington station WKYT on David Moore 's video noted the rumor that Kim Davis had herself been married four times and stated that her marriage certificate ( s ) confirmed that fact : The Associated Press also confirmed in September 2015 that court records document Davis has a marital history encompassing four marriages ( to three different men ) and bore two children outside of wedlock : Court records detail Kim Davis ' turbulent marital history : She has been married to her current husband twice , with a divorce and another husband in between .\nShe married her first husband , Dwain Wallace , when she was 18 , and divorced him in 1994 .\nShe acknowledged in a 2008 divorce filing having had two children in 1994 while she was not married .\nIn 1996 , at age 30 , she married Joe Davis for the first time .\nThey divorced in 2006 .\nThe next year , at 40 years old , Davis wed Thomas McIntryre , though their marriage lasted less than a year .\nShe re-married Joe Davis in 2009 .\nOf this dissonance between her personal background and her expressed beliefs and actions , Davis said that : In federal court , Davis testified that her objection to issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples was not based on any sin she thinks the couple might commit .\nShe said it was based on the Biblical definition of marriage as \u201c a union between one man and one woman. \u201d That \u2019 s different from giving licenses to people who have been divorced , she said .\nThe Bible prohibits divorce in most cases , but Davis said , \u201c That \u2019 s between them and God. \u201d Last updated : 14 September 2015 First published : 9 July 2015"}

{"label": true, "txt": "No Guns for Pensioners ? NEWS : President Obama is reportedly pushing to extend gun background checks to Social Security disability recipients .\nClaim : President Obama is planning to ban all Social Security recipients from owning guns .\nMIXTURE WHAT 'S TRUE : The Obama administration is seeking to use Social Security Administration data about disability recipients to enforce existing gun purchase restrictions .\nWHAT 'S FALSE : President Obama is planning to bar all Social Security recipients from owning guns .\nOrigins : In a case reminiscent of a January 2009 piece of satire , July 2015 news reports indicated that the Obama administration was seeking tighter controls over firearm purchases by pushing to bar Social Security beneficiaries from owning guns if they lack the mental capacity to manage their own affairs .\nThe move is being tagged as part of an effort by the Obama administration to strengthen gun control after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting , a plan that includes trying to plug holes in the firearms purchase background check system .\nThe intent of the Social Security check is to bring the Social Security Administration in line with other laws that regulate who gets reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) , a database used to prevent gun sales to excluded classes such as felons , drug addicts , dishonorably discharged service members , fugitives , and illegal immigrants .\n( That is , the Obama administration is n't seeking to create new classes of persons excluded from gun ownership \u2014 those exclusions already exist , and the administration is only positing the use of Social Security Administration reporting as a method of enforcing them . )\nSuch a move could potentially affect millions of Social Security disability recipients whose payments are handled by others due to `` marked subnormal intelligence , or mental illness , incompetency , condition , or disease . ''\nThose persons would likely be identified through the reporting of anyone who has been declared incompetent to manage their own pension or disability payments and has been assigned a fiduciary as a result .\nOpponents of the plan maintain that the implementation of such a background check system could unfairly exclude large numbers of people who pose no real danger to others from gun ownership : Critics \u2014 including gun rights activists , mental health experts and advocates for the disabled \u2014 say that expanding the list of prohibited gun owners based on financial competence is wrongheaded .\nThough such a ban would keep at least some people who pose a danger to themselves or others from owning guns , the strategy undoubtedly would also include numerous people who may just have a bad memory or difficulty balancing a checkbook , the critics argue .\n`` Someone can be incapable of managing their funds but not be dangerous , violent or unsafe , '' said Dr. Marc Rosen , a Yale psychiatrist who has studied how veterans with mental health problems manage their money .\n`` They are very different determinations . ''\nRosen said some [ people ] may avoid seeking help for mental health problems out of fear that they would be required to give up their guns .\nAri Ne'eman , a member of the National Council on Disability , said the independent federal agency would oppose any policy that used assignment of a representative payee as a basis to take any fundamental right from people with disabilities .\n`` The rep payee is an extraordinarily broad brush , '' he said .\nThe federal background check system was created in 1993 through the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act ( named after White House Press Secretary James Brady , who was severely wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan ) and requires gun stores to check the names of prospective buyers through the system before every sale .\nThe database holds over 13 million records , entered at the local , state , and federal level , but it has not always served its intended purpose due to inconsistencies in reporting and use \u2014 for example , when Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people after the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting , it was later found that he had been declared mentally ill by a court and ordered to undergo treatment , but the law in effect at the time did not require that he be added to the database .\nA similar system already in use by the VA for beneficiaries has drawn similar criticisms : The VA reports names under a category in gun control regulations known as `` adjudicated as a mental defective , '' terminology that derives from decades-old laws .\nIts only criterion is whether somebody has been appointed a fiduciary .\nMore than half of the names on the VA list are of people 80 or older , often suffering from dementia , a reasonable criterion for prohibiting gun ownership .\nBut the category also includes anybody found by a `` court , board , commission or other lawful authority '' to be lacking `` the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs '' for a wide variety of reasons .\nThe agency 's efforts have been criticized by a variety of groups .\nSocial Security would generally report names under the same `` mental defective '' category .\nThe agency is still figuring out how that definition should be applied .\nAbout 2.7 million people are now receiving disability payments from Social Security for mental health problems , a potentially higher risk category for gun ownership .\nAn addition 1.5 million have their finances handled by others for a variety of reasons .\nSince 2008 , VA beneficiaries have been able to get off the list by filing an appeal and demonstrating that they pose no danger to themselves or others .\nBut as of April [ 2015 ] , just nine of 298 appeals have been granted , according to data provided by the VA. Thirteen others were pending , and 44 were withdrawn after the VA overturned its determination of financial incompetence ."}

'\nARE PARIS GUNMEN FROM YEMENI AL QAEDA CELL BEHIND PLANE BOMB PLOTS IN THE U.S. AND BRITAIN ?\nThe gunmen being hunted by police over the Charlie Hebdo attack are believed to be from militant group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) .\nThe group was established by Yusef al-Ayeri in 2003 in Saudi Arabia , but was forced to flee to Yemen after a series of attacks drove them back .\nYemen 's weak government allowed the group to rally and gain members , though they are only thought to have around 400 troops today .\nWhile their attacks initially focused on targets in the Middle East , such as an attempted suicide attack on Saudi Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef , they quickly spread to Western targets .\nOn Christmas Day in 2009 , they were implicated in the underwear bomb plot after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was discovered on a Detroit-bound plane trying to detonate liquid explosives in his underpants .\nThe following year AQAP also took responsibility for a plot to blow up two devices hidden inside printer cartridges loaded on to cargo planes travelling from Yemen to the United States .\nOne device was discovered during a stopover at East Midlands Airport in Britain , while another was uncovered in Dubai .\nAccording to Stanford University the group is currently lead by Yemen-born Nasser al-Wuhayshi , who is an apprentice of Osama Bin Laden and was imprisoned for a time in Yemen , but escaped in 2006 along with 22 others .\nThe group has a global jihadist agenda .\nLike ISIS , they aim to create a single Arab caliphate , covering Pakistan Afghanistan , Iraq , Yemen and the Levant - the area encompassing Lebanon , Jordan , Syria and Israel .\nIf yesterday 's attack is confirmed as coming from AQAP , it will be the first time the group has used lone-wolf style tactics , in which gunmen act alone or in small groups to attack targets .\nBenoit Bringer , a journalist with Agence Premiere Ligne , told the iTele network he saw several masked men armed with machine guns Carnage : A police official , Luc Poignant , said he was aware of one journalist dead and several injured , including three police officers The New York Times reported that a journalist at the Charlie Hebdo office , who asked not to be named , texted a friend after the attack to say : ' I 'm alive .\n'There is death all around me .\nYes , I am there .\nThe jihadists spared me . '\nAnother witness , Gilles Boulanger , who works in the same building , told Itele : ' A neighbour called to warn me that there were armed men in the building and that we had to shut all the doors .\n'And several minutes later , there were several shots heard in the building from automatic weapons firing in all directions .\n'So then we looked out of the window and saw the shooting was on Boulevard Richard-Lenoir , with the police .\nIt was really upsetting .\nYou 'd think it was a war zone .

'\nAn unnamed eyewitness told the BBC World Service : 'When I arrived at the scene it was quite disturbing as you can imagine .\nThere were several corpses on the floor .\n'We saw the number of casualties was very high , so we just tried to help as we could - there were a lot of people down on the floor and there was blood everywhere .\n' I 'm very traumatised by this attack and everything and now we 're in psychological hell where we 're being attended to by professionals .

we have to win the security war against it and contain it , otherwise big trouble lies ahead .\nLocation : Officers were involved in a gunfight with the men , who escaped in a hijacked car and sped away from the office towards east Paris 'We have to be stand strong with the international community ' : A visibly shocked French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande arrives at the scene , where he promised to bring those responsible to justice '100 LASHES IF YOU DO N'T DIE OF LAUGHTER ' : HOW CHARLIE HEBDO HAS BECOME A BYWORD FOR ANTI-ISLAMISM Charlie Hebdo has become a byword for offensive statements in France after taking several highly provocative swipes at Islam .\nThe newspaper once named Prophet Mohammed as its guest editor , published cartoons of the holy figure in the nude , and once renamed itself Sharia Hebdo with the cover slogan '100 lashes if you do n't die of laughter ' .\nThe controversy began in 2006 when the publication reprinted now-infamous cartoons of Prophet Mohammed by Danish artist Kurt Westergaard .\nWhen the images originally appeared they lead to days of protests across the Middle East and in Western cities .\nThe decision to reprint the images landed the then-editor in court under anti-terror laws , though he was later acquitted .\nThe Hebdo offices were burned to the ground in 2011 when attackers used Molotov cocktails to start a blaze early in the morning of November 2 .\nThere was nobody in the building at the time , and the target was instead thought to be the newspaper 's computer system , which was completely destroyed .\nRiot police were forced to stand guard outside the building for days following the attack , as the editors took a defiant stance , choosing to reprint the cartoon images multiple times .\nIn 2012 they again printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed as a deliberately provocative gesture while violent protests were taking place across the Middle East .\nThe following year the newspaper 's office again had to be surrounded by riot officers after they published a cartoon booklet depicting the Prohpet naked as a baby and being pushed in a wheelchair .\nOn the final page of the booklet there was a note from the editor , Stephane Charbonnier , saying the images were 'halal ' because Muslims had worked on them , and that they were factually accurate as they had been derived from descriptions in the Koran .\nThe satirical publication , widely seen as France 's answer to Private Eye , prides itself on a mixture of tongue-in-cheek reporting and investigative journalism .\nHebdo 's current office building has no notices on the door to prevent a repeat of the attacks that have occurred in the past .\nIn an interview with De Volkskrant in January 2013 , Mr Charbonnier revealed he had been placed under constant police protection for four months after one of the cartoon issues was published .\nHe shrugged off criticism that he was only publishing the images to gain notoriety for Hebdo , and insisted that he was instead defending the right to free speech .\nMr Charbonnier pointed out that the newspaper had poked fun at feminism , nuclear energy and homeland security , but the Islam issues always attracted the most publicity .\n\u2018 We need more and better intelligence-led activity at home and we need to defeat the IS state abroad .\n\u2018 It 's not surprising that so many people in Europe are demonstrating against what they see as the Islamisation of Europe .\n\u2018 However , their target should not be the vast majority of European Muslims who want nothing to do with Islamism , but the political movement it has produced .\n\u2018 This is n't about religion or faith communities , it 's about revolutionary politics and violence and only force can overcome it. \u2019 The offices of the same newspaper were burnt down in a petrol attack in 2011 after running a magazine cover of the Prophet Mohammed as a cartoon character .\nAt the time , the editor-in-chief , Stephane Charbonnier , said Islam could not be excluded from freedom of the press .\nHe said : 'If we can poke fun at everything in France , if we can talk about anything in France apart from Islam or the consequences of Islamism , that is annoying . '\nMr Charbonnier , also known as Charb , said he did not see the attack on the newspaper as the work of French Muslims , but of what he called 'idiot extremists ' .\nThe cover showed Mohammed saying : '100 lashes if you are not dying of laughter ' .\nThis week 's Charlie Hebdo also featured the author Houellebecq , whose new novel imagines Muslims taking over the French government in 2022 .\nInside , there was an editorial , attributed to the Prophet Muhammad , and more cartoons - one showing the Prophet with a clown 's red nose .\nDepiction of the Prophet is strictly prohibited in Islam , but the newspaper denied it was trying to be provocative .\nA firebomb attack gutted the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo in November 2011 after it put an image of the Prophet Mohammed on its cover ."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Reddit In Chaos After Allegedly Firing AMA Coordinator Victoria TaylorIf you tried to visit r/IAmA ( one of Reddit \u2019 s biggest subs ) recently , you were probably greeted by the image above .\nAnd if you \u2019 ve been absolutely anywhere else on the site at all in the past few hours , you probably noticed that everyone is flipping their collective shit over speculation that Victoria Taylor , the high-profile coordinator that kept IAmA afloat , was suddenly and mysteriously fired .\nAlso , something about Jesse Jackson .\nWhat \u2019 s actually going on ?\nIn addition to being one of the internet \u2019 s premier incubators for racism and bigotry of all sorts , Reddit is also perhaps best known for its AmAs ( otherwise known as \u201c Ask Me Anything \u201d ) \u2014in which people with varying degrees of celebrity will come and answer questions for the masses to see .\nCoordinating and verifying all those celebrities takes a massive amount of work , which is why Victoria Taylor , the site \u2019 s Director of Talent , seems to have been so immensely beloved by the site \u2019 s many , voluntary moderators\u2014she was good .\nApparently , where other Reddit \u201c admins \u201d ( read : actual , paid Reddit employees ) usually brush off moderators \u2019 questions and concerns , Taylor seemed to have a reputation for actually giving a shit .\nWhen asked why r/AmA had gone private , one of the subreddit \u2019 s mods , karmanaut , explained : And as AmA mod brownboy13 said in response to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian \u2019 s attempts to defuse the situation : To be honest , this is just wrong .\nI don \u2019 t think you were still involved with Reddit when we started getting very very popular and had a regular stream of celebrity AMAs incoming .\nWe didn \u2019 t have the ability or resources to walk them through it , or to schedule AMAs , or provide any other form of support .\n/r/IAmA limped along without her .\nWe managed to move from fire to fire and had some truly poor quality posts from people who didn \u2019 t understand Reddit or what the AMA format was all about .\nWoody Harrelson , of course , is the prime example .\nAnother would be the fake Emilia Clarke AMA that blew up and everyone thought was real until her manager personally contacted us to tell us that it was wrong .\nAnd it translates into bad press for Redditwhen that happens .\nThe subreddit is going to continue to grow by what , 7 or 8 thousand users per day ?\nBy saying that we \u2019 re returning to the pre-Victoria status quo , you \u2019 re admitting that you \u2019 re shooting us in the leg but still expecting us to run the same speed .\nWe can \u2019 t do that .\nAnd frankly , interactions with other Reddit admins have not been amazing .\nWe \u2019 re constantly ignored by the community team even when discussing serious issues that need some admin resolution .\nAnd as someone else already pointed out , one of the main times that we relied on the general admin team to set up and run an AMA , it was a clusterfuck : Morgan Freeman .\nBecause no one thought to get clear proof that it was really him .\nVictoria wouldn \u2019 t make that mistake .\nIts not just moderators for that specific subreddit , though .\nTaylor \u2019 s loss is apparently having ripple effects over major portions of the site .\nOne r/Science moderator ( another of the site \u2019 s biggest subreddits ) even threatened to shut that down over the unexplained loss : I fully support this decision to shut down /r/IAmA , letting Victoria go is a slap .\nTo back this up , I am the mod in /r/science that organizes all of the science AMAs , and I am going to have meaningful problems in the /r/Science AMAs , Victoria was the only line of communication with the admins .\nIf someone wants to get analytics for an AMA the answer will be \u201c Sorry , I can \u2019 t help. \u201d Dropping this on all of us in the AMA sphere feels like an enormous slap to those of us who put in massive amounts of time to bring quality content to reddit .\nI personally feel like shutting /r/science down as well , that \u2019 s how much of a bad taste this leaves .\nAnd this is just the latest in the recent string of Redditor revolts .\nGranted , most recently the issue was the Nazi-themed protests in response to the banning of five , small , particularly toxic subreddits\u2014but regardless , tensions are high .\nCompounding the issue is the fact that , other than Ellen Pao , Reddit \u2019 s almost universally user-despised interim CEO ( due to the fact that she does actually enforce the site \u2019 s new harassment policy ) , Taylor was one of the only visible women playing any sort of key role in the company .\nWhile Reddit declined to comment to Gawker on the circumstances surrounding her leaving , we do know that she certainly wasn \u2019 t expecting it .\nIn a thread requesting some sort of comment from her , Taylor responded saying that she was \u201c dazed. \u201d Why is Victoria Taylor out ?\nThere are two possibilities that seem likely at this point .\nThe first being the fact that Reddit had announced months ago that it would start requiring its employees to relocate to San Francisco .\nTaylor is currently living in New York .\nThe second ( and my favorite ) theory : So the current rumor is Jesse Jackson 's AMA led to Victoria being fired at Reddit , and this shitstorm starting up.Unconfirmed , of course .\nJuly 3 , 2015 Yes .\nYesterday , Jesse Jackson hosted an AMA that went absolutely to shit .\nJackson seemed to be providing arbitrary answers to questions that had never been asked , regardless of what he was responding to .\nWhen asked \u201c What are some things that the average African-American can do to help reduce racial tensions in his area ? \u201d Jackson wrote three , non-sensical paragraphs that started with \u201c Well , the source of those tensions often come from denial of an even playing field .\nYou know , we are very good at athletics. \u201d One particularly vicious post asked , \u201c My question is simple ; how is your relationship with the illegitimate child you fathered in 1998 while cheating on your wife ?\nBonus question : How much money have you extorted from various people and companies over the years of practicing your shakedown scheme ?\nDo you think Al Capone would be jealous of your business model if he were still alive ? \u201d To which Jackson offered : Which , though an absolute and utter mess , isn \u2019 t necessarily Taylor \u2019 s fault , so it doesn \u2019 t seem like a fireable offense in itself\u2014although the timing does raise an eyebrow .\nEither way , Taylor has yet to make any substantial statement on her apparent dismissal , but if you have any more information about what the hell is going on over at Reddit , you can send me an email here .\nUpdate 10:15pm : As of right now , the following default ( i.e .\nmajor ) subreddits have shut down , according to Reddit user Greypo , \u201c in protest of the admins \u2019 lack of communication with the moderators and ignoring their opinions , ideas , and requests .\nThe firing of Victoria was the catalyst. \u201d We \u2019 ll update this list periodically , but you can see a more complete list ( including non-default subreddits ) here .\nUpdate 12:10am : To the three subscribers of /r/sexwithbears , we are so sorry for your loss .\nUpdate 1:42am : An image of what is allegedly a now-deleted post on Quora from Marc Bodnick , the site \u2019 s Business and Community Leader , has been making its way around Reddit : I \u2019 ve reached out to Bodnick for confirmation , but it certainly seems like the most plausible explanation so far .\nOn a more somber note , we would like to also extend our condolences to the darkened members of /r/TreesSuckingOnThings .\nUpdate 9:02am : Ohanian seems to be rightfully panicking over the fact huge portions of his site have gone dark .\nFrom a weak sort of mea culpa he posted earlier this morning , which you can read in full here : That said , I would like to accomplish two things immediately : Get the blacked out subreddits back online Your message was received loud and clear .\nThe communication between Reddit and the moderators needs to improve dramatically .\nWe will work closely with you all going forward to ensure events like today don \u2019 t happen again .\nAt this point , however , the blackout has served its purpose , and now it \u2019 s time to get Reddit functioning again .\nI know many of you are still upset .\nWe will continue to work through these issues with you all , but redditors don \u2019 t deserve to be punished any further over an issue that is ultimately between Reddit and the moderators .\nWork out a plan for going forward In the short-term , we will use this forum to discuss how we will improve being a moderator on reddit .\nI \u2019 ll personally be in here asking and listening .\nThere are a couple of changes we can make immediately to improve our relationship : u/krispykrackers [ 5 ] , a well-trusted employee and community member , is now going to be point person for moderator issues .\nThis should help alleviate the immediate pain , and we \u2019 ll continue to evaluate how it \u2019 s working going forward .\n...

we have to win the security war against it and contain it , otherwise big trouble lies ahead .\nLocation : Officers were involved in a gunfight with the men , who escaped in a hijacked car and sped away from the office towards east Paris 'We have to be stand strong with the international community ' : A visibly shocked French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande arrives at the scene , where he promised to bring those responsible to justice '100 LASHES IF YOU DO N'T DIE OF LAUGHTER ' : HOW CHARLIE HEBDO HAS BECOME A BYWORD FOR ANTI-ISLAMISM Charlie Hebdo has become a byword for offensive statements in France after taking several highly provocative swipes at Islam .\nThe newspaper once named Prophet Mohammed as its guest editor , published cartoons of the holy figure in the nude , and once renamed itself Sharia Hebdo with the cover slogan '100 lashes if you do n't die of laughter ' .\nThe controversy began in 2006 when the publication reprinted now-infamous cartoons of Prophet Mohammed by Danish artist Kurt Westergaard .\nWhen the images originally appeared they lead to days of protests across the Middle East and in Western cities .\nThe decision to reprint the images landed the then-editor in court under anti-terror laws , though he was later acquitted .\nThe Hebdo offices were burned to the ground in 2011 when attackers used Molotov cocktails to start a blaze early in the morning of November 2 .\nThere was nobody in the building at the time , and the target was instead thought to be the newspaper 's computer system , which was completely destroyed .\nRiot police were forced to stand guard outside the building for days following the attack , as the editors took a defiant stance , choosing to reprint the cartoon images multiple times .\nIn 2012 they again printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed as a deliberately provocative gesture while violent protests were taking place across the Middle East .\nThe following year the newspaper 's office again had to be surrounded by riot officers after they published a cartoon booklet depicting the Prohpet naked as a baby and being pushed in a wheelchair .\nOn the final page of the booklet there was a note from the editor , Stephane Charbonnier , saying the images were 'halal ' because Muslims had worked on them , and that they were factually accurate as they had been derived from descriptions in the Koran .\nThe satirical publication , widely seen as France 's answer to Private Eye , prides itself on a mixture of tongue-in-cheek reporting and investigative journalism .\nHebdo 's current office building has no notices on the door to prevent a repeat of the attacks that have occurred in the past .\nIn an interview with De Volkskrant in January 2013 , Mr Charbonnier revealed he had been placed under constant police protection for four months after one of the cartoon issues was published .\nHe shrugged off criticism that he was only publishing the images to gain notoriety for Hebdo , and insisted that he was instead defending the right to free speech .\nMr Charbonnier pointed out that the newspaper had poked fun at feminism , nuclear energy and homeland security , but the Islam issues always attracted the most publicity .\n\u2018 We need more and better intelligence-led activity at home and we need to defeat the IS state abroad .\n\u2018 It 's not surprising that so many people in Europe are demonstrating against what they see as the Islamisation of Europe .\n\u2018 However , their target should not be the vast majority of European Muslims who want nothing to do with Islamism , but the political movement it has produced .\n\u2018 This is n't about religion or faith communities , it 's about revolutionary politics and violence and only force can overcome it. \u2019 The offices of the same newspaper were burnt down in a petrol attack in 2011 after running a magazine cover of the Prophet Mohammed as a cartoon character .\nAt the time , the editor-in-chief , Stephane Charbonnier , said Islam could not be excluded from freedom of the press .\nHe said : 'If we can poke fun at everything in France , if we can talk about anything in France apart from Islam or the consequences of Islamism , that is annoying .

''\nStraight-up dread , straight-up emotional emptiness .\nWhen Linus \u2014 who is , in many ways , the nice one \u2014 tells him , `` Of all the Charlie Browns in the world , you 're the Charlie Browniest , '' it feels like the kind of improvisational brutality in which kids really do specialize .\nAnd that 's not his only problem .\nCharlie Brown says things like , `` I know nobody likes me .\nWhy do we have to have a holiday season to emphasize it ? ''\nI know nobody likes me .\nThat 's unvarnished , and while the special will end with everyone telling him `` Merry Christmas , '' you will not really see much evidence in the next 20-plus minutes that they do , in fact , like him .\nHe 's sad , for real , and he lives in that feeling , and he uses the word `` depressed '' to describe it .\nAs with most things in Charlie Brown 's life , it is a load that will be temporarily lifted , but never resolved .\nHe 's so desperate for help , in fact , that he continues to pay Lucy five cents to think poorly of him in more sophisticated language .\nHer solution to his need for `` involvement '' is to make him the director of the Christmas play , a doomed scenario from the start , no ?\nBut of course , it 's also unlikely that a special would end with a character reading Scripture with the earnestness of Linus .\n( It might be unlikely for a character to exist with the earnestness of Linus in the first place . )\nBut as common as it is for viewers to remark on the religious content of the special , that content does n't exist in a vacuum .\nIt does n't exist to say , `` It 's a religious holiday , and therefore you should spurn its secular aspects . ''\nQuite the contrary : Linus ' reading inspires Charlie Brown to redouble his efforts to decorate his sad little tree .\nAnd it inspires his friends to follow him and , when he becomes overwhelmed with sadness about said sad little tree , to help him .\nSo as much as A Charlie Brown Christmas is about the significance of the religious tradition as what Christmas is `` really about , '' it sees that tradition at least in part as a gateway to , and an inspiration for , other actions .\nIt does n't only suggest Christmas is really about the Bible story ; it suggests Christmas is also really about friends , dogs , cooperating , the beauty of humble things , singing out loud , and hope .\nIt 's just not about writing your Christmas list and asking for , as Sally does , `` 10s and 20s . ''\nThe only thing you really ca n't recapture from 1965 is scarcity .\nIt was once the case that Christmas specials could be seen only at Christmas .\nNow , you and your family can watch Charlie Brown anytime you want , anywhere you want .\nIt 's convenience at the expense of a certain kind of preciousness , to be sure .\nBut if you still want to be the kind of person who watches things when they happen to be on , Monday night is the night for that sad little tree ."}
