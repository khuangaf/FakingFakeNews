{"txt": "By Bryony Jones for CNN Protesters have taken control of several key cities across Libya , but government forces appear to be fighting back . \nU.N. has imposed sanctions against Gadhafi , freezing assets and blocking travel Some experts are calling for a no-fly zone , but further U.N. resolution would be needed Libya 's ambassador to U.S. says his people are being ` slaughtered like sheep ' , pleads for action -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than two weeks after protests against Moammar Gadhafi 's regime began , the Libyan leader is still clinging to power , insisting `` we will fight until the last man and woman to defend Libya . '' \nContinuing unrest and violence has left experts warning of a major humanitarian disaster , as thousands of people flee across the borders into neighboring Tunisia and Egypt . \nSo what can the international community do to stop further bloodshed ? \nAnd will anything they do convince Gadhafi to step down after more than 40 years in power ? \nWhat about a no-fly zone to keep Libyan military aircraft out of the skies ? \nSome witnesses have accused pro-Gadhafi forces of firing on civilians from the air , but U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Tuesday that these reports could not be confirmed . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the imposition of a no-fly zone was under consideration . \nBut Mullen said doing so would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' \nAli Suleiman Aujali , the Libyan ambassador to the U.S. who broke with the Libyan government over the use of force against protesters , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer that his people were being `` slaughtered like sheep '' and the international community needed to step in -- or else stop encouraging the uprising . \nShould US arm Libyan rebels ? \nJohn McCain pushes Libya no-fly zone `` They have to dominate the skies , they have to stop the march of the tanks towards Misrata and towards Tripoli , '' he said . \n`` They have to take measures to stop these massacres going on in my country . \nIf you ca n't act now , then do n't encourage us to die . '' \nJohn Bellinger , a former legal adviser to the U.S. State Department , told CNN , `` Legally , there is no authority for the United States or any other country to do that under international law unless authorized by the Security Council . \n`` Politically it could be quite problematic ... for the United States or NATO to begin shooting down Libyan aircraft , even in the face of the things that Gadhafi is doing against his own nationals . '' \nWhat role does the United Nations play ? \nThe United Nations Security Council has already taken some action against the Gadhafi regime , but it has not authorized the use of armed force . \nIts members met at the weekend and voted unanimously for sanctions , including an arms embargo , assets freeze , and a travel ban for Gadhafi , his family , and key associates . \nHowever , they did not support calls for a no-fly-zone , and any decision on whether to impose one is likely to have to wait for a further U.N. resolution . \nIf the U.N. did vote in favor of a no-fly-zone , NATO would likely play some role in enforcing it , but NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen insists no action could be taken without a U.N. mandate . \n`` A no-fly-zone is not a part of the U.N. Security Council resolution , and a far-reaching approach like that would require a U.N. Security Council mandate , '' he told CNN . \n`` It 's a hypothetical question at this stage , but if the issue is raised , and if there is a request -LRB- for cooperation -RRB- then the NATO council will consider it , but that 's not the case for the time being . \n`` We have started preparations for all eventualities , but I think it is a bit premature to outline any timeline . '' \nIs Italy 's decision to suspend its non-aggression pact significant ? \nIf any military action , such as enforcing a no-fly-zone , were to be taken , troops would likely have to use air bases in Italy . \nItaly is also home to the U.S. Navy 's Sixth Fleet . \nUnder a friendship treaty , signed three years ago by Gadhafi and Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi , Italy agreed to pay Libya compensation for its colonial rule of the country , and Libya pledged to help stem the tide of refugees heading for Italy from its shores . \nBut the pact also included a non-aggression clause , under which Italy promised not to allow its territories to be used to launch military operations against Libya . \nThe treaty was suspended over the weekend . \nWhat happens to Libya after Gadhafi ? \nExplain it to me : Libya unrest Possible military aid to Libya Explain it to me : Libya unrest Kurt Volker , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , told CNN that Italy 's suspension of the pact would not immediately enable military operations to be launched from that country . \n`` If you 're really trying to think about military action , do you have some kind of authorization to do so ? \nYou would need a U.N. mandate and possibly a NATO declaration or both , and there is n't anything like that on the table at the moment , '' he said . \nAldo Amati , deputy press secretary for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , insisted the treaty had not been suspended to pave the way for military action . \n`` There 's no connection , '' he told CNN . \n`` There 's no link between the two things . '' \nWhat about sanctions against the Gadhafi regime ? \nGadhafi is no stranger to sanctions : He was subject to them for many years following Libya 's refusal to hand over suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 , in which 270 people were killed . \nThis time around though , the international community has taken further action , freezing the Libyan leader 's assets and those of his family and the regime . \nThe U.S. alone has blocked access to at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets , the largest amount ever blocked under a sanctions program . \nTravel bans too are likely to impact the Gadhafi family 's jet-setting lifestyle . \nWhat will the U.S. do ? \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton insists that : `` Nothing is off the table , so long as the Libyan government continues to threaten and kill Libyan citizens . '' \nHowever , analysts say it seems unlikely that that the U.S. would launch attacks on Libya without a U.N. mandate . \nRosemary Hollis , Professor of Middle East Policy Studies at City University London , said : `` The messy fact of Afghanistan and Iraq has been to deter any kind of gung-ho notion that you can sort our any very foreign country by force . '' \nBut some prominent figures have called for other forms of military action to be taken - and quickly . \nSenator John McCain -LRB- R-Arizona -RRB- is one of those urging the introduction of a no-fly-zone : `` Libyan pilots are n't going to fly if there 's a no-fly-zone . '' \nAnd Senator Joe Lieberman -LRB- I-Connecticut -RRB- has gone one further , arguing that as well as offering aid to the rebels , the U.S. should be supplying them with weapons . \nThomas Donnelly , of the American Enterprise Institute , says the mere sight of U.S. fighter jets over Libya would send a powerful message to Gadhafi . \n`` Even if we just buzzed the palace and did n't release any ordnance , the symbolic action or the psychological effect could be enough to bring the war to a quick conclusion , '' he said . \nThe U.S. military is already close by : At least one destroyer is in the Mediterranean , and the amphibious assault ship the USS Kearsarge is in the Red Sea , close to the Suez Canal . \nThe Kearsarge is well equipped to deal with casualties : it houses a floating hospital -- including six operating theaters -- which can care for up to 600 patients . \nThe aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and its strike group are also in the region , able to move closer , if needed . \nHowever , Hollis said without a U.N. resolution , action remains unlikely . \n`` The only way I think they would launch military action without a clear U.N. mandate is by covertly supporting the opposition on the ground , '' she said .

{"txt": "Colin Smith offers a magisterial account of the British retreat along the Malay peninsula in Singapore Burning , says Neal Ascherson The Australians at Singapore broke and ran . \nAnyone old enough to remember hearing that story must have wondered if it was n't just another of those sour wartime myths , brewed in British hearts to compensate for losing an empire and getting bread rationing . \nThis tremendous book shows that it was . \nGeneral Gordon Bennett 's infantry gave way and fled by the thousand as the Japanese stormed ashore . \nBut seen across 60 years and by the standards of today , running away made sense . \nWar is a mad island , on which reasonable behavior is reversed . \nSoldiers are required to act as if they do n't care . \nThey are required to disconnect instinct and stay in position as a mortar barrage approaches . \nThey must try to kill other people who , if left unchallenged , might not try to kill them back . \nThree states of mind can help soldiers achieve this reversal . \nOne is blind obedience , becoming an institutionalised patient in the madhouse . \nThe second is believing that the safety of the family or community you love is genuinely at stake . \nThe third is to have an at least credible expectation of winning this war . \nThe Australians at Singapore had none of these . \nAs free men , they found it hard to risk their necks on the orders of officers they considered dangerous idiots . \nAs citizens , they would have been happy to biff Jerries in defense of poor old England , but what were they doing defending the privileges of stuck-up Poms in this Asian colony ? \nAs soon as they got into action on the Malay peninsula , it became obvious the Japanese were going to win . \nChurchill sent telegrams about fighting to the bitter end and dying in the ruins of Singapore to save the honor of the race . \nThousands of Australians , who were to fight fiercely and expertly in later campaigns , did n't see the point of that and headed for the docks . \nReading Smith 's account , you see their logic . \nHow could the British and Australians have hoped to win with the resources they had ? \nThe Japanese assault force was numerically smaller than the defense , but mostly composed of highly trained and battle-hardened troops . \nMalaya was defended by a strange assortment of British regulars , inexperienced Australians and Indian army divisions whose men were often half-trained teenagers . \nThe Japanese brought tanks and a large tactical airforce . \nThe British had no tanks and , worse , very few anti-tank weapons . \nTheir airforce , mainly composed of slow and obsolete machines without modern fighters until the last few days , lost half its strength in the first 24 hours after the Japanese landed in northern Malaya on 8 December 1941 . \nWhen bombs and torpedoes sank the battlecruiser Repulse and the battleship Prince of Wales two days later , Japan achieved naval as well as air supremacy . \nIt 's true that the defenders were plagued by terrible mistakes and bad luck . \nThese nourish fantasies that the outcome could have been different . \nIf the British had entered southern Thailand , instead of dithering until it was too late , could n't they have slaughtered the invaders on the beaches ? \nIf Admiral Phillips had set off earlier to attack the invasion fleet , or turned back as soon as he knew his warships had been spotted , could n't the Japanese troopships have been scattered ? \nIf the ship with more anti-tank guns had n't been sunk ; if the RAF had possessed Hurricanes at the start instead of the old Brewster Buffalos ; if the Australian artillery had received the signals that the Japanese assault landing on Singapore island had begun ... But none of these possibilities was the case . \nEven if they had been , Smith 's book suggests that the attack would have still prevailed . \nThe defenders , often heroically brave , were simply not up to it . \nSymptomatic is their shocking failure to communicate . \nThe radios did not work , the field-telephone cables broke , the signals routines were chaotic . \nWhen the first landings began at Kota Baharu , all communications with Singapore jammed so that it was 90 minutes before local aircraft were ordered to bomb the beaches . \nIt was also true that the Japanese were better soldiers . \nSmith points out that they were neither suicidal fanatics nor trained jungle fighters . \nTheir personal weapons were slightly inferior . \n` What -LRB- they -RRB- had in abundance was courage , endurance and a discipline that , in their eagerness to see that orders were carried out , did not stifle initiative but encouraged it . ' \nMost of this book is an account , from hundreds of sources on both sides , of the long British retreat down the Malay peninsula , punctuated by desperate battles . \nColin Smith knows how it feels to be a soldier , and his story - the experiences of named men and units as they fought , retreated with terrible wounds or died - is unforgettably well told . \nSo is his history of the aftermath : the fall of the great city , the bayoneting of the hospital wounded , the murder of the Australian nurses , the massacre of the Chinese population . \nThe British commander , General Percival , lost 7,500 dead in the 10-week campaign . \nThen he went with his men into captivity , where more than 12,000 died . \nGeneral Gordon Bennett bolted and got a boat to Sumatra . \nHistory should be rougher with him than with his soldiers . \nThey asked themselves what they were dying for and found no convincing answer . \nThe defense of Malaya and Singapore was a war which could not be won , but which had to be fought . \nBecause nobody knew an alternative . \nWrite your review of this or any other book , find out what other readers thought or add it to your lists Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@observer.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : 00.50 BST on Sunday 12 June 2005 Find books to review , discuss , buy Search all -LRB- title , author or ISBN -RRB- Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting .

{"txt": "BP PLC CEO Tony Hayward talks to reporters as he visits a Coast Guard command center in Venice , La. , Sunday , May 30 , 2010 . \nThe 40-foot-long corrugated steel boxes , resembling oversized white shipping containers , are stacked . \n`` There are no permanent residents on the port , '' Dennis Link , a manager from a BP refinery , says . -- PORT FOURCHON , La. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- The 40-foot-long corrugated steel boxes , resembling oversized white shipping containers , are stacked two high and three wide atop a barge at Port Fourchon , the oil industry 's hub on the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe words `` Martin Quarters '' painted in black offer the only clue that they 're not stuffed with cargo . \nThis barge is a floating hotel , or `` flotel , '' set up by BP and several subcontractors to accommodate more than 500 workers hired to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nTemporary housing is the only way to station workers at Port Fourchon , a massive shipyard that serves offshore oil rigs and is surrounded by ecologically sensitive marshes and beaches . \n`` There are no permanent residents here on the port , '' said Dennis Link , a manager from a BP refinery who 's handling logistics at the 1,300-acre site that 's easily accessible by ship , but reachable on land only by a state road that snakes through the bayous . \nWith the ambitious `` top kill '' having failed over the weekend and a relief well at least two months away , BP was ramping up its efforts to clean up the Louisiana coast . \nAnother temporary fix -- an effort to saw through the pipe leaking the oil and cap it -- could be tried as soon as Wednesday . \nIn the meantime , more than 125 miles of the state 's coastline already have been hit with oil , including the resort of Grand Isle near Port Fourchon . \nThe cleanup , relief wells and temporary fixes were being watched closely by President Barack Obama 's administration . \nObama planned to meet for the first time Tuesday with the co-chairmen of an independent commission investigating the spill , while Attorney General Eric Holder was headed to the Gulf Coast to meet with state attorneys general . \nOn Monday afternoon , the living quarters on the flotel sat empty . \nGenerators pumped in cool air and powered the lights , and at the foot of each bunk sat a towel , washcloth and individually wrapped bar of soap . \nIf necessary , four tents on dry land nearby can house 500 more workers . \nWorkers will likely be trucked in on the two-lane state road . \nThe accommodations on the barge are Spartan , but comfortable -- similar to military barracks . \nEach pod contains 12 bunks , with a bathroom for every four . \nPer Coast Guard standards , each resident gets 30 square feet of space in the quarters . \nThe barge has 10 washers , 10 dryers and a kitchen , although food will be served in a tent on land . \nThe quarters are typically floated alongside offshore oil rigs to supplement housing on the drilling operations . \nThe flotel could be moved if significant amounts of oil wash up at another location . \nAnother flotel sits about 15 miles away , off Grand Isle , and BP plans to establish them elsewhere along the coast . \nPort Fourchon and Grand Isle were quiet Monday , with only a handful of people seen walking on the beaches by an Associated Press reporter and photographer flying over in a helicopter . \nBP is hiring local workers and ones from other states , and Link acknowledged that some from Louisiana might prefer a long drive home each to staying on the flotel . \nFor Chad Martin , co-owner of Martin Quarters , business is booming . \nHis company has 200 living quarters , and 60 were available when a BP subcontractor called . \nThe oil giant rented every single one . \nBut Martin understands the gravity of the situation . \n`` This is not the way to get work , '' he said Cleanup efforts are being ramped up while BP also tries the latest in a series of patchwork fixes , this one a cut-and-cap process to put a lid on the leaking wellhead so oil can be siphoned to the surface . \nThe risky procedure could , at least temporarily , increase the oil flowing from the busted well . \nUsing robot submarines , BP plans to cut away the riser pipe this week and place a cap-like containment valve over the blowout preventer . \nOn Monday , live video feeds showed robot submarines moving equipment around and using a circular saw-like device to cut small pipes at the bottom of the Gulf . \nBP failed to plug the leak Saturday with its top kill , which shot mud and pieces of rubber into the well but could n't beat back the pressure of the oil . \nThe oil company also announced plans Monday to try attaching another pipe to a separate opening on the blowout preventer with some of the same equipment used to pump in mud during the top kill . \nThe company also wants to build a new freestanding riser to carry oil toward the surface , which would give it more flexibility to disconnect and then reconnect containment pipes if a hurricane passed through . \nNeither of those plans would start before mid-June and would supplement the cut-and-cap effort . \nBut the best chances for sealing off the leak are two relief wells , the first of which wo n't be ready until August . \nThe spill has already leaked between 19.7 million and 43 million gallons , according to government estimates . \nFor the relief well to succeed , the bore hole must precisely intersect the damaged well , which experts have compared to hitting a target the size of a dinner plate more than two miles into the earth . \nIf it misses , BP will have to back up its drill , plug the hole it just created , and try again . \n`` The probability of them hitting it on the very first shot is virtually nil , '' said David Rensink , incoming president of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists , who spent most of his 39 years in the oil industry in offshore exploration . \n`` If they get it on the first three or four shots they 'd be very lucky . '' \nThe trial-and-error process could take weeks , but it will eventually work , scientists and BP said . \nThen engineers will then pump mud and cement through pipes to ultimately seal the well . \nOn the slim chance the relief well does n't work , scientists were n't sure exactly how much -- or how long -- the oil would flow . \nThe gusher would continue until the well bore hole collapsed or pressure in the reservoir dropped to a point where oil was no longer pushed to the surface , said Tad Patzek , chair of the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the University of Texas-Austin . \nBP said it does n't know how much oil is in the reservoir because it was starting to collect and analyze data on its size when the rig exploded April 20 . \nIn Patzek 's mind , failing to get the relief wells to work is n't an option . \n`` I do n't admit the possibility of it not working , '' he said .

{"txt": "2 men charged in death of Chicago teen who performed in inauguration event . \nIt was a stark , raw tweet from Ben Wedeman with a big impact on our newsroom Saturday morning . \nOne of our first and most-trusted sources of information on the conflict in Libya had become a victim of the very civil war he in some ways had helped to spark . \nIn the first few days of the conflict back in February , `` Mo '' as we called him had become an inspiration , friend and `` go-to '' source as well as a regular witness on CNN 's shows . \nOf course , you would n't know that from watching . \nWe blurred his face and gave him code-names like `` Benghazi Protester '' in order to protect him and his young family . \nIt was a struggle to keep him from blurting out his name and even phone number on air , sometimes , as Mohammed said that he wanted freedom for Libya , or to be martyred trying to achieve it . \n`` I am not afraid to die , I am afraid to lose the battle , '' the young , western-educated software engineer would tell us when we asked him to keep his identity secret . \nLibya before the fighting started was one of those very few `` black holes '' on the world 's map for us : like North Korea or Syria , it was a country where the regimes iron grip on information was so strong and the secret police so brutal and pervasive that the risk of contacting people was simply not justified for putting peoples lives at risk by staying in regular communication . \nWhen that all began to crumble beginning on February 17th and Libyans in the country 's east began to rise up , we had to develop webs of witnesses from scrap . \nBut one quickly became our most savvy source : a 27-year-old technology expert and former internet provider in Benghazi . \nMohammed and other supporters had set up a kind of protest command center in the city 's courthouse after ejecting Ghadhafi 's forces in the first days of fighting . \nThat 's where we first contacted him on February 18th - a guy who looked more Silicon Valley in a hooded sweatshirt and big headphones than a partisan in a Libyan war zone . \nAmazingly , Mohammed had beaten the regimes firewalls and jerry-rigged a live signal from the building . \nThe camera showed the few hundred protesters huddled outside against the walls due to the cold and whipping winds - worried that Gadhafi 's forces could swoop in at any moment . \nIt was our first view of the protests there , and we were worried that all this would be traced back and used to target the band of students and young people defying the Gadhafi regime . \nAt first Mo just wanted to get that picture to us , as he felt that it provided a thin blanket of security . \nHe thought Ghadhafi might hold back if he knew that ordering the army or his feared African mercenaries to slaughter the protesters would be seen on live television around the globe . \nMohammed pushed the technical know-how limits of our engineers and desk editors such as Yousuf Basil , Jack Maddox , Ben Brumfield and myself as he came up with elaborate ways to get more and more cameras going around the courthouse . \nBut it was n't until we started interviewing him on air that we realized how special he was . \nMohammed poignantly told us about how the army had shot into the crowds , then using armored vehicles to roll over protesters after they had run out of ammunition , and how the demonstrators would not give up . \nAfter the first two days he told us with his live stream and webcasts he had become some sort of leader . \n`` People have been calling my mobile non-stop . \nI woke up today with 125 missed calls . \nPeople have been calling and checking on me to see if I am safe . \nOne person called from Serbia just to say they are thinking of me and my struggle .

{"txt": "Vials containing samples of the swine flu virus are making their way from the US to a government laboratory north of London . \nThe race for a vaccine is on . \nManufacturers are currently working on the seasonal flu vaccine It is a global endeavor and will bring the public and the private together , but it could still take several months before a safe and effective jab is available . \nYet amid all this activity , the answer could in fact be right under our noses . \nTests are being carried out to establish whether the current seasonal flu vaccine could provide cross protection against what we are seeing at the moment , as there are similarities between the H1N1 human flu viruses and the new H1N1 swine flu . \nIf that were the case - and it 's certainly not impossible - we would in the words of one virologist be `` home and dry '' . \nEven if this does not confer protection , the picture does not appear to be a bleak one . \nThe spread of bird flu amongst humans several years ago sparked fears that a pandemic was imminent . \nPlans were developed , expertise harnessed and facilities built for mass production . \nIf this had happened six years ago we would really be in a fix - we are in a better position than we have ever been in the history of this planet to combat this Barts and the London School of Medicine The vaccine industry has started to attract new investment and government subsidies after years of being a pharmaceutical backwater . \n`` It was a fantastic dry run , '' says Professor John Oxford of Barts and the London School of Medicine . \n`` If this had happened six years ago we would really be in a fix - we are in a better position than we have ever been in the history of this planet to combat this . '' \nThe World Health Organisation says it is already in touch with vaccine manufacturers - although is not at this stage putting in orders - but initial work is already underway in national laboratories . \nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which is looking at the molecular properties of the virus and why it appears to have been more virulent in Mexico is hoping to have produced a `` reference strain '' to send to vaccine manufacturers around the second week of May . \nThe same process will take place in the UK , once the Health Protection Agency -LRB- HPA -RRB- receives samples of the virus at its laboratories in Potters Bar . \n`` We will take this virus apart and reassemble it with two genes from the swine virus and the genetic information code for a laboratory virus called PR8 which grows very well in hens ' eggs and is safe for human infection , '' said Dr John Wood , from the HPA 's National Institute of Biological Standards and Control . \n`` When we have recreated this new hybrid virus this will be grown in cells and hens ' eggs ready to distribute to vaccine manufacturers . '' \nThis , he said , should be done within three to four weeks . \nBut it may be at least four to five months before a vaccine is ready . \nClearly , if you make a swine flu vaccine and the pandemic does n't actually occur , we could end up with no seasonal flu vaccine Safety is - unsurprisingly - paramount , as vaccines can often be worse than the disease they are trying to combat . \nAn outbreak of swine flu in 1976 infected 200 people in the US . \nOnly one of them died , but a vaccine administered to 40m people killed 25 and led to 500 others developing Guillain-Barre syndrome , which can be fatal . \nFor those countries now entering the summer months with the flu season behind them , a delay in vaccine is not a real cause for concern . \nBut in the southern hemisphere where countries are entering their winter months the picture would be different if the outbreak were to worsen . \nOne way of administering the vaccine could be by adding a swine flu component to the seasonal flu jab given out in the autumn . \nBut while production facilities are much more extensive than they once were , it could still take several years to produce enough swine vaccine to match global demand if the virus continues to spread and becomes more virulent . \nAnd in the rush to combat swine flu - from which there have been fewer than 10 confirmed deaths - manufacturers still have to keep their eye on producing an effective vaccine for seasonal flu as they do every year . \nIn the US alone there are an estimated 25-50 million cases reported each year . \nThese result in 150,000 hospitalisations and 30,000 to 40,000 deaths . \nWorldwide there may be as many as half a million deaths each year . \n`` Clearly , if you make a swine flu vaccine and the pandemic does n't actually occur , we could end up with no seasonal flu vaccine , '' warned Chris Viehbacher , chief executive officer of Sanofi-Aventis . \nIn any event , swine flu appears to be responding well to anti-viral treatments like Tamiflu and Relenza . \nThese drugs do not attack the virus itself but an enzyme that allows it to spread within the body . \nTaken promptly , they can reduce the severity and length of the illness . \nBut production of sufficient quantities - were they needed - could again be problematic , although pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Roche Holding AG have both said they are stepping up production .

{"txt": "Johnson Beharry was last week awarded the Victoria Cross for his acts of bravery during the Iraq war . \nPeter Beaumont and Jason Burke ask what factors - physical , psychological and moral - create a heroic act The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Sunday March 27 , 2005 In the article below we said Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay were awarded the VC for their role in the attack on Goose Green . \nIn fact , Sergeant McKay 's VC was awarded for his bravery during an attack on an enemy position on Mount Longdon , an objective in the battle for Port Stanley . \n` Heroism ' , wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson , ` is an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual 's character . ' \nIt is a mystery , war 's great enigma - what is it that makes one man run , another stand his ground , and an exceptional few display unusual courage . \nIt is a question that can only be answered by the fact that Johnson Beharry was last week awarded the Victoria Cross for his acts of bravery during the Iraq war . Herbert ` H ' Jones implied , `` he is a man of valor '' . \nHe is only the 1,354 th recipient since the medal was instituted in 1854 - and only the 11th since the end of the Second World War . \nAnd what underlies that question of heroism is not simply the details of his extraordinary valor as they were detailed last week , but by the pictures of Beharry himself . \nThey showed an open , easy and smiling face - comfortable , perhaps even a little shy - reinforcing his humanity . \nThey were pictures that insisted that we ask : what was it that made this ordinary man do such extraordinary things ? \nIt is a question , in truth , as old as writing and humanity itself - and one that only now scientists are beginning to understand . \nHomer took it as his theme in the Iliad , his depiction of the characters of two great and flawed warriors - Achilles and Hector - while Plato and Aristotle dissected what it meant for the citizen soldier . \nThe Old Testament authors presented their own archetypes for heroism , none more powerfully described than David 's struggle against Goliath . \nIn the last century , however , biologists and social scientists , physiologists and psychologists began to attempt to define Emerson 's ` secret impulse ' and the core nature of heroism itself . \nIt is a question that has been muddied by the fact that the idea of heroism at any time is defined by broader social values and shifting cultural perceptions . \nThe traditional meaning that accrued to it in the field of military endeavor was , perhaps , best expressed by Churchill 's physician , Lord Moran , who took two views of courage in his book , The Anatomy of Courage - as a ` true virtue ' , and as a special case of self-control . \nHe rejected , too , the idea of courage as a constant . \nInstead he took the view that it was inevitably exhaustible . \nMost of all , believed Moran , it had to involve a conscious decision . \n` Courage is a moral quality , ' wrote Lord Moran . \n` It is not a chance gift of nature like an aptitude for games . \nIt is a cold choice between two alternatives , the fixed resolve not to quit ; an act of renunciation which must be made not once but many times by the power of the will . ' \nIt is a definition that could have been written for Johnson Beharry . \nThe story of Beharry 's heroism , however , is doubly meaningful because his story transcends the traditional idea of martial valor - that its function is violence alone - and incorporates more modern civil notions that real heroes are just those ordinary people who put themselves at risk to help others . \nThe 24-year-old armored vehicle driver was at the head of a five-vehicle convoy that came under attack on the outskirts of the central Iraqi city of Amara on the night of 1 May last year . \nThe vehicle Beharry was driving was hit by a barrage of rocket-propelled grenades , leaving the platoon commanding officer unconscious and presumed dead , and engulfing the vehicle in flames . \nBeharry , determined to get the casualties to safety and create a path for the other vehicles to follow , rammed a barricade and drove on through thick smoke and a mile-long ambush with his protective hatch blasted open . \nHe eventually delivered the troops to a secure area , twice returning to the vehicle under fire to carry the wounded inside a compound . \nWeeks later , his Warrior was ambushed again and a rocket exploded six inches away from him , causing serious head injuries . \nHe managed to reverse the Warrior and its occupants out of danger before collapsing into a coma . \nThey were actions that meant Beharry would become the first living recipient of a Victoria Cross -LRB- VC -RRB- since 1965 , and the first to get the medal since the 1982 Falklands conflict when Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay were awarded the VC posthumously for their role in the attack on Goose Green . \nIndeed , military experts believe that the award of the VC to Beharry signalled a recognition of the change in the army 's role . \n` For a long time the feeling was that the Victoria Cross should be reserved for gallantry in conventional war rather than the `` low-intensity conflicts '' that the British Army has primarily been involved in recently , ' said Andrew Dorman , a lecturer in Defense Studies at King 's College London . \nDorman said last week 's VC showed a recognition both that ` extreme gallantry is the same whatever ' , a belief recognized by Beharry 's fellow soldiers , who launched the campaign for him to be given the Victoria Cross after senior officers recommended him for honors . \nBut was there something in Beharry 's background that conditioned him for courage ? \nThe son of a Grenadan brickmaker who came to the United Kingdom in 1999 , Johnson grew up in a wooden hut without running water that he shared with his parents and seven brothers and sisters . \nIn interviews last week , his parents said that Johnson , who had enjoyed playing childhood war-games with his friends , had always dreamed of joining the British Army , leaving school at 14 . \nBeharry 's modest upbringing is one that he shares with other soldiers who have displayed the highest gallantry in war , including Audie Murphy , America 's most decorated soldier of World War Two , whose parents were dirt-poor sharecroppers , and Albert Jacka VC , the Australian hero of Gallipoli , a forestry labourer who rose rapidly through the ranks . \nYet none of this explains why some people are predisposed to be courageous , and in a way the majority are not . \nThis question has obsessed military commanders from the first decade of the last century onwards as they enlisted the new social sciences to try to find ways of persuading soldiers to be more aggressive - courageous in the traditional military sense . \nIt is the search for the roots of courage that was chronicled by Joanna Bourke of Birkbeck College in her book An Intimate History of Killing . \n` There was a problem : the instinct of self-preservation was as liable to lead to `` flight '' as to `` fight '' , ' wrote Bourke about the early attempts to understand valor . \n` To overcome this , military psychologists coupled instinct theory with the crowd psychology of men like Gustave Le Bon and his English populariser , Wilfred Trotter . \n` Humans were herd animals , with strong gregarious impulses . \nIn a crowd - and the army was only a trained crowd - the `` group mind '' would take over , endowing the individual with a sense of almost limitless power and immortality . ' \nThat was the theory for a while at least . \nBut it still did not explain why some soldiers were prepared to take more risks than others . \nBy the Fifties , research was hinting at other explanations . \nThe British psychologist , Hans Eysenck , developed a scale to measure the personality trait of extroversion , now regarded by psychologists as one of the most consistent predictors of risk-taking . \nOther physical studies , meanwhile , were beginning to reveal that the brain not only craved arousal , but somehow could regulate that arousal at an optimal level . \nOver the next three decades , researchers extended these early findings into a host of theories about risk-taking . \nIt led scientists , including Frank Farley in the US , to identify risk-takers as a whole new ` personality type ' - Type-A - which he subdivided into T-negative and T-positive , to distinguish between productive and destructive risk-taking : between the heroic tendency and the nihilistic . \nBiologists too were making critical breakthroughs in explaining those predisposed to risk-taking behavior , discovering the action of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase -LRB- MAO -RRB- in regulating arousal in the brain , with scientists discovering low levels of the enzyme in the brains of those dubbed High Sensation Seekers . \nAll of which suggests that military courage , of the kind understood by Moran , is a deeply complex coincidence of the physical , social and the moral ; of nature and nurture ; of instinct and that which is learned . \nBut for all the mystery of what courage is and where it comes from , one thing about it is immutable : it is the use of valor to reinforce what a society feels about its values , from Homer 's celebration of the valor of Greek and Trojan warriors , to Australia 's lionisation of Albert Jacka and the mythologising in the public mind of Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones . \nThe soldier 's story is being seen as a magnificent public relations opportunity for the army , which has been hit by scandals involving the abuse and death of recruits at Deepcut Barracks and the mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq . \nThough the army is only 500 men below its ideal strength of 104,000 , an initial surge in recruitment that followed the war in Iraq has now fallen away and , as is usual after a war , experienced soldiers are leaving . \n` Beharry was incredibly brave , incredibly competent and incredibly committed . \nHis story is a great advertisement for today 's army and everyone 's very pleased about that , ' one retired senior officer told The Observer . \nAnd Beharry 's heroism can help in other ways . \nThe forces have made repeated efforts to reach out to minorities . \nLast week the head of Britain 's armed forces made a direct appeal to the country 's Islamic community to encourage more Muslims to join up . \nGeneral Sir Michael Walker , the chief of defense staff , said he was personally committed to ` creating armed forces which reflect more fully the society we serve ' . \nBeharry , his great smiling face appearing on the front of newspapers , can mean far more to the creation of an image of the army as a diverse organization than any set of new statistics or new policies . \nFor the soldiers themselves it is a different state of affairs . \nFor them heroism is best summed up by the speech of Clearchos to his soldiers in Xenophon 's Anabasis . ' \nI will go with you and suffer whatever I must suffer . \nFor I consider that you are my country and my friends and comrades ; and with you , I think I shall be honored wherever I may be , but without you I think I am not able either to help a friend or hurt an enemy . \nWhere you go , there I will go also : that is my resolve . ' \nVictoria Cross , Military Cross and Bar , First World War ` Great battle at 3am . \nTurks captured large portion of our trench . \nLieutenant Hamilton shot dead . \nI led a section of men and recaptured the trench . \nI bayoneted two Turks , shot five , took three prisoners and cleared the whole trench . \nI held the trench alone for 15 minutes against a heavy attack . ' \nWith these words acting lance-corporal Albert Jacka , 22 , described the circumstances of his nomination for a VC , the first awarded to an Australian in the Great War for his actions at Gallipoli . \nAmerican , Congressional Medal of Honour , Distinguished Service Cross , Second World War One of 12 children of a poor sharecropper in Texas , Murphy was initially rejected by the Marines and Paratroopers after lying about his age . \nOnly 5ft 5ins , when he finally enlisted in the army at 17 , he became a rifleman - and would become America 's most decorated soldier in the Second World War . \nIn one extraordinary action near Ramatuelle , France , in 1944 , he single-handedly destroyed several German positions - earning him the Distinguished Service Cross . \nBritish , OBE , Victoria Cross awarded posthumously , Falklands Lieutenant-Colonel Jones was commanding 2nd battalion The Parachute regiment in the Falklands when they were held up by a resilient enemy position on an important ridge . \nSeizing a sub-machine gun , Jones charged the nearest enemy position . \nAs he ran up a short slope he fell , but picked himself up . \nHe was hit from another trench which he outflanked and fell dying . \nA short time later a company of the battalion attacked and the enemy quickly surrendered .

'' \nReports that Apache was seeking $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion for the purchase helped boost BP 's U.S. shares from midday . \nThe shares then rose further on the initial test results and ended up 7.6 percent at $ 38.92 . \n`` It 's been one of those headline things we 've heard for 87 days , lots of people waiting for some good news , '' said John Massey , portfolio manager at Sunamerica Asset Management in Jersey City , New Jersey . \nAnalysts surveyed by Reuters Insider predict that BP will spend between $ 63 billion to $ 100 billion over the next 15 years in fines , cleanup costs and legal costs . \nBP 's shares have been ravaged since the well rupture , with $ 100 billion in market value being knocked off at one stage , before a three-week rally sparked by takeover talk , speculation about investment by a sovereign wealth fund and hopes that the well would be capped . \nThe news that BP had finally stopped the leak -- at least during the test -- was a bit of good news for the British company , which has seen its share value plummet and reputation battered since the April rig explosion that killed 11 workers and led to the spill of millions of gallons of oil . \nBP also faced new measures in the U.S. Congress . \nLawmakers are mulling a range of new laws that could require tougher safety regulations on offshore drilling or bar companies like BP from new offshore exploration leases . \n-LRB- ID : nN15210454 -RRB- The U.S. government , which has vowed to make BP pay for fixing the well and all cleanup efforts , told the oil giant that it was responsible for paying all royalties on the oil it is collecting from the ruptured well . \n-LRB- ID : nN15220646 -RRB- Currently , energy companies pay the government a royalty rate of up to 18.75 percent of the value of the oil and gas drilled in offshore tracts . \nThrough its containment systems , BP has collected or burned more than 800,000 barrels of oil . \nThe Gulf spill has soiled hundreds of miles -LRB- km -RRB- of shoreline , shut down about a third of Gulf fisheries and hurt tourism and fishing in all five U.S. Gulf states . \nIt has also created problems for Obama as the government works to respond to the crisis while area residents struggle financially . \nIn an issue unrelated to the spill , but illustrating the pressure BP faces in the United States , the company confirmed on Thursday that it had lobbied the British government to speed up a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya in late 2007 . \n-LRB- For a fact box on BP in Libya , see -LRB- ID : nLDE66E0ZO -RRB- -RRB- In August 2009 , Britain released a Libyan convicted of blowing up a U.S. plane , angering the United States . \nMany of the 270 dead in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing were American . \n-LRB- ID : nWLA8411 -RRB- The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said it would hold a hearing on the issue on July 29 . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nHopefully it is much more !!

{"txt": "God spoke to Moses through a burning bush on Mount Horeb . \nHe apparently speaks to Republicans through a spewing oil well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . \nRep. Tom Cole -LRB- R-Okla . -RRB- \ndelivered the startling revelation last week that the BP oil spill was caused not by a faulty blowout preventer but by the Almighty Himself . \nHe explained the spill to an Oklahoma City radio station like this : '' Acts of God are acts of God .

Rick Perry , a fellow Republican , who last month said of the oil spill : `` From time to time there are going to be things that occur that are acts of God that can not be prevented . '' \nSo if God is responsible for the spill , and BP is the spill 's `` responsible party , '' what these men are really saying is that BP is ... God ? \nThis interpretation is at the very cutting edge of ecclesiastical thought . \nIn the past , our Heavenly Father has involved himself in floods , droughts and the occasional earthquake , but this may be his first foray into industrial disasters . \nThe Valdez spill was an act of Exxon . \nBhopal was an act of Union Carbide . \nBut the BP spill is an act of God . \nOiliness is next to godliness . \nForgive this blasphemy , but is it perhaps time to question the Doctrine of Boardroom Infallibility ? \nIn Washington , belief in corporate divinity has become a bipartisan religion , and it 's polytheistic : Lawmakers , despite the occasional bit of populist rhetoric , routinely provide generous offerings to the automotive , aerospace , financial , pharmaceutical and insurance industries , along with petroleum . \nAn article by The Post 's Dan Eggen explains why : More than 1,400 former members of Congress , staffers and federal employees registered as lobbyists in the financial services sector alone since the start of 2009 , according to a study by Public Citizen and the Center for Responsive Politics . \nMany of these lobbyists , of course , moonlight as fundraising captains for lawmakers . \nNo wonder politicians have got the corporate religion . \nRep. Don Young -LRB- R-Alaska -RRB- , furthering the act-of-God view , asserted that `` this is not an environmental disaster '' in the gulf `` because it is a natural phenomena . '' \nRand Paul , the GOP Senate candidate in Kentucky , said the administration 's vow to keep a boot on the throat of BP is '' un-American . '' \nFormer GOP presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani said the criminal investigation of BP is a `` mistake . '' \nDemocrats have been only slightly less devout . \nThey 're giving no serious consideration to the demand from some on the left , including Robert Reich , to put BP into temporary receivership . \nThe administration 's criminal investigation of BP has little chance of getting executives locked up . \nBP CEO Tony Hayward wo n't even commit to suspending BP 's dividend -LRB- more than $ 10 billion last year -RRB- , as some Democratic senators have demanded , and he put the clean-up cost at a paltry $ 3 billion over six months , far less than what many analysts say the real cost will be . \nThat 's just one more contemptuous utterance from a man who has already dubbed the spill `` tiny , '' called environmental damage `` very modest , '' denied the existence of underwater oil plumes , suggested that sickened oil cleanup workers had food poisoning and complained that he wanted his '' life back . '' \nAmericans feel the outrage more than their leaders do . \nA recent Gallup poll shows that 73 percent think BP has done a poor or very poor job . \nOverall , Americans are just as distrustful of corporations as they are of the federal government . \nA Pew Research Center poll released in April found that 64 percent think large corporations are having a negative effect on the country , compared with 65 percent who say that of the government . \nYet the faux populists of the Tea Party train their anger on the government while giving corporations a pass . \nAnd Obama , accused of being a socialist , has actually been a no-fault capitalist , cleaning up corporate messes without winning much in the way of new laws to prevent a recurrence . \nToo many corporations have survived their misdeeds with no more than an angry hearing or two : GM , Chrysler , Toyota , Goldman Sachs , Citibank , Bank of America , Massey Energy . \nThe legislative dressing-down obviously is n't sufficient deterrent . \nNeither is firing the CEO , because he 's invariably replaced by another just like him . \nPardon the sacrilege , but for a real deterrent , it 's time to institute a corporate death penalty -- and BP is a perfect candidate . \nThat sort of retribution would be divine .

after staging its biggest weekly gain in 2-1\\/2 years last week . \nSharp volatility in stocks , which has marked trading in recent weeks , underscored investor nervousness . \nThe turmoil largely reflects persistent worries that the United States may fall back into recession , as well as the threat that sovereign debt problems in euro zone peripheral countries could spread to the larger economies . \nThe cost for euro zone banks to borrow money from one another rose again , heading back toward their highest levels since late 2008 as U.S. banks remained wary of lending to European

'' \nThe Syrian opposition has called for the clause to be scrapped , along with another that says the president can only be nominated by his Baath Party as well as numerous laws passed in the last 50 years which they say allow Assad and his security apparatus to practice repression and corruption with impunity . \nThe Baath banned opposition when it took power in a 1963 coup . \nThe party organization has lost power and status in the last decade to Assad family members , some selected cohorts and the secret police , a bloc now underpinning the power structure . \nNew laws issued by Assad in the past three months permit `` parties committed to democratic principles '' and established an election commission . \nBut they also preserved quotas that retain the majority of seats for farmers and workers , whose representatives are drawn from state-controlled unions . \nSyria 's current parliament , a rubber stamp body , does not have a single opposition figure . \nHuman rights activists say that the official legal changes have not stopped repression on the ground that has killed 3,000 civilians or tackled extraordinary decrees that make the secret police , which rights activists say is responsible for most of the killings during the unrest , unanswerable to any law . \nThey point to recent laws that toughened punishments for people demonstrating without a license and widened Assad 's scope to invoke nationwide military mobilization to include `` internal disturbances '' and to punish army deserters . \nSyrian troops and police shot dead at least eight people protesting against Assad in the last 48 hours , activists said . \nThe United Nations called for international protection for civilians from a crackdown it said could lead to civil war between Syria 's majority Sunni Muslims and members of Assad 's minority Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam . \nThe shootings , near Aleppo and in Damascus and its suburbs , occurred as protesters took to the streets as they have done many times since Syria 's uprising began in March , inspired by popular revolts that have ousted three Arab leaders this year . \n-LRB- Reporting by Khaled Yacoub Oweis , Amman newsroom ; Editing by Mark Heinrich -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/syriancrisis_reuters/rsd/SyrianCrisis_reuters__2011-10-15__117.rsd.txt"}
{"txt": "U.S. Northeast digs out from blizzard , tornado strikes in South . \nFull Article Family 's death illustrates divided Libya SOUQ AL-JUMAA , Libya | Fri Aug 5 , 2011 8:12 am IST SOUQ AL-JUMAA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A few kilometers from the front-lines , some of the youngest victims of Libya 's civil war lay on Thursday in simple coffins , testimony to the toll of the conflict in which neither side boasts a clear advantage . \nMusatafa al-Marabit , his feet bandaged and his clothes spotted with blood , was led sobbing from the three coffins containing the bodies of his wife and two young sons . \nThey were reportedly killed by an airstrike early on Thursday in their home west of Zlitan , the strategically located city some 160 kilometres -LRB- 100 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli that has become Libya 's third front . \nIn a conflict in which murkiness and mutual suspicions abound , foreign journalists were bussed to Zlitan , where nearby rebels are battling Gaddafi 's forces on a fluctuating front - line , to film the remains of Marabit 's house and to a nearby burial site to examine the blood-stained bodies of his boys . \nMarabit 's wife Ibtisam , who officials said was killed alongside her children while her husband attended morning prayers , lay in another coffin which was unopened in keeping with Islamic tradition . \nFor supporters of Gaddafi , who has defied expectations since Western powers began their air campaign in March by clinging defiantly to power , the incident was proof of the brutality of foreign aggressors who dared to strike civilians during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . \n`` They are attacking Islam ; there is no other explanation , '' neighbor Atiya Mohamed shouted as he stood among the rubble that was Marabit 's home . \nYet NATO and the rebels hoping to seize Zlitan and eventually capture the fortified capital will likely portray it as more evidence of Gaddafi stationing civilians at military sites as he seeks to avoid further damage to his fighting prowess . \nThe Gaddafi government routinely reports deaths inflicted by NATO airstrikes , whose victims it calls ` martyrs , ' but Thursday 's events marked the first time in weeks officials had offered details of the identities of those it said were killed by NATO bombs . \nIt was also the first time in weeks it had offered journalists an opportunity to report on human victims of airstrikes at close range . \nAfter the attack , NATO acknowledged it had hit a military command site in the area around 6:30 a.m. , approximately the time officials and neighbors said Marabit 's house was struck . \n`` We always take seriously allegations of civilian casualties and are looking into it , but we have no evidence at this stage that this was caused by an air strike , '' a NATO official in Naples said . \nWhile there was no evidence of any military activity among the shattered cinderblock and cushions strewn around Marabit 's destroyed home , rebels fighting for control of Zlitan raised questions about the building 's true use . \nIf confirmed , the attack near Zlitan would not be the first time since Western-led airstrikes began in Libya in late March that NATO activity has resulted in civilian deaths . \nIn June , NATO admitted it destroyed a house in Tripoli in which Libyan officials said nine civilians were killed . \nShortly afterwards , the Libyan government reported almost 20 people were killed in a strike on the home of a member of Libya 's 12-strong Revolutionary Command Council , led by Gaddafi . \nMore such incidents could undermine support for a campaign already on shaky ground in some NATO nations , where financial pressures have added to doubts about a campaign that has yet to bring peace in Libya . \nLibyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said the incident would stoke anti-Western rage . \n`` What NATO is doing is very dangerous . \nIt is planting the seeds of hatred in the hearts of millions of Libyans , '' he said . \nResidents of Zlitan and Souq al-Jumaa , on the town 's western outskirts , brushed aside rebel claims this week Gaddafi 's opponents were on the cusp of capturing the town . \nZlitan was quiet as foreign journalists toured the center of the town on Thursday afternoon , as fasting Muslims rested or stayed indoors due to the heat . \nBut the silence was interrupted regularly by the thuds of shelling or rocket attacks just to the east . \nGovernment minders took journalists to see several other sites apparently hit by NATO strikes , including a large school and the local law college , where among rubble and law books lay empty ammunition boxes and green military clothing in the dirt . \nMohamed Salim , minding a deserted toy store , said some Zlitan residents had fled and power cuts had become more frequent as fighting had increased in the past few weeks . \nBut he said he was n't afraid of the advance of rebels . \n`` I only fear god , '' he said . \n-LRB- Editing by Douglas Hamilton and Sophie Hares -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/libyawar_reuters/rsd/LibyaWar_reuters__2011-08-05__89.rsd.txt"}
{"txt": "BEIRUT | Mon Nov 14 , 2011 12:21 pm EST BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syria 's President Bashar al-Assad , self-styled champion of Arab unity , faces deepening isolation after fellow Arab states announced sanctions on Syria for his eight-month crackdown on protests calling for his overthrow . \nFor the leader of a country which , under 40 years of Assad family rule , has portrayed itself as the principal defender of Arab rights , the Arab League 's move on Saturday was a wounding blow . \nHis military crackdown on the uprising , in which the United Nations estimates 3,500 people have been killed , had already alienated former ally Turkey and led Western nations to impose sanctions and call for him to step down . \nBut the surprise decision by the Arab League to suspend Syria and announce political and economic sanctions marked a dramatic new low in Assad 's international standing , leaving him ever more dependent on a close alliance with non-Arab Iran . \nAssad 's determination to crush an uprising which he blames on Islamist militants backed by foreign powers , coupled with the resilience of street protests and the emergence of an armed insurgency , has made Syria 's uprising one of the most intractable conflicts of this year 's Arab revolts . \nHis use of tanks to seize back control of the city of Hama in August revived memories of his father 's crushing of an uprising nearly 30 years ago , and led U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to accuse him of `` losing all sense of humanity . '' \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe warned Assad last month that the `` barbaric repression '' in Syria would `` end with the fall of the regime , '' and even ally Russia said he risked a `` sad fate '' unless he ended the violence and implemented reforms . \n`` If he just defiantly continues to defy signals from the Arab world and international community it 's increasingly grim for him , '' said Rami Khouri , a Beirut-based Middle East analyst . \nJust weeks before the uprising erupted in March , the 46-year-old leader said Syria was immune from the rebellions which have overthrown the leaders of Tunisia , Egypt and Libya because its foreign policy was closely aligned with popular Arab sentiment . \nIn a speech at Damascus University in June , one of just a handful of addresses he has made since the unrest began , Assad justified the crackdown and said he was overwhelmed with support from Syrians he had met to discuss the crisis . \n`` The love I felt from those people who represent most of the Syrian people is something I have never felt at any stage of my life , '' he said . \nIn fact the unrest has polarized Syria . \nMany demonstrators now openly chant for Assad 's execution -- a scene unimaginable eight months ago -- but he is still able to rally huge crowds for state-organized demonstrations and retains a core of support particularly among minority Christians and his own Alawite sect . \nAlongside the military campaign against protests , Assad has lifted a state of emergency in place for nearly 50 years , approved laws to allow parties other than his ruling Baath Party to be established , and promised dialogue with the opposition . \nThe characteristically ambiguous stance , mixing iron-fisted security while holding out the promise of change , helped to mute international criticism in the early stages of the uprising . \nBut critics said his decision to send troops into several cities in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan four months ago showed he had chosen the `` security option '' to crush the protests rather than address their grievances . \nTall and softly spoken Assad was thrust into the spotlight after the death of his elder brother Basel in a car crash in 1994 . \nCalled back from medical studies in London , he gradually assumed a higher profile and six years later inherited the presidency when his father died after ruling Syria for 30 years . \nTo allow the 34-year-old to assume power , Syria 's parliament met hastily to amend a constitutional clause requiring the president to be at least 40 years old . \nIn office , he held out the prospect of reforming one of the Arab world 's most tightly controlled states and oversaw a short-lived move toward political freedoms before his `` Damascus Spring '' faded amid a wave of repression and arrests . \nAssad also strengthened his father 's strategic alliance with Iran and supported militant Islamist groups including the Palestinian Hamas and the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah . \nHe ended nearly three decades of Syrian military presence in neighboring Lebanon under international pressure following the 2005 assassination of Lebanese statesman Rafik al-Hariri . \nBut the collapse in January of Beirut 's pro-Western government , led by Hariri 's son , was the latest sign that Assad had clawed back influence in Lebanon , one of only two countries to oppose Saturday 's Arab League move . \nAlthough he backs anti-Israel militants , he also pursued indirect peace talks with Israel and , despite continued Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war , ensured the front line usually remained quiet . \nAt home he started liberalizing the economy , easing decades of central control and allowing limited foreign investment . \nBut while those around him , including his cousin Rami Makhlouf , acquired great wealth , ordinary Syrians saw few benefits . \nHe also maintained the grip on power held by his family and Alawite sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim state . \nHis brother Maher commands the Republican Guard and is the second most powerful man in the country while brother-in-law Assef Shawkat is deputy chief-of-staff of the armed forces . \nAssad 's wife Asma , who grew up in London and worked at an investment bank , helped him try to project a softer , liberal and modern image to the outside world , countering Syria 's reputation as a repressive police state . \nHe insists that he remains in touch with his people even after a decade in power and eight months of trying to crush a determined uprising . \n`` I live a normal life . \nI drive my own car , we have neighbors , I take my kids to school , '' he told the British Sunday Telegraph newspaper last month . \n`` That 's why I am popular .

'' \nOffshore oil drilling is a key part of Obama 's efforts to rejig the country 's energy policy and a needed sweetener for gaining Republican support for a bill in the Senate . \nBut the spill has forced him and fellow Democrats to rethink their support for such an expansion , which many environmentalists oppose . \n`` Extraction is more expensive and it is going to be inherently more risky , '' Obama said . \n`` That 's part of the reason you never heard me say , ` drill , baby , drill , ' because we ca n't drill our way out of the problem . '' \nThe Obama administration ordered a halt in new drilling permits after BP 's oil rig , owned by Transocean -LRB- RIG . \nS , exploded in the Gulf on April 20 . \nSome U.S. lawmakers have called on the administration to lift the permit ban , at least for exploration in the shallow waters of the Gulf while keeping it in place in deeper waters where BP was operating . \nMike Breard , an analyst at Hodges Capital Management , said the decision would force companies to move rigs to places such as Brazil , forcing the United States to import more and increasing the possibility of tanker accidents . \n`` You 're trading a risk of one type of spill for another type of spill , '' Breard said . \nObama has established a presidential commission to investigate the causes of the spill , which by government estimates is the country 's largest ever . \nHis announcement on Thursday was meant to amplify his administration 's response before that panel draws its own conclusions on what went wrong . \nThe moratorium on permits to drill new deepwater wells will continue for a period of six months while the commission does its work . \nPolitical fallout has not been limited to legislation . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar said Liz Birnbaum , the head of Minerals Management Service , which oversees U.S. offshore oil drilling , had resigned . \nObama said he had learned of the resignation on Thursday morning . \nHe declared that reforms are needed in the government 's process for approving oil drilling permits and said the MMS suffered from a relationship with the oil industry that was `` scandalously close . '' \nObama has come under increasing pressure to stop the spill and halt its environmental and economic consequences for Gulf states . \nBP , which has been publicly scolded by the president , was working on Thursday to plug the leaking well in a procedure known as `` top kill . '' \nObama promised to hold BP accountable in the catastrophic spill and said his administration would do everything necessary to protect and restore the coast . \n`` We 're exploring any reasonable strategies to try and save the Gulf from a spill that may otherwise last until the relief wells are finished and that 's a process that could take months , '' Obama said .

'' \nThe military detention facility , its facade peppered with bullet holes , was set up by the rebels early in the conflict to house government troops captured during fighting around Libya . \nMost of the 75 detainees are soldiers and officers but a handful of people , like Abdullah , were civilians . \nSnatched as Gaddafi loyalists in the confusion of the early days of the conflict , they are now stuck in limbo , unable to prove their loyalties and go back to their families . \nSome , like Abdullah , are bitter and disillusioned . \n`` No one has been charged with anything here . \nWe have been told that we are here for security reasons , as POWs , '' Abdullah , who asked not to use his surname , said in fluent English . \n`` Once I talked to my family . \nOnce , a month ago . \nI spoke to my brother . \nWe were instructed not to give any information about how we are being treated . \nI told them I am okay , in a safe place , that 's it , '' he added . \nFor their captors , they are the inevitable victims of a messy and protracted war . \nPrison authorities have promised to release everyone -- both civilians and soldiers -- once the war is over and there is a proper mechanism for their departure . \n`` They all come from their tribes . \nWhen Gaddafi dies or flees , we will have a big tribal meeting and people will come here from their tribes and they will take their people away , '' said Captain Tariq Muftah , 40 , a senior prison warden . \nBefore becoming a prison , the facility housed administrative offices under Gaddafi 's rule , rebels said . \nBroken furniture was scattered around its crumbling rooms and corridors when Reuters was allowed to visit it this week . \nSmall cells housing up to five men lined the main corridor . \nDetainees sat in their cells on old striped rugs and blankets . \nSurrounded by heaps of clothes and rubbish , they stared blankly at passing visitors through iron bars . \nSome smoked and played cards . \nFlies buzzed around in the thick , stale air . \nPictures of helicopter gunships were scribbled on the walls . \nPeople 's faces were gaunt . \nSome refused to speak altogether . \nGritting his teeth and unable to hold back his tears , one man , his eyes swollen and cheeks drawn , whispered that he used to be a fighter pilot . \nThen he turned away to face the wall . \nPrison wardens accompanying Reuters confirmed people 's stories . \nReuters was not allowed to take video or still images . \nSitting on a grubby mattress in the corridor , Abdusalam Osman , 23 , said he was working in a car parts workshop near Ajdabiyah when he was seized by Gaddafi soldiers in March . \nHe said he was subsequently released and returned to the rebel-held east , only to be detained this time by rebel forces suspicious of his experience while in government detention . \n`` I am not a soldier . \nI work in a workshop fixing cars . \nSo now we are here , '' he said , pointing at three other men sitting nearby who he said were also civilians from his home town . \n`` Revolutionaries caught me . \nThey said : We are not sure you are on our side , you are coming from Gaddafi 's side , so you are going to prison . \nI believe in the revolution . \nEvery day they tell me : Tomorrow you will be released , '' he added with a shrug . \nHuman Rights Watch , whose researchers have visited the facility , said prisoners were generally being treated well . \n`` There have been some problems at the point of capture . \nA few detainees told us they were mistreated or shot after they were caught on the frontlines ... , '' Sidney Kwiram of Human Rights Watch told Reuters . \n`` It is critical that the opposition authorities demonstrate unambiguous leadership on how to treat captured Gaddafi forces and that they continue to underline their message about humane treatment , including to their fighters on the frontlines . '' \nSpeaking to Reuters as their captors looked on , most Gaddafi soldiers said they now supported the revolution . \n`` I was told in -LRB- my hometown of -RRB- Sirt as a soldier that Benghazi was full of al Qaeda . \nSo I went to fight them , '' said Nasrdin Mohammed , an army sergeant detained on March 15 . \n`` Then I realized I was on the wrong side . \nNow I just want freedom .

Bush 's remarks delivered Friday at the White House on financial assistance to troubled auto makers : For years , America 's automakers have faced serious challenges ; burdensome costs , shrinking share of the market and declining profits . \nIn recent months , the global financial crisis has made these challenges even more severe . \nNow , some U.S. auto executives say that their companies are nearing collapse and that the only way they can buy time to restructure is with help from the federal government . \nIt 's a difficult situation that involves fundamental questions about the proper role of government . \nOn the one hand , government has the responsibility not to undermine the private enterprise system . \nOn the other hand , government has a responsibility to safeguard the broader health and stability of our economy . \nAddressing the challenges in the auto industry requires us to balance these two responsibilities . \nIf we were to allow the free market to take its course now , it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers . \nUnder ordinary economic circumstances , I would say this is the price that failed companies must pay . \nAnd I would not favor intervening to prevent the automakers from going out of business . \nBut these are not ordinary circumstances . \nIn the midst of a financial crisis and a recession , allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action . \nThe question is how we can best give it a chance to succeed . \nSome argue the wisest path is to allow the auto companies to reorganize through Chapter 11 provisions of our bankruptcy laws and provide federal loans to keep them operating while they try to restructure under the supervision of a bankruptcy court . \nBut given the current state of the auto industry and the economy , Chapter 11 is unlikely to work for American automakers at this time . \nAmerican consumers understand why . \nIf you hear that a car company is suddenly going into bankruptcy , you worry that parts and servicing will not be available and you question the value of your warranty . \nWith consumers hesitant to buy new cars from struggling automakers , it would be more difficult for auto companies to recover . \nAdditionally , the financial crisis brought the auto companies to the brink of bankruptcy much faster than they could have anticipated . \nAnd they have not made the legal and financial preparations necessary to carry out an orderly bankruptcy proceeding that could lead to a successful restructuring . \nThe convergence of these factors means there is too great a risk that bankruptcy now would lead to a disorderly liquidation of American auto companies . \nMy economic advisers believe that such a collapse would deal an unacceptably painful blow to hardworking Americans far beyond the auto industry . \nIt would worsen a weak job market and exacerbate the financial crisis . \nIt could send our suffering economy into a deeper and longer recession .

{"txt": "By Fawaz Gerges Middle East analyst , LSE Protests have been staged in front of Syrian embassies across the world The Syrian regime has dramatically intensified its crackdown against the protesters in an effort to crush the opposition . \nThe country is now on the brink of all-out war . \nResidents say thousands of heavily armed soldiers , backed by tanks , are swarming the streets of their cities and towns . \nIn Deraa on Sunday , witnesses said that security forces had opened fire in the city , shooting indiscriminately , even though no protests were being held at the time . \nAlready , more than 300 people have been killed in a crackdown across the country , human rights groups say . \nHundreds more have been arrested . \nBut this is only a glimpse of the bloodshed we are likely to witness in Syria . \nUnlike in Tunisia or Egypt there is no daylight between the Assad regime and the Syrian army '' The Baathist regime , facing one of the gravest crises in its 40-year history , has unleashed its security apparatus , including army units , to try to break the will of the opposition . \nIt was a tactic used by former President Hafez al-Assad , father of the current leader , Bashar al-Assad , against opposition forces led by the Muslim Brotherhood in Hama in 1982 . \nSome 10,000 Syrians died as the town was virtually flattened by elite government troops . \nIt is well known that unlike in Tunisia or Egypt there is no daylight between the Assad regime and the Syrian army , particularly the presidential guard , a powerful elite force . \nDespite tentative reports about emerging fissures within some army units , the majority of Syrian special forces come from the minority Alawite sect of President Assad and are the spearhead of his regime . \nThere are many reports of crackdowns around Syria , despite the lifting of an emergency law last week They are in a fight for their own survival , as well as the survival of their community , not just the political leadership . \nWe will not see killings on the same scale as Hama , but it is clear that the regime is prepared to use massive force to crush the protesters . \nThe regime has other supporters - members of the Alawite and other minority groups , including Christians , Druze , and some Sunnis whom the regime has co-opted into the power structure over the years . \nBut the intensity and depth of the social uprising has exposed a major rift between state and society . \nAs more innocent blood is spilled , the divide deepens with devastating repercussions for social harmony and peace . \nEven in Syria , which has one of the most repressive security apparatus in the Arab world , the fear factor has gone . \nTens of thousands of Syrians have challenged the authority of the Syrian government . \nContrary to President Assad 's assertions , this is not a foreign conspiracy . \nIt is an internal uprising that encompasses multiple segments of Syrian society - middle-class professionals , human rights activists , the disadvantaged poor who have been hurt by years of drought and unemployment , and members of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood . \nThey are disillusioned by the fact that , more than decade after he assumed power upon the death of his father , the younger President Assad has not carried out many promised reforms . \nThese include opening up the political system , relaxing the heavy hand of the Mukhabarat -LRB- security services -RRB- and ending the monopoly of the ruling Baath Party on political life . \nUnlike his recent claims , Syria is not immune to the mutating democratic virus sweeping the Middle East . \nThe fact that it has reached Syria speaks volumes about the changing mood and psychology in the Arab world . \nThere is a new Arab citizen who feels empowered and emboldened - and determined to have a say in how their government is run . \nBut we have not yet seen in Syria the massive crowds along the lines of Tunisia , Egypt , Yemen and Libya . \nMany people worry about Syria being plunged into all-out sectarian war , like neighbouring Iraq . \nThey believe that President Assad could still rise up to the challenge and enact real change . \nThe protesters have worked hard to stress a non-sectarian , non-tribal , non-violent agenda . \nAlthough it is too early to know the exact composition of the protesters , a new Syrian identity appears to be emerging , anchored in inclusiveness and ethnic tolerance . \nOn Tuesday , more than 100 Syrian intellectuals who live abroad signed a petition condemning the killings and the brutal measures . \nThe intellectuals include Sunnis , Alawites , Christians , Druze and Kurds . \nThis is a testament to the maturity of Syrian society , despite decades of repression . \nThe response of the international community is important to impress upon the regime a sense of urgency to engage with the opposition and the necessity to resist the use of force against unarmed protesters . \nThe Obama administration has begun drawing up targeted financial sanctions against President Assad and senior members of his inner circle . \nAlthough the Western response is crucial , Syrians themselves will determine what happens in Syria in the next few weeks and months . \nThis is an internal crisis that pits the regime against critical social forces . \nA fierce battle of wills will determine the outcome of this structural crisis . \nFor now , the umbilical cord between the security apparatus and the political leadership has not been cut . \nThis is likely to allow President Assad to weather the storm in the short-term . \nBut in the medium and long term , the uprising could take on a life of its own . \nThe more the killings and bloodshed , the more it will fuel further protests . \nAs more Alawites and other fence-sitters step forward to join the protesters , the security forces will think twice about firing on unarmed civilians . \nThis is what tipped the balance of power in Yemen , where senior army officers defected to the side of the people as the protest movement grew . \nWhen President Ali Abdullah Saleh realized that he could no longer rely on the army , it spelled the beginning of the end . \nThe Syrian crisis will simmer , it will go several rounds . \nRegardless of whether the regime survives or not - and it is most likely to survive - President Assad will emerge deeply injured and weakened . \nFor now , though , the odds are against the protesters . \nFawaz Gerges is a Professor of Middle Eastern Politics and International Relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .

'' \nBut remember that pregnancy is also a risk factor for seasonal flu , especially in the last trimester . \nFlu poses a threat both to the mother and to the unborn child . \nAmong the complications , the fever associated with flu can lead to a premature delivery . \nHealth advisers recommended three years ago that pregnant women should be among the groups offered a seasonal flu jab . \nWhen a vaccine for H1N1 swine flu becomes available in the autumn , pregnant women may well be among the first `` at risk '' groups offered the jab . \nWhat about antiviral drugs and pregnancy ? \nDuring pregnancy , the concern with any drug is that it may pass through the placenta and affect the baby . \nThere is a risk factor especially during the first trimester . \nOseltamivir -LRB- currently best known as the brand name Tamiflu -RRB- is not usually recommended for pregnant women because the side-effects are unknown . \nBut the lesser-known inhaled drug Relenza -LRB- a brand name for zanamivir -RRB- can be prescribed on medical advice , according to the Department of Health . \n`` An expert group reviewed the risk of antiviral treatment in pregnancy , which is extremely small - much smaller than the risk posed by the symptoms of swine flu . '' \nThere are more details on pregnancy and swine flu on the government health pages . \nAt 11:07 am on 15 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Give pregnant women massive priority . \nThe health authorities are dealing with two people , not one . \nPregnancy and childbirth is a high risk time all of the time . \nIf it is unwise to give certain antiviral drugs to pregnant women then it stands to reason , to reduce unnecessary contact with the rest of us until such time as the baby is born . \nWe can reduce the risk to pregnant mums by keeping well away if we have been in contact with or have this new flu . \nShopping for food online is a bit safer than the weekly scrum in the supermarket . \nGet someone else to do the supermarket run . \nAnti natal appointments could be run from an alternative location away from the germ ridden doctors surgery . \nLuckily , most hospitals for childbirth are set apart from the general hospitals . \nHome deliveries are risky at the best of times and should not be an alternative for safe hospital delivery , where specialists are always at hand . \nPregnant mums may already have a toddler at the local nursery , playgroup or school . \nOther mums could reduce the risk of flu contact , by making sure their own children do not have symptoms of flu or other infectious diseases before sending them of to school each morning . \nIt only takes two minutes to check a temperature . \nSchools and nurseries could be more pro-active and less politically correct and simply refuse to allow a child to attend if they are obviously ill . \nThe temptation will be , to allow a child back to nursery before the child has got over the infectious stage , if the child appears apparently well . \nDo n't forget , if you knowingly take risks , you risk the health of others . \nThat 's the first time - as far as I 'm aware - that anyone from government , or any journalist , has actually admitted that there may well be a significant difference between the ` official ' figure and the real figure of infections . \nNow , as has already been stated on these blogs , the official figure is the number of reported and confirmed cases - and it may be relevant to consider that some , perhaps even many , of these persons have recovered from the infection and would no longer be an infection risk to others . \nSo in terms of people assessing how likely it is that they will come into direct or indirect contact with an infectious person and thereby risk becoming infected - these figures are particularly useless in many respects . \nAnd is n't that really what people want some idea about ? \nThe risk to them ? \nIn fact , I almost wonder why the government is bothering to constantly publish these figures and the media report them ! \nAt 3:04 pm on 15 Jun 2009 , 32weeks wrote : Well , not even all newspapers today mentioned that the woman was pregnant when she contracted the virus , let alone that she gave birth to premature baby before passing away days later . \nThere is very little information about the virus and pregnant women in general , and I notice that even though there is a lot of data already collected by WHO about the cases -LRB- and disproportinately high number of cases involving pregnant women -RRB- the official documents regarding the virus have not been updated since they were first issued . \nIt is appalling that only with the first lethal case some more information is siphoning through the media , though barely adequate . \nHere is an idea to chew on . \nA mad , random , scientific idea is that bacteria make the rain fall . \nThe info is on the BBC site today and is on radio 4 tonight at 9 pm . \nAs a child , when it rained , I was always told to wear a rain mac , dry my hair thoroughly , take an umbrella with me or I ` would catch my death of cold ' if I got wet in the rain . \nIt always used to puzzle me because the same restrictions were not in place when I went to the beach and enjoyed bathing in the sea . \nAre viruses able to temporarily host on the bacteria that ` seed ' the rain and possibly make rain fall ? \nIt is interesting , because if bacteria can alter the temperature that rain freezes , then it might explain why antifreeze works or why salt prevents water freezing at zero . \nThe bacteria are being killed or attenuated by the salt and alcohol . \nFergus , I would echo Sutara 's comment above . \nFar more relevant than the historic number of recorded cases is the number of recent cases within any geography . \nIt may be , for example , that H1N1 has practically died out in some regions or countries that have previously reported cases , but we the public , ca n't tell . \nCould the BBC please issue a revised map of cases within the past 10 days , or some medically relevant period ? \nIt ca n't be that difficult to produce based on the statistics published already . \nAt 07:56 am on 16 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : The double tragedy has moved me to tears this morning . \nMy deepest condolences for the family and friends . \nAt the end of the day , people matter , not maps , not numbers , not who is right and who is wrong , just people . \nI completely agree that this family now has to try to come to terms with an especially tragic situation , at a time when they expected to be celebrating the baby 's arrival home . \nAnd it is because people matter that many just want some clear idea about the risks involved , presented to them in a straight-forward way , neither hyped up , nor dumbed down . \nIn the final analysis most people want to be self-determining and want the information so that they themselves can `` manage '' the risks involved to the best of their ability . \nUnfortunately , probably for a whole number of reasons including the operational cultures of Health Trusts and civil servants , the information being published is n't actually particularly helpful to the metaphorical man on the Clapham omnibus . \nPeople do n't want `` command and control '' from the authorities , they just want clear useful informaton . \nAt 08:37 am on 16 Jun 2009 , Sutara wrote : Additionally , they want to understand basic things like how long people are infectious for , so that they do n't accidentally endanger themselves or those near and dear to them - especially if that would involve anyone from a ` high-risk ' group . \nYou know , most of the decision-making that will make most difference to managing this outbreak , wo n't be done by doctors , nurses , or a government Health Secretary , it will be done by ordinary people in homes , offices , shops , etc. , up and down the country . \nAt risk of sounding cynical , the authorities have lost control of this infection , so it 's time to empower the ordinary people to deal with it the best they can . \nAt 10:13 am on 16 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Sutara , I understand your concern about incubation and infection times . \nI am not an expert on this matter but I have information about flu types in general . \nMy information is from a published source , not intended for the general public but for health agency workers in the field . \nNormal flu has an incubation time of about 2 days which can stretch out from 1-4 days . \nA new flu like H1N1 may behave differently and could range from 2-5 days , possibly 8 , who knows ? \nInfection time for normal flu is up to 5 days in adults and stretching out to about 10 days in children . \nAgain , this is all depending on circumstances . \nIt has been known for flu to last from 2-3 weeks , but that would be an exception and not the rule . \nHow do you package that information into a sensible format that is not overreactive , straight forward and does n't confuse or alarm people ? \nBeing overcautious is as harmful as not cautious enough ! \nWe all have to interact with each other and continue normal lives . \nThe economy is dependent on our ability to make sensible decisions and be available for work . \nA good piece of advice would to maintain a social distance of 1 meter wherever possible . \nThe flu virus has difficulty infecting you at a further distance . \nMasks are suitable only for preventing your sneeze mixture of bodily excretion and virus , expelling out and jumping the 1 meter distance to infect someone else . \nA clearer idea of incubation time and infection time for H1N1 may be coming out of America where they would have been busy gathering statistics to plan for future outbreaks . \nI reckon it 's quite easy - you find a term , say ` stimated current infection rate ' . \nBased on the reported positive cases and when they were reported , you publish a figure , country by county in the UK , of the estimated current percentage of the population who are currently infected , perhaps that would be those whose infection was between 1 and 10 days old . \nYou provide a simple explanation of the figure , clarify that it is n't written in ` tables of stone ' , and that it needs to be regarded as indicative only . \nEven if someone says their flu started last Monday , when it really started last Tuesday , it does n't matter as you work on the basis that such errors will either cancel out or have a fairly consistent effect on the figure . \nSo you might then end up with a figure for Scotland of say 0.01 % , one for England of whatever , etc. . \nWhoops - that should have been ` estimated current infection rate ' . \nUnfortunately it 's not quite that simple . \nNew cases reported on a particular day are really the cases that were confirmed in lab tests from the day -LRB- or night ? -RRB- \nThe swabs for the tests would have been taken from patients presented to a doctor or nurse -LRB- for testing -RRB- at some point from say 12 hours prior to up to 48 hours , possibly more , before . \nHow long depends on how fast the labs work , how long it takes for samples to reach them and be performed . \nAlso , suspected cases will have been swabbed at different points in their infection . \nThe cases that the postitive tests refer to could have started their infections anything from the day before to up to 7 days previously -LRB- assuming it took them 5 days to be tested and 3 days for test to run and processed -RRB- , possibly longer ago . \nThere is also natural variation in how long incubation and infectious periods last in different people , even for a short lived infections like flu ; the upper and lower limits of these periods are still uncertain for the new H1N1 flu strain . \nSo to calculate when confirmed cases first became ill accurately you need to know several processes with high precision , and mostly these are unknown currently . \nFrustrating , but that 's the trouble with asking good , tricky to answer questions ! \nOf course , one could always ask the cases themselves when they first got symptoms , which I 'm sure has been done by the HPA and other . \nAt 11:11 am on 17 Jun 2009 , worriedofessex wrote : I have just found out I am pregnant - about 4 weeks . \nI have two children already . \nI always thought I 'd be pleased to have a third child , but I found out on the same day that the pregnant woman in Scotland died . \nNow I am very worried about the pregnancy and how I have placed myself in a very vulnerable position . \nI am even giving serious consideration to ending the pregnancy before it gets any more advanced . \nI 'd be pregnant right through the winter , when a surge in cases of swine flu is predicted . \nI just do n't know what to do . \nI also have mild asthma which is an added worry . \nIt shows there 's not much in it , perhaps . \nAt 2:48 pm on 17 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Worriedofessex , try not to worry , I know that sounds trite but it is not . \nThere are over 60 million people in this country and very few have complications of flu . \nI am sure you will not have problems . \nKeep yourself fit and well , eat sensibly , do n't overwork and over-stress yourself , get a sensible night sleep and stay away from too many parties and nights on the tiles . \nYou see , you probably do all of the right things anyway . \nPlan your next few months carefully and accept help where it is offered . \nAccept this humble bit of advice from a grannie who also worries about her grandchildren and family . \nAt 7:00 pm on 17 Jun 2009 , worriedofessex wrote : Thank you sensibleoldgrannie for your reassurance . \nIt is very easy to hear the news everyday and read everything on the internet and become very hyped-up over it all . \nI am seeing my GP tomorrow to talk things over with him . \nHi , I am also very worried about the current outbreak of swine flu ! \nOne minute it 's ok the next minute you have to be worried for one reason or another and never quite know what to believe . \nAs a pregnant woman who also suffers from mild asthma which is controlled by inhalers i also find it worrying . \nI feel there is not enough information or readily available support for us even though we are in the ' at risk group ' As i am in my third trimester i am finding all of this stressful along with the worry that my daughter who attends primary school and my partner who constantly works with alot of members of the public ! \nSensibleoldgrannie though with all due respect has actually given some refreshing and positive information and i agree with her we have to get on with our lives ... but it is hard when one thge other hand we are advised to ' try our hardest not to catch swine flu ' worriedofessex although we are apparently more at risk think how many other pregnant women are in this world at the moment , not all will get it and if they do although they do have slighlty weaker immune systems we are still very much able to fight infection and the majority will be just fine ! \nIt is absolutely terriblew what has happened to the scottish lady and her baby but unfortunately she was just extremely unlucky and we do n't know what her underlying health conditions are . . \nDo exactly as sensibleoldgrannie has said . . \nlook after yourself and if you feel at all unwell get in touch with your GP asap . \nPlease do n't put your life on standstill and think about that beautiful life inside of you . . \nTaake precautions and be sensible and i am sure you will be just fine XXX At 09:49 am on 19 Jun 2009 , 27weeks wrote : And also when the WHO mentioned on their website ' a disproportinately high number of cases involving pregnant women ' Does that mean out of the number of people worldwide that have contracted the illness and recovered or the amount of pregnant women who have became actual victims and died ?? At 10:21 pm on 19 Jun 2009 , returnofmotherjones wrote : Is n't the ` disproportionately high number of cases involving pregnant women ' likely to be because pregnant women , if unwell , are more likely to take the precaution of visiting their doctors , while if they were n't pregnant they would simply ride it out ? \nNo idea ?? That is just a comment made by Margaret Chan on the WHO website . . \nAnd being pregnant myself i find it quite frustrating that they do n't ellaborate on what they are saying . . \nCould it be that out of the people who have suffered\\/recovered already from the virus that a large number of them were pregnant and that 's where the info regarding ' disproportionately high number of cases involve pregnant women ' or are they in actual fact talking about the number of deaths . . \nit 's very worrying we do n't have alot to go by really - only our own instincts but is that enough ???

Tea Party 's Role in Republican Politics Welcome , Says Gallup ; Quality Versus Quantity of Jobs Created Aired January 31 , 2011 - 10:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nKYRA PHILLIPS , CNN ANCHOR : OK . \nIt 's the top of the hour , and it 's Monday , 10:00 a.m. in the east , 14 minutes to sunrise in San Francisco , right now we 're watching the midwest in that dangerous winter storm that could bury old snow records in St. Louis and Chicago . \nThe system could trigger tornadoes in the south and it could batter the east cost by Thursday . \nThen near Seattle , a vigil for a corrections officer found dead in a prison chapel . \nIt 's believed that an inmate serving life for rape and assault strangled her as she was trying to escape . \nThe victim , Jamie Vindal was the only guard working in the chapel . \nThe superintendent said she did n't even carry a weapon , the inmate is now in an isolated unit and has asked for a lawyer . \nAnd the government 's new dietary guidelines out today , if you love sugar , salt and big sticks of margarine , you 're out of luck , the fed say cut that out . \nEat more seafood , fruits and veggies . \nIt 's now 5:00 p.m. in Egypt and a curfew is in place and Hosni Mubarak remains in power . \nThis morning he swore in a new cabinet in his latest concession to anti-government protesters . \n \n \nMOHAMED ELBARADEI , NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE -LRB- via phone -RRB- : I will continue to participate in whatever it takes to make sure that the Mubarak regime should leave . \nI think that 's a terrifying - that is a consensus here in

and that is democratic , and we 're watching the midwest in San Francisco , right now we \nMOHAMED ELBARADEI , NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE -LRB- via phone -RRB- : I will continue to participate in whatever

failed to deliver on economic , social or political fronts , and that we need a new beginning in Egypt that is free and that is democratic , and we need to go through a transitional period . \nPHILLIPS : But on the seventh day of protests , some stark realities hitting home . \nFood shortages becoming commonplace . \nPeople waiting in lines for hours to buy bread . \nStore shelves becoming empty . \nLawlessness reaching a new level as well . \nPrisons empty with murderers , rapists , terrorists running free . \nAnd a show of brazen defiance , citizens then looted those prisons themselves . \nNow all eyes remain on the country 's military on what role it 's going to play in the uprising . \nFighters igniting fear and rumors yesterday when they buzz crowds of protesters and some people felt panicked because they thought they were about to be bombed . \nNow out of the chaos , Mohammed Elbaradei is emerging as a leading figure of the opposition . \nThe name might sound familiar . \nHe used to head up the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency . \nAnd yesterday , he joined the crowds in Cairo 's -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Square . \nA move that energized many of those protesters . \nOur Fred Pleitgen was right there earlier this morning . \nAnd he told us what he saw at street level . \nFREDERICK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Police forces absolutely vanished off the street here . \nThere is some talk that it might return today . \nWe 're not exactly sure that 's going to be the case but simply that 's something that is really being discussed and is the talk of the town . \nThat could actually spur new unrest , because it was the heavy-handedness of the police that caused the riot here last Friday . \nBut right now , there 's no police present . \nI was going around Cairo yesterday , in the suburbs , and we went past seven or eight police stations , which all of them had been abandoned , looted and burned down . \nThere is an air of lawlessness where a lot of people are defending their own homes with everything they can find from samurai swords to clubs to rifle . \nSo right now there is n't much in the way of any law enforcement authority . \nAnd the ones that are sort of trying to keep order is the military . \nPHILLIPS : Well , the U.S. is evacuating Americans who want to escape that turmoil in Egypt . \nAnd U.S. citizens are gathering now in Cairo 's main airport . \nThe first charter flight has already taken off . \nThe evacuees will be responsible for the costs of their flights , and according to the State Department , there are about 52,000 Americans registered with the embassy in Cairo . \nSo far , 2,400 Americans have already been asked to evacuate . \nNow , for those who want to stay , the State Department is urging them to limit their movements , and keep a close eye on this escalating crisis . \nNow Lara Getz is one of 35 students who got caught up in the Egypt unrest . \nShe and her Tulane classmates have been waiting for the call that says they can go home . \nLaura joins me on the phone from Alexandria , Egypt . \nSo Lara , describe what you 've seen and what it 's been like for you ? \nLARA GETZ , STRANDED STUDENT : Well , first of all , I should probably clarify that I 'm just one student from Tulane . \nWe 're a group of about 20 different students from different programs here , but it 's been a really , you know , extraordinary and pretty life-changing experience . \nYou know , right know , we 're waiting to get out , but you know , starting on Friday we were able to see the Egyptian people finally stand up to a government that 's been extremely oppressive for about 30 years now and you know , take to the streets in a unified effort , despite the president 's efforts in limiting that . \nI mean , he cut off the internet . \nHe cut off all mobile services , so there 's no communication among people and yet everyone 's still banded together . \nIt has , you know , been a mixture of experiences . \nIt has been frightening at times , since it 's been getting violent between people looting and you know , some of the criminals getting out . \nSo , you know people running around . \nPeople have weapons now , but what has been really extraordinary as well has been to see how the Egyptian people have really united over all of this , and that , you know , in the neighborhoods we have been seeing people - we know people who are pretty much setting up watches and guards , and having people from all different walks of life , professors , street shop owners , young people , to like an 80-year-old man coming down and guarding their buildings and their friends and families and neighborhoods . \nSo , you know , on the one hand you see , yes , it 's become violent and it 's unfortunately come to this state , and the president has refused to step down . \nOn the other hand , you 've also seen a people really unite and show that they can really work together . \nPHILLIPS : Lara , you 've been mixing with college students since you 've been there , with other college students and you know , the average age is 20-something , 30-something , the younger generation that 's out there in protest . \nWhat have fellow college students there been telling you , as you talk about , even before this , as you talk about the politics and the life ? \nI mean , for the most part , have they all appeared to be anti- Mubarak ? \nOr have you found that there are students in support of his government ? \nGETZ : Obviously - this program has had a unique opportunity to really get to know the Egyptian youth themselves . \nAll of us have a lot of Egyptian friends . \nAnd so obviously , you know , we 've seen a wide range of people , but really the majority of them know that it 's type for Mubarak to step down . \nHe 's been extremely oppressive . \nThey all want something better . \nThey all want a better life for their family , for their friends , for their country . \nAnd so , you know , it has been incredible . \nThings that quite honestly , as a lot of people led up to the 25th and to Friday , you know - I 'm not sure how many people are expecting this to actually happen among the Egyptians and American students that I know . \nPHILLIPS : Real quickly , do you know how you 're going to get out of there , Lara ? \nDo you have any idea ? \nGETZ : We do . \nRight now , we have a couple different plans and we 're just waiting to see which one is the best option . \nOne of the problems has been that most of the evacuation efforts , actually almost all evacuation efforts have been focused on Cairo , and we 're in Alexandria . \nSo we 've been pretty much working with different people in the U.S. and in Egypt to help get evacuation efforts from Alexandria , which is now beginning to work . \nPHILLIPS : Well , you keep us posted , Lara . \nWe want to stay in touch with you . \nThank you so much for calling in . \nLet 's take a quick check of the big board right now . \nIt looks like the Dow Industrials up 10 points . \nOverseas markets are shaky , of course , because of the turmoil in the Middle East . \nWe 'll keep watching the numbers for you and what it means for you . \nNow the instability is not just hanging over Wall Street , it 's also rippling to your corner gas station . \nSome analysts say that if Egypt remains in turmoil we could see oil prices more than double . \nStephanie Elam , that is not going to make commuters happy . \nSTEPHANIE ELAM , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : No , it 's not exactly the Valentine 's day present anyone is hoping for around here , Kyra . \nThis is what everyone is keeping their eyes on , is exactly how far this unrest is going to go . \nCould it potentially affect the Suez Canal because it affect the Su-Med pipeline ? \nThis is really important . \nBecause they actually are in Egypt 's control . \nHowever , a lot of the world 's oil makes their way through this . \nSo here you have on this one graphic here that the red line , which would be the Suez Canal and then yellow line , which is the Sumed pipeline . \nWe should not that that pipeline has 1.8 million barrels a day that flowed through it . \nIn 2009 , at 1.8 million flowed through the Suez Canal . \nSo those two arteries are key to getting oil out . \nBecause if those two did n't exist , Kyra , then they would have to ship it all the way around Africa , and that 's an extra 6,000 miles . \nSo no one wants to do that , because obviously it 's more expensive , and on top of it . \nIt would really cut into supply here if we had to do that . \nSo that would just take a lot longer to do and would affect how this oil gets to everybody else . \nBecause as we know , a lot of the Middle East producers supply to a lot of the world . \nNow , at this point I do need to say that there could be delays at the Suez Canal . \nThere maybe some delays now but it 's not because of issues as far as the canal is concerned . \nWhat we are hearing is that the issues are communications because we know a lot of the communications abilities were shut down because of the unrest . \nSo shippers are having a hard time . \nThe cal itself , the pipeline itself , are very much in control . \nSo right now , we 're seeing that displayed even in oil prices , which did top 90 bucks in overnight trading but have come back a little bit . \nSo it does n't look like anything crazy right now , but again that could change on a dime when you see what exactly has gone on with oil just this month , Kyra . \nPHILLIPS : All right , we 're going to keep tracking it . \nThat major blizzard that we 've been talking about with possible record-setting cold and snow , is moving into the midwest . \nRob Marciano is watching it second by second for us . \nROB MARCIANO , AMS METEOROLOGIST : Yes , it 's really starting to come together . \nWe have a number of ingredients and it 's going to be multi-day event , Kyra and it 's going to be a multistate event and it 's going to be multi-headaches . \nI can tell you that . \nWe 've got snow , cold air , so frigid cold temperatures , blizzard conditions expected in Chicago , a ribbon of ice from New York City all the way back through northern Texas . \nAnd then down to the south , thankfully no snow or ice in the deep south , but enough heat and energy that we built up over the weekend to probably spawn some severe thunderstorms tomorrow and again on Wednesday . \nSo big storm and big headaches . \nWe got winter storm watches that have been posted from New England all the way down to New Mexico . \nSo over 2,000 miles of linear real estate there , and tens of millions of people affected by this thing . \nAnd we could see anywhere from places like Chicago , you could see 12 to 18 inches of snow . \nIf that happens , and I 'm pretty confident we 're going to have at least a foot . \nIf they get 18 inches or 20 inches that would be the biggest snowstorm that they have seen in over 10 years . \nSo a big deal , no doubt about it . \nWe got a bit of rain across parts of the southeast . \nThis is causing some travel delays across Atlanta , just kind of a precursor of the main storm . \nMinneapolis also seeing some snow right now . \nThat 's driving down into Chicago , but this is the main event here , or the main piece of energy that 's really going to be driving down into Texas . \nAnd as that happens , everything is going to begin to take shape with this system . \nAnd we 're going to start to see it wind up fairly rapidly . \nI mentioned Atlanta got some delays , Houston , some delays as well , and Minneapolis because of the snow that 's limiting visibility right now , a couple of inches on the ground from this particular storm . \nLet 's go through where this storm is going to be and what time . \nWe start it today , and we go through the next 24 hours . \nOklahoma through parts of eastern Kansas is going to get hammered with snow and wind tomorrow . \nBlizzard conditions expected in Chicago , again a foot and a half potentially and the wintry mix nosing into the northeast , several inches of snow and ice expected there through Thursday . \nGoing to be quite a week . \nHold on to your hats . \nPHILLIPS : All right . \nYou 've heard of krab , with a `` k , '' right ? \nIs it really crab ? \nIt never had claws or legs . \nWe want to know , what other foods are out there that sounds genuine ? \nYou might even fool your taste buds , if you really think about it . \nPHILLIPS : Well , the stars came out for the Screen Actors Guild last night . \nAnd the `` King 's Speech , '' `` The Fighter '' and `` Boardwalk Empire '' are some of the big winners . \n`` Showbiz Tonight '' host A.J. Hammer is watching all these for us . \nIt 's good to see you back . \nI missed you last week . \nDid you see `` The King 's Speech '' ? \nA.J. HAMMER , HOST `` SHOWBIZ TONIGHT '' : You know what , I still have n't seen it ? \nI ca n't believe I 'm saying that . \nI have a whole pile of movies to get to before the Oscars . \nPHILLIPS : A.J. , you 've got to see this movie . \nHAMMER : I 'm on it . \nWell , last night , Kyra , I 'm here to tell you `` The King 's Speech '' absolutely ruled and it was Betty White who reigned last night at the Screen Actor 's guild in Los Angeles . \nNow `` The King 's Speech '' won two awards , including the big one , outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture . \nColin Firth got outstanding male actor for playing King George VI in a movie , `` Black Swan 's '' Natalie Portman and `` The Fighter '' co-stars Christian Bale and Melissa Leo were also honored with 12 pound , 16 - inch high trophies called `` The Actor . '' \nOver the TV side , `` Boardwalk Empire '' and `` Modern Family '' won the awards for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama and comedy , respectively . \nHAMMER : Well , 89-year-old Betty White beat out `` Glee 's '' Jane Lynch and `` 30 Rock 's '' Tina Fey for favorite TV funny woman in a comedy series for her role in `` Hot in Cleveland . '' \nDo you see the look in her face ? \nShe looked absolutely shocked , and no surprise , Betty brought down the house . \nBETTY WHITE , ACTRESS : But to have this happen on top of -- oww ! \n-- on top of everything else , I can not say thank you enough . \nHAMMER : Now , this was White 's first S.A.G. award , Kyra . \nShe called the win the biggest surprise of her career when you think about how many decades , multiple decades , Betty White has had a career , that 's a pretty big statement . \nPHILLIPS : She 's a piece of work . \nCan you believe she 's 89 years old ? \nPHILLIPS : Yes and she 's still got it . \nSo clearly it was a night of big stars , and big winners , but one huge TV star was noticeably absent . \nHAMMER : Yes , the guy with the biggest show on TV as far as sitcoms are concerned . \nWe 're talking about Charlie Sheen , of course . \nAnd that 's because he checked himself into rehab once again on Friday . \nThat 's basically shut down production of his hit sitcom `` Two and a Half Men , '' for the second time in a year . \nHis publicist telling `` Showbiz Tonight '' Charlie voluntarily entered an undisclosed rehabilitation center , and CBS and Warner Brothers Television tell us , `` We are profoundly concerned for his health and well being and support his decision . '' \nNow the announcement that he 's seeking treatment came a day after Charlie was hospitalized with what his publicist had called severe abdominal pains late last week . \nAn ambulance was called to Sheen 's Beverly Hills home , that was early Thursday , amid all these reports of wild party with porn stars , Charlie will reportedly be in rehab for at least , the next three months . \nAnd that leaves the production status of `` Two and a Half Men '' in limbo for the time being . \nBut while Charlie is headed into rehab , some pretty good news about celebrities who have finished up their time in treatment . \nDisney star Demi Lovato left the treatment center that she voluntarily entered three months ago . \nShe has returned to her home in Los Angeles , according to a source close to her family . \nLovato dropped out of a world tour with the Jonas Brothers and sought help for emotional and physical issues back in early November . \nThat was after some kind of an altercation with a dancer on her concert tour . \nLittle information has been made public about Demi 's issues , but a statement by her publicist in November described them as emotional and physical issues that she 's dealt with for some time . \nAnd the publicist had cautioned at that time against describing the treatment as rehab . \nSo good to see her out , hopefully on the right path , Kyra . \nPHILLIPS : All right . \nAnd if you want information on everything breaking in the entertainment world , A.J. has always got it for you . \nEvery night , `` Showbiz Tonight '' 5:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on HLN . \nWell , beefy , cheesy , chocolatey , how do you know if you 're eating the real thing ? \nThe beef with Taco Bell 's beef had us talking this morning . \nAnd of course we 're keeping an eye on Egypt . \nThe situation there so volatile right now . \nCNN correspondents are all over the region witnessing the action right there on the ground and from the air . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : This is an unmistakable show of military force . \nFighter jets flying low over Cairo 's Tahrir -LRB- ph -RRB- Square , Liberation Square . \nThis has been as symbol of defiance . \nPHILLIPS : Well , it 's one big step . \nA couple of long-distance runners will never forget taking . \nTheir story tops our look cross country . \nMolly Johnston and David Upton not only ran the 26 miles of Houston 's Chevron marathon yesterday , but they took a matrimonial side trip . \nThey actually tied the knot during the race . \nAs they crossed the finish line , another journey was just starting . \nDAVID UPTON : -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- the only way I was going to marry here -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nMOLLY UPTON , MARATHON NEWLYWEDS : It 's been five years . \nPHILLIPS : We got another love story with good fortune . \nThis one for a homeless couple from Green Bay , Wisconsin . \n-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- and her boyfriend won an all-expense paid trip to this Sunday 's showdown in Dallas , compliments of the city 's visitors and convention bureau which held a secret phrase contest that Ouida read about on-line . \nOUIDA WRIGHT , WON TRIP TO SUPER BOWL : And I said , have you to Dallas lately ? \nAnd he said , oh yes , I have . \nAnd I said `` Are you the contest guy ? '' \nYes , I am . '' \nCan you imagine a homeless person who ca n't afford a movie gets to go to the Super Bowl ? \nPHILLIPS : Well , a lot of people are asking why do n't they just sell that trip , bank the proceeds and look to their future , but it 's Green Bay , Wisconsin , and they 're Packer fans . \nThat 's all I have to say . \nMotorists in downtown Indianapolis need to be careful around the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue in New Jersey street after five manhole covers literally flipped their lids . \nFirefighters investigating a report , a smell of natural gas from those manhole started popping . \nOne fire truck and nearby building were damage . \nLocal gas company says , `` no. -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- manholes do n't appear to be natural gas related . \nWe want to talk more about that beef with Taco Bell . \nThe company has got its call of - well in a big chalupah . \nSorry , I missed that one . \nThe plaintiffs claim that the company 's beef is really less than 35 percent real - the other 65 percent , well , a mix of water , chili pepper and other stuff , including my personal favorite , yeast extract . \nA top company executive says bring it on , the beef claim is bogus and that the food starts with 100 percent USDA inspected beef and that the finished product is about 88 percent beef . \nNow the rest is the stuff that gives the food a flavor . \nHe 's also promising a counter - suit . \nLet 's bring in Kat Kinsman . \nShe 's the managing editor of CNN 's `` Eatocracy , '' food blog . \nNow Cat did I get that right . \nIt is the chalupahs . \nIs that one of the - I have n't been to Taco Bell in a long time . \nDid I say that right ? \nOh , you 're missing out if you have n't been to Taco Bell for a while . \nI think they 're mostly focusing on the taco meat -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nPHILLIPS : I almost said Chihuahua . \nThat would not have been good . \nI would have gotten in big trouble . \nKAN KINSMAN , EATOCRACY.COM : Not so much . \nPHILLIPS : All right . \nSo regardless of who wins this beef battle there 's a teachable fast-food moment here , right ? \nKINSMAN : There certainly is , and really it comes down to three words - read the label . \nAll the information is out there , easy for you to find , it 's on the web site , two clicks away . \nYou 're nuts if you 're looking to Taco Bell to regulate your health at this point . \nJust empower yourself , like in what you 're eating . \nPHILLIPS : Let 's talk about the beef and the chicken , and how do we know - you say read the label , but come on , a lot of us really do n't do that . \nWhat 's the reality check , if a taco is 89 cents we should know it 's not , you know , a certain kind of beef , if the chicken is at a certain price . \nBecause I mean , you know , we do want the real thing , but there 's a lot of marketing ploys out there . \nKINSMAN : There 's a huge difference between cheap food and inexpensive food . \nAnd it just takes educating yourself a little bit to know the difference . \nIn fact today the USDA was releasing new guidelines on what Americans should be eating . \nAnd that just really comes down to personal responsibility . \nAgain , you look for words that you understand . \nHow much salt is in there , how much actual beef is in there , just - if you do n't understand what a word is , take some time out and look it up . \nIt 's the most important thing you 're going to do for your health , so why not take that little bit of time to do it . \nWords like cheesy and even blueberry are not necessarily regulated by the FDA , so you know , marketers will go with terms like chocolatey , beefy . \nI always do n't trust that `` y '' at the end of something because it means it 's like something but is n't something . \nSo again , just go to the label and look for those words . \nLEMON : Got it . \nLemon flavored , chocolate flavored , made with real - that 's interesting . \nWhen they say made with real , dot dot dot ? \nKINSMAN : Oh , it 's crazy . \nYou see a lot of things , made with real juice . \nThat can mean that whatever juice it is that you 're drinking only has been 10 percent actual fruit juice in it . \nYou know , I do n't know about you , but if I 'm drinking juice , I want to be drinking juice , not just added sugar and water . \nAnd again , those new guidelines that are coming out today are telling you that you really should be cutting down on all of that added sugar , on added salt , and it 's really just up to people to take care of their own well-being . \nIt 's not that hard , and it 's all right out there . \nPHILLIPS : Good advice . \nKat Kinsman , a managing editor of CNN 's Eatocracy . \nIf you have n't seen it in our web site . \nCNN `` Eatocracy , '' go right to it with all kinds of good advise . \nPHILLIPS : Well the situation in Egypt so volatile right now that things can change in an instant . \nWe 've seen it protesters are defying the curfew , thugs are roaming the streets with machetes and home-made weapons and with little to no police force , well , people there are forced to protect their homes and belongings however they can . \nFirsthand account , live from Cairo is next . \nPHILLIPS : Well , stock market opening ball just about an hour ago . \nLet 's check the numbers . \nDow Industrials up 24 points . \nThe uprising in Egypt may be causing ulcers on Wall Street . \nStocks opened higher just about an hour ago , but investors remain cautious about Egypt . \nLet 's go live now to Stephanie Elam in New York . \nSo , Steph , Egypt not a big oil producer , but there are definitely concerns over the disruptions to tanker shipments going through the Suez Canal . . \nWe talked a lot about this with Zain Verjee out of London . \nIt 's definitely something we 're watching . \nSTEPHANIE ELAM , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : Yes , it 's something everyone will be watching , especially on Wall Street because it could impact us . \nRight now , it does look like things are controlled . \nWhen you take a look at the Suez Canal , though , it is so , so important . \nSimply because if it were n't for the Suez Canal and the Sumed Pipeline , which is just to its west , then you would have to ship it all the way around Africa , which would be an extra 6,000 miles you 'd have to add to the shipment . \nSo , the fact that these two arteries are in Egypt has made people watch . \nBut overall , things have looked like they 've been controlled . \nEgypt is saying that everything is controlled at the Suez Canal , that there are no issues . \nShippers may see some delays , but that 's because of communication issues . \nThose are those two arteries , the yellow one and the red . \nThe Suez Canal is the red one . \nThey 're very , very key . \nAs you can see there , 1.1 million barrels coming through the Sumed Pipeline , 1.8 barrels going through the Suez Canal . \nSo , very important . \nBut right now , based on what we 've been seen , oil has gone up over 90 dollars a barrel overnight , but pretty much holding steady there . \nThat 's that trip around Africa that would add that extra 6,000 miles , which no one wants . \nThat would really mess with supply and demand . \nSo , all in all , we are keeping an eye on it . \nIt could change , but right now , it does seem like things are controlled as far as this is concerned in Egypt . \nIf that were to change , then that would be something that could affect the markets again here like we saw happen on Friday , Kyra . \nPHILLIPS : All right . \nAnd let 's switch to another subject , Democrats announcing an aviation bill this afternoon . \nThey say this would mean more jobs . \nWhat 's your take on that ? \nThey 're selling this as completely about the jobs . \nThe Democrats in the Senate say they 'll take to the floor today . \nIt 's really about $ 8 billion that they 're saying would actually help out with the airports , get this money to the FAA so that they can improve the infrastructure of airports , and golly , do n't we know some airports that could use some of that fundage . \nBut they 're pointing to an American Association of Airport Executives estimate , which says that these construction funds would play the part in 280,000 jobs . \nNow , they 're saying it would n't create the jobs necessarily . \nSome of these jobs could already exist , but they 're saying it would help keep some of these jobs around . \nA lot of construction jobs here as well . \nThey 're saying the airline industry accounts for about 11 million U.S. jobs , they would like to see more of that happening . \nNow , if this bill sounds familiar , it was taken to the Senate floor last spring , and it did pass 93-0 was the vote there , but then later stalled because of some side issues involved . \nThe Senate Democrats are now saying this could get through more easily this go - around , but they 're really pushing it in this $ 8 million really as they 're fixing up the infrastructure they will actually be able to create jobs and keep some jobs basically . \nThey 're very careful how they want to word that , but hoping this will help out some of the cities across the nation . \nIt 's about 10:30 now in the East , 7:30 out West . \nHistory-making winter storm about to hammer the Midwest . \nIt could impact 100 million people before it 's all over . \nChicago , St. Louis could see new snow records . \nAnd that storm could spin off tornadoes in the South . \nThe East Coast could see it by Thursday . \nAnd ready to roll . \nA little more than nine hours from now , workers at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida will begin moving the space shuttle Discovery to the launching pad . \nThe February 24 liftoff will be Discovery 's last . \nDiscovery crew will deliver a module and spare parts to the International Space Station . \nWell , you have seen the images . \nThe protesters , their faces , but who are they ? \nWell , they are young , the median age in Egypt is 24 . \nAnd many are highly educated with advanced degrees . \nDespite that , they are unemployed or underemployed . \nAccording to the U.N. , Egypt 's per capita income is $ 1,800 a year . \nThe official unemployment rate last year was 9.7 percent , but experts say the real jobless rate is significantly higher . \nAll of those factors created a volatile situation , one that my next guest is watching very closer . \nDina Amer lives in Cairo . \nShe grew up there , and it 's her generation that has flooded the streets of Cairo . \nShe 's a freelance journalist working with CNN this week . \nAnd Dina , just to tell our viewers , you actually interned for us a number of months ago . \nYou did an incredible job , you graduated college , one of the smartest we have ever seen . \nAnd you were back home , visiting your parents in Cairo where you grew up . \nYou were in London working , and it 's amazing how this all happened in just a couple days . \nBut for you as an up-and - coming journalist , this is giving you real-life experience . \nWhen has it been like for you and your family ? \nDINA AMER , FREELANCE JOURNALIST -LRB- via telephone -RRB- : Hello , Kyra . \nThank you very much , first , for saying all those lovely things about me . \nIt was a pleasure to work with you . \nBut I mean , this has been surreal . \nI mean , I would n't think in my wildest dreams I would be present here in Cairo while all this was happening . \nAnd I would be able , as a journalist , to take upon myself to experience this not only professionally , but personally , because my family is here , and I am also very emotionally affected . \nThere are many events unfolding around me , and it 's all very surreal in that aspect . \nI think that the most important -- PHILLPS : What 's -- what 's it like at home , Dina ? \nI think you mentioned that your brother has been outside sort of guarding the homestead , kind of being your security guard . \nDescribe to me how your family and you have responded to this , because it 's something that you guys have lived there for years that you 've never experienced . \nAs you can tell , basic government functions have completely , like , failed , so citizens have taken it upon themselves . \nSo , my brother and every man in the neighborhood has been up every night without a wink of sleep standing in the streets , with either kitchen knives or , like , wooden sticks , baseball bats , creating their own militias to try to secure the neighborhoods and to take care of their loved ones up above . \nIt 's just - it 's very surreal because this is a very safe place normally . \nWe never have to worry about , you know , taking care of our own property or looters , any of this . \nBut because the reports of looting and vandalism and breaking into homes , every citizen has been on edge , and they have really been out in the streets every night , all the men grouped together and unified to secure the neighborhood . \nPHILLIPS : What about food ? \nWe 've been reporting about a shortage of food , and you ca n't get out to get any food . \nHave you experienced that ? \nAMER : Yes , I have . \nMy mother actually called me today very frantically . \nShe went to the supermarket there were a lot of shortages of food . \nPeople were there and they were really stocking up on all types of food products and supplies for the home . \nBecause people are very much on edge . \nWe do n't know what 's going to happens next . \nAnd if it continues and prolonged , then what will happen if there is a serious shortage of food ? \nPHILLIPS : Now , Dina , this is your age group , it 's the younger generation that are out there on the streets protesting . \nAre you surprised by this ? \nDid you sort of see this coming ? \nDo you have classmates that are out there , people that you have grown up with out on the streets ? \nAMER : I mean , this is very surprising . \nI 'm American-Egyptian , I used to come back every summer , every winter break . \nAnd I never in my -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- would have imagined this type of uprising to the Mubarak regime . \nBut it 's happening , and people are in the streets , very impassioned and relentlessly coming back every day . \nThe youth -- most of the youth are there because also , as you mentioned , there 's high unemployment . \nSo , this is kind of a sense of purpose every day to go out there and continue until they see their demands come to fruition . \nPHILLIPS : Dina Amer there , working for us in the Cairo bureau . \nSure appreciate you calling in . \nIt 's great to have your experience and your background as an Egyptian there working for us . \nDina , thank you . \nPHILLIPS : Well , eat less salt ? \nThat 's just one recommendation in the government 's new dietary guidelines . \nWe 're going to tell you what else is on the list for better health . \nPHILLIPS : The very latest on the situation in E -- Egypt , rather , in just a moment . \nBut first , we want to catch you up on a few international stories worth your attention today in the `` Morning Passport . '' \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton back from a quick visit this weekend to Haiti . \nThis is in advance of the nation 's presidential runoff . \nThat 's coming up in March . \nNow , Secretary Clinton says she 's still got concern about the Haiti 's election protocols , but is n't considering to withhold crucial U.S. aid to Haiti . \nAnd to Cambodia , where published reports have surviving members . \nThe Khmer Rouge asking for their release from jail in advance of their war crimes trial set for next year . \nNow , the brutal regime is blamed for killing thousands of people , if not millions during the bloody rule in the late 1970s . \nTheir leader was found guilty back in July of last year . \nAnd Japan 's Mount Shimo . \nCool to look at , but bad to live close by . \nThe long-quiet volcano roared to life for the first time in 50 years , belching hot , molten ash to the townspeople below . \nFolks closest to the eruption have been safely evacuated . \nAnd just moments ago , the government released a new list of dietary guidelines , urging Americans to eat healthy foods . \nAmong the recommendations , cut down on salt . \nHigh-risk groups , no more than half a teaspoon a day . \nEverybody else , one teaspoon . \nPut more vegetables and fruits in your diet . \nReplace those refined grains with whole grains . \nAnd limit cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams per day . \nThe goal behind the new guidelines , promoting health , reducing the risk of chronic diseases , and fighting weight problems . \nPresident Obama 's push to create jobs is running smack into a hard truth . \nMost of the new jobs just are n't paying enough . \nNIC ROBERTSON , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : The gunfire we can hear rocketing through the air , demonstrators say that 's the army firing to warn them to stay away . \nIt 's long - there 's gunshots - it 's long after curfew right now . \nAnd if the government was controlling the situation -- tracer fire flying into the air -- these people would n't be out on the streets if the government was in control . \nPHILLIPS : Last night -- earlier -- I spoke with Nic , and he says that today , the Egyptian army is using even more muscle . \nThey 're firing warning shots at protesters . \nPHILLIPS : An overwhelming majority of Republicans want the Tea Party to have some role in their party . \nSenior political editor Mark Preston following that story for us from the CNNpolitics desk . \nMARK PRESTON , CNN SENIOR POLITICAL EDITOR : Hey , good morning , Kyra . \nGreat news for Tea Party activists . \nA new Gallup poll just released a few hours ago shows that 90 percent of Republicans say that it 's important that the Tea Party 's ideas are given significant weight within the party as it 's going forward . \nNow , we really should n't be too surprised by this because the fact of the matter is , the Tea Party 's main platforms are really based on fiscal discipline and really cost cutting here in Washington , D.C. And given these tough , fiscal times , a lot of folks would like to see that happen . \nYou know , yesterday , the new White House chief of staff , Bill Daly was out on the talk show circuit . \nIn fact , he was on CBS ' `` Face The Nation . '' \nHe was asked about health care and moving forward the whole issue . \nWell , you know President Obama just last week in the State of the Union address said he would be open to working with Republicans to make some changes to that , although President Obama really defended the health care legislation that he really pushed through Congress last year . \nWell , the White House chief of staff reiterated that yesterday . \nHe said the president has said that he 's been open to changes , but he did go on to say that the president is not in favor of refighting this fight . \nWell , we know House representatives - the House Republicans pushed through the repeal of health care recently , so I suspect this will be an issue that Democrats and Republicans will continue to fight about . \nPHILLIPS : President Obama does n't just have to deal with the job loss , but also the kind of jobs being created . \nTell us about that . \nPRESTON : Yes , this is really a fascinating story that 's up on CNNmoney.com , written by Chris Isadora . \nThe fact of the matter is , there 's been a lot of talk about how many jobs have been lost . \nThe Obama administration Democrats are talking about jobs they have created since the recession . \nThe fact of the matter is , what kinds of jobs have they created ?

{"txt": "( CNN ) -- When I asked John Williamson about the death of the Washington Consensus , the British-based economist responded with a simple question . \nHis full answer was `` No , I 've not voted for him . \nI 've always voted for the other party -- the Liberal Democrats . '' \nA Conversation With John Williamson , Economist Poor countries have decried it . \nAnti-globalization protesters have rallied against it . \nAnd at the G20 summit in London , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown declared it dead . \nBut is the `` Washington Consensus '' really gone ? \nNot if you ask John Williamson , the soft-spoken British economist who coined the term 20 years ago -- and has been under fire ever since . \nHow did a wonky paper outlining 10 recommendations on fiscal discipline and open markets become such a lightning rod ? \nWilliamson , a senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics , spoke last week with Outlook 's Carlos Lozada about what caused the financial crisis and how , whatever Brown says , the Washington Consensus is alive and well -- just check out the G20 communique . \nExcerpts : Where were you when Gordon Brown declared that your `` old Washington Consensus is over '' ? \nDid you watch it on TV ? \nI was in the Galapagos . \nI did not watch it on TV ; I did have Internet access in the Galapagos so I was able to read about it . \nPeople have been saying the Washington Consensus is dead for about twenty years now , ever since it was first created . \nMy reaction was more amusement than anger , but it was a combination of the two . \nIt depends on what one means by the Washington Consensus . \nIf one means the ten points that I tried to outline , then clearly it 's not right . \nIf one uses the interpretation that a number of people -- including Joe Stiglitz , most prominently -- have foisted on it , that it is a neoliberal tract , then I think it is right . \nHow would you summarize it ? \n-LRB- It -RRB- involved macroeconomic discipline , including fiscal discipline , which was a particular problem in Latin America . \nAnd then it involved using the market economy , not setting it up on a totem pole as some ideal that must never be interfered with , but recognizing that there were serious limitations on the market economy . \nAnd third was globalization , free trade , absorbing oneself into the global economy . \nIs the Washington Consensus in any way to blame for the global financial crisis ? \nI think that would be pushing it . \nIf you read the communique following the London summit , you 'll find that three of the things they agreed on were very much the things I have used to summarize the Washington Consensus . \nIt starts off with globalization , it also mentions the market economy . \nFiscal discipline comes later ; it 's in paragraphs 10 and 11 rather than right at the beginning , because that 's not the immediate problem . \nIf the Washington Consensus is n't to blame , what is ?

{"txt": "09 February 12 16:07 GMT Associate Fellow , Royal United Services Institute Pressure is building on the Syrian army with a deepening armed uprising and growing defections . \nShashank Joshi of the Royal United Services Institute considers how the military , the foundation of Bashar al-Assad 's rule , is coping . \nMr Assad 's military has been turned into a ruthless confessional militia that will see little future in a post-Assad Syria . \n`` The army will collapse during February -LRB- Reuters -RRB- In 1982 , the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ordered his forces to crush a rebellion against his rule , '' Bashar al-Assad wrote in his book , `` Libya : From Libya to Damascus . ' . \nThe eastern part of his army melted away immediately , and over eight months the rest progressively disintegrated to leave a rump of loyal , family-led units . \nThirty years ago to this month , President Hafez al-Assad of Syria ordered his elite forces to level the city of Hama in response to a surging Islamist rebellion . \nOnly one brigade defected . \nThomas Friedman - in his book From Beirut to Jerusalem - called this decisive brutality `` Hama rules '' . \nHafez 's successor and son , President Bashar al-Assad , is operating under `` Homs rules '' - neither those of Libya last year , nor Hama a generation ago . \nMr Assad 's security forces have been predictably resilient . \nA regime built around the Alawite sect has stacked its officer corps with co-religionists , fellow tribesmen , and family members . \nThe 4th Mechanised Division , which recently scrambled to regain control of Damascus ' suburbs , is drawn entirely from that sect . \nSo too is the Republican Guard and influential air force intelligence . \nThe Shabiha , an Alawite militia , has also been a useful auxiliary . \nIn short , Syria 's military has been turned into a ruthless confessional militia that is likely to see little future in a post-Assad Syria . \nAt the same time , no army can withstand stresses of this intensity and duration without suffering problems of morale , integrity and loyalty . \nThe country 's demography means that only Sunni conscripts can fill up the rank-and-file . \nAlthough the regime has sought to limit their role in combat , a steady trickle of defections has been unavoidable . \nThe military opposition 's commander Col Riad al-Assad , based in southern Turkey , claims to command 40,000 soldiers in his Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- . \nGen Mustafa al-Sheikh , the highest-ranking defector so far , has estimated the regime 's combat readiness as having fallen to `` 40 % for hardware and 32 % for personnel '' . \nHe argues that there is a grave shortage of manpower , that Sunni officers have fled or been removed , and that large parts of the army are secretly reaching out the FSA to defect . \nGen Sheikh , who has formed his own Higher Revolutionary Council to supersede the FSA , boldly predicts that `` the army will collapse during February '' . \nThat timeline is highly improbable . \nIt is as much an effort to garner international support and induce further defections , as it is an objective assessment of regime capabilities . \nEven if defections are as numerous as the opposition claims , that would still leave the ratio of government-to-rebel forces as more than four-to-one - a margin of superiority exceeding that seen in Libya , supplemented by militias , and with airpower held largely in reserve . \nAt the same time , President Assad 's force long ago passed the point at which they could hope for a final , decisive assault like that of Assad senior at Hama in 1982 . \nThe most important factor is the deepening and widening of the uprising over recent months . \nThose once wedded to peaceful protest now judge that taking up arms is the only viable option . \nOne important milestone has been the outbreak of violence this month in Syria 's second city , Aleppo . \nThe army is increasingly stretched across fronts that it did not have to worry about last year . \nIt took days to regain control of suburbs around Damascus , and the town of Zabadani - scarcely 20 miles -LRB- 32km -RRB- north-west of Damascus - was entirely seized by rebels last month . \nThese growing commitments thin out , and increase the strain on , loyal units . \nThe paradox is that more fighting means more defections , but failing to do so risks conceding territory on which the armed parts of the opposition can regroup and consolidate . \nMr Assad 's security forces do retain some advantages . \nLibya taught us that rebel control of territory can be tenuous and easily reversible . \nIndeed , Zabadani is falling back into regime hands . \nMoreover , the external support to Damascus outstrips anything that might be flowing to the FSA from Turkey , Saudi Arabia or Qatar . \nRussia has already sent tons of ammunition , and this lifeline is expected to remain open . \nGen Qassem Suleimani , commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps -LRB- IRGC -RRB- , has reportedly served as `` chief regime adviser and strategist '' . \nThe Guardian reports that he `` has taken up a spot in the war room '' alongside President Assad and his ruling clique . \nThere is also diplomatic succor . \nRegimes can hold together or fall apart based on perceptions . \nRussia 's angry veto of the modest UN resolution last week sent a powerful signal to those Syrian senior officers of wavering loyalty - Moscow is committed to preserving the regime in some form . \nIt is rational for officials and groups hitherto sitting on the fence to adjust their loyalty in line with Russia 's apparent commitment . \nOne hope is that even if President Assad is squeezed out , a Yemen-style stage-managed transition keeps the `` guts '' of the regime in place . \nSome vulnerable minorities who see Assad as guarantor of their safety , have compelling reasons to take a gamble on this outcome . \nA secret US diplomatic cable from Damascus in 2006 observed `` tremendous fear in the Alawite community about retribution if the Sunni majority ever regains power '' . \nAssad 's `` Homs rules '' mean that he has no strategy , only tactics : indiscriminate bombardment of a fragmented opposition , the sharpening of sectarian loyalty to force minority communities to pick sides , and outreach to foreign patrons with a stake in his survival . \nIt is hard to see how this can do anything but accelerate the militarisation of the opposition , induce greater countervailing help to the rebels from frustrated outsiders , and make it very hard for any pluralistic , democratic settlement to emerge from the wreckage .

{"txt": "President Barack Obama has been in a manic rage for more than two years . \nHe lashed out at BP over the monumental oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nHe vowed that he will make BP pay for all the long and short-term damage it caused . \nHe argued that the battle against this now nearly two-month-old raging gusher of oil is tantamount to a war . \nAnd he asked the country to allow him and the Congress to regulate all businesses and private homes in the name of going green . \nFor most Americans , it was the first time they saw him angry -- although a controlled anger from the no-drama-Obama , as his own campaign staff labeled him two years ago . \nBut will the president 's feigned anger get the oil well plugged ? \nWill it get cash into the hands of those truly harmed ? \nWill it prevent future disasters ? \nHere are the facts : After the Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska in 1989 had been cleaned up and nearly paid for by Exxon , the oil companies lobbied the Congress for liability limits -- maximum amounts that they could be held to pay for in the event of a disaster . \nA Republican Congress and President Clinton together made it the law that oil companies would be limited to pay $ 75 million for cleanups and the taxpayers -- that would be you -- would pay the rest . \nIn return , the feds would be able to tell the oil companies where to drill . \nIn the case of BP , it asked the state of Louisiana if it could drill in 500 feet of water and Louisiana said it could . \nThe federal government vetoed that and told BP could only drill in 5,000 feet of water . \nNever mind that no oil company had ever cleaned up a broken well at that depth and never mind that the feds had never monitored a broken well at that depth and never mind that BP only needed to set aside $ 75 million in case something went wrong . \nThe feds trumped BP 's engineers and the feds trumped the wishes of the folks who live along the Gulf Coast and the feds decided where this oil well would be drilled . \nThe feds did nothing . \nOil gushed out in an amount that is so great as to be immeasurable . \nThe president eventually panicked because he believes that his federal government can right every wrong , regulate every activity and protect us from every catastrophe . \nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal was ready to build barriers to protect his state 's coastline and the feds said no. . \nThe president even invoked powers that allow him to supervise the cleanup using BP personnel and equipment . \nAnd the oil still gushes . \nLast week , the president stopped all oil drilling in the Gulf putting thousands out of work . \nLast night he demanded billions from BP so his team could decide who gets it and today a terrified BP gave him all the cash he asked for . \nSo , the government that foolishly limited BP 's maximum liability , the government that claimed it knew where best to drill , the government that actually stopped locals from protecting their own shoreline -- that would be that same government that bankrupted Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , the Post Office , Amtrak and virtually everything it has managed -- now wants to decide who gets BP 's cash . \nThe last time this government had this much private cash to give away , during the GM and Chrysler bankruptcies , it disregarded well-settled law and gave it to the labor unions . \nTo whom will it give this cash -- the innocent injured or its political friends ? \nThe government can not protect us from every catastrophe , especially ones its rules have facilitated . \nHow about this : That government is best which governs least . \nThe people have a right to a government that obeys the laws of economics , the laws of physics and the Constitution . \nLet private enterprise do what it does best and keep politics out of the way . \nIf the Constitution was written to keep the government off the people 's backs , it is time for the feds to get off .

{"txt": "SIRTE , Libya | Thu Oct 20 , 2011 6:31 pm EDT SIRTE , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Disturbing images of a blood-stained and shaken Muammar Gaddafi being dragged around by angry fighters quickly circulated around the world after the Libyan dictator 's dramatic death near his home town of Sirte . \nThe exact circumstances of his demise are still unclear with conflicting accounts of his death . \nBut the footage of the last chaotic moments of Gaddafi 's life offered some clues into what happened . \nGaddafi was still alive when he was captured near Sirte . \nIn the video , filmed by a bystander in the crowd and later aired on television , Gaddafi is shown dazed and wounded being dragged off a vehicle 's bonnet and pulled to the ground by his hair . \n`` Keep him alive , keep him alive ! '' \nGaddafi then goes out of view and gunshots ring out . \n`` They captured him alive and while he was being taken away , they beat him and then they killed him , '' one senior source in the NTC told Reuters . \n`` He might have been resisting . '' \nIn what appeared to contradict the events depicted in the video , Libya 's ruling National Transitional Council said Gaddafi was killed when a gunfight broke out after his capture between his supporters and government fighters . \nThe NTC said Gaddafi 's death was the result of a NATO air strike on a military convoy near Sirte . \nThe NTC said no order had been given to kill him . \nGaddafi called the rebels who rose up against his 42 years of one-man rule `` rats , '' but in the end it appeared that it was he who was captured cowering in a drainage pipe full of rubbish and filth . \n`` He called us rats , but look where we found him , '' said Ahmed Al Sahati , a 27-year-old government fighter , standing next to two stinking drainage pipes under a six-lane highway near Sirte . \nOn the ground , government fighters described scenes of carnage as they told stories of Gaddafi 's final hours . \nShortly before dawn prayers , Gaddafi , surrounded by a few dozen loyal bodyguards and accompanied by the head of his now non-existent army Abu Bakr Younis Jabr , broke out of the two-month siege of Sirte and made a break for the west . \nThey did not get far . \nFrance said its aircraft struck military vehicles belonging to Gaddafi forces near Sirte at about 8:30 a.m. -LRB- 0630 GMT -RRB- , but said it was unsure whether the strikes had killed Gaddafi . \nA NATO official said the convoy was hit either by a French plane or a U.S. Predator drone . \nTwo miles west of Sirte , 15 pick-up trucks mounted with machine guns lay burned out , smashed and smoldering next to an electricity substation 20 meters from the main road . \nThey had clearly been hit by a force far beyond anything the motley army the former rebels has assembled during eight months of revolt to overthrow the once feared leader . \nThere was no bomb crater , indicating the strike may have been carried out by a jet fighter . \nInside the trucks still in their seats sat the charred skeletal remains of drivers and passengers killed instantly by the strike . \nOther bodies lay mutilated and contorted strewn across the grass . \nSome 50 bodies in all . \nMansour Daou , leader of Gaddafi 's personal bodyguards , was with the former strongman shortly before his end . \nHe told al Arabiya television that after the air strike the survivors had `` split into groups and each group went its own way . '' \n`` I was with Gaddafi and Abu Bakr Younis Jabr and about four volunteer soldiers . '' \nDaou said he had not witnessed his leader 's death because he had fallen unconscious after being wounded in the back by a shell explosion . \nFighters on the ground said Gaddafi and a handful of his men appeared to have run through a stand of trees and taken refuge in the two drainage pipes . \n`` At first we fired at them with anti-aircraft guns , but it was no use , '' said Salem Bakeer , while being feted by his comrades near the road . \n`` Then we went in on foot . \n`` One of Gaddafi 's men came out waving his rifle in the air and shouting surrender , but as soon as he saw my face he started shooting at me , '' he told Reuters . \n`` Then I think Gaddafi must have told them to stop . \n` My master is here , my master is here ' , he said , ` Muammar Gaddafi is here and he is wounded ' , '' said Bakeer . \n`` We went in and brought Gaddafi out . \nHe was saying ` what 's wrong ? \nWhat 's going on ? ' . \nThen we took him and put him in the car , '' Bakeer said . \nAt the time of his capture , Gaddafi was already wounded with gunshots to his leg and to his back , Bakeer said . \nOther government fighters who said they took part in Gaddafi 's capture , separately confirmed Bakeer 's version of events , though one said the man who ruled Libya for 42 years was shot and wounded at the last minute by one of his own men . \n`` One of Muammar Gaddafi 's guards shot him in the chest , '' said Omran Jouma Shawan . \nThere were also other versions of events . \nNTC official Abdel Majid Mlegta told Reuters Gaddafi had been finally cornered in a compound in Sirte after hours of fighting , and wounded in a gun battle with NTC forces . \nHe said Gaddafi kept repeating `` What is the matter ? \nWhat 's going on ? \nWhat do you want ?

{"txt": "U.S. Northeast digs out from blizzard , tornado strikes in South . \nFull Article ANALYSIS - Could Libya war crimes talk just entrench Gaddafi ? \nLONDON | Wed Mar 2 , 2011 6:54 pm IST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Foreign powers hope threatening Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi with a war crimes trial at The Hague will help drive him from office , but some worry such talk might instead leave him thinking he has no way out . \nThe United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to refer Libya to the International Criminal Court following its crackdown on protesters . \nICC chief prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said on Monday attacks on civilians could be a crime against humanity and warranted a full investigation . \nBut -- just as with previous ICC probes into Congolese warlords , Sudan 's president and Uganda 's Lord 's Resistance Army -- there is the lingering worry that prosecutions will make compromise and finding a solution harder . \n`` It 's a delicate balance that has to be struck , '' said one senior U.S. diplomat , who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue . \n`` It 's a difficult balancing act , '' said Alia Brahimi , a research fellow on North Africa at the London School of Economics . \n`` There is a risk that taking an absolute moral and legalistic approach and talking about war crimes charges simply reinforces Gaddafi 's idea that he has nowhere else to go and no option to step down . \nBut on the flip side , it sends a strong message to those around him . '' \nHomegrown amnesty , truth and reconciliation processes -- rather than international prosecutions -- have been key to the resolution of several political crises or conflicts once thought intractable , such as the conflict between South Africa 's white apartheid rulers and the black majority . \nMany also doubt Northern Ireland 's decades of violence could have been brought hopefully to a close if Britain had still been looking to prosecute sometime IRA militants . \nA week into Libya 's uprising , the country is effectively divided between Gaddafi loyalist and opposition forces in what some fear could be the opening stages of a civil war . \nForeign governments say hundreds if not thousands have been killed already , while aid agencies fear a humanitarian crisis . \nOutside powers demand that Gaddafi stand down , threatening no-fly zones , sanctions and possibly further military action -- although critics say that can also back intransigent rulers into a corner . \nBut the foreign powers say the risk of war crimes charges should deter followers from attacking civilians and might help prompt his ouster . \n`` International prosecutions can sometimes carry risks , such as causing brutal dictators to entrench rather than step down and face justice , '' said Matthew Waxman , professor at Columbia Law School and fellow at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations . \n`` However , -LRB- they -RRB- can also help isolate perpetrators ... hastening their demise while also laying the foundation for longer term stability and serving broader interests in justice and deterrence . '' \nIt is possible any war crimes prosecution could still be halted in its tracks if foreign powers chose to do so . \nInterviewed by Reuters in 2005 shortly before the ICC issued an arrest warrant for the head of Uganda 's LRA leader Joseph Kony , prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo said he might in general agree to halting proceedings in a country if that would bring peace . \nSome in Uganda and elsewhere had warned that issuing warrants against the LRA for child abduction and killing might make it impossible to reach an agreement with them . \nKony ultimately refused to sign a peace deal after talks hosted by South Sudan , some say because he feared ICC prosecution . \nHe and his fighters fled into nearby Congo and are still at large , continuing to raid villages there and in Sudan . \nBut Human Rights Watch 's head of the international justice program , Richard Dicker , said it was now barely even legally possible to simply cancel proceedings . \n`` The world has changed with the passing of the Rome Statute , '' he said , referring to the 2002 treaty establishing the ICC . \n`` There 's just not the legal option to offer ... to stop the legal process . \nThe option of letting Gaddafi walk away without any legal consequences just is n't on the table any more . '' \nIn reality , international justice remains likely to be highly selective . \nAny one of the permanent five UN Security Council members of the U.S. , Britain , France , Russia or China can effectively block a probe . \nThat means Chinese actions in Tibet and elsewhere , Russian clampdowns in Chechnya or alleged Western abuses in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay are all off the agenda . \nClose friends of Security Council powers such as U.S. ally Israel or China 's friends Myanmar or Sri Lanka also tend to enjoy more diplomatic cover . \n`` It 's a far from perfect system ... an uneven playing field , '' said Human Rights Watch 's Dicker . \n`` But I believe ... we are moving in the right direction . \nIf you look at eastern Congo , you have warlords who have been given amnesty time and time again ... in a short-term search for peace . \nThey have returned to commit even more vicious atrocities . \nYou have to have systems that will bring justice . '' \nOthers say that -- like the threat of economic sanctions or military action -- at the end of the day the prosecution threat may simply become another diplomatic bargaining chip . \n`` A war crimes indictment demonstrates the resolve of the international community , '' said Thomas Barnett , chief analyst of political risk consultancy Wikistrat . \n`` To the extent that it pushes an embattled leader into a corner , it can likewise be retracted as part of the collective bargaining for an acceptable exit scenario for the leader , his family and top associates .

{"txt": "Commanders weigh their options as ` Juba ' notches up more kills Friday 5 August 2005 00.01 BST They have never seen Juba . \nThey hear him , but by then it 's too late : a shot rings out and another US soldier slumps dead or wounded . \nThere is never a follow-up shot , never a chance for US forces to identify the origin , to make the hunter the hunted . \nHe fires once and vanishes . \nJuba is the nickname given by American forces to an insurgent sniper operating in southern Baghdad . \nThey do not know his appearance , nationality or real name , but they know and fear his skill . \n`` He 's good , '' said Specialist Travis Burress , 22 , a sniper with the 1-64 battalion based in Camp Rustamiyah . \n`` Every time we dismount I 'm sure everyone has got him in the back of their minds . \nHe 's a serious threat to us . '' \nGun attacks occasionally pepper the battalion 's foot and mounted patrols , but the single crack of what is thought to be a Tobuk sniper rifle inspires particular dread . \nSince February , the killing of at least two members of the battalion and the wounding of six more have been attributed to Juba . \nSome think it is also he that has picked off up to a dozen other soldiers . \nIn a war marked by sectarian bombings and civilian casualties , Juba is unusual in targeting only coalition troops , a difficult quarry protected by armored vehicles , body armor and helmets . \nHe waits for soldiers to dismount , or stand up in a Humvee turret , and aims for gaps in their body armor , the lower spine , ribs or above the chest . \nHe has killed from 200 metres away . \n`` It was the perfect shot , '' the battalion commander , Lt Col Kevin Farrell , said of one incident . \n`` Blew out the spine . \n`` We have different techniques to try to lure him out , but he is very well trained and very patient . \nHe does n't fire a second shot . '' \nSome in the battalion want marksmen to occupy rooftops overlooking supply routes , Juba 's hunting ground , to try to put him in the cross-hairs . \n`` It would be a pretty shitty assignment because he 's good , '' said Spc Burress . \n`` I think it 's a sniper 's job to get a sniper , and it 'd probably take all of us to get him . '' \nAmerican snipers operate in teams of at least two people , a shooter and a spotter , the latter requiring more experience since he must use complicated formulae to calculate factors such as wind strength and drag coefficients . \nSome worry that Juba is on his way to becoming a resistance hero , acclaimed by those Iraqis who distinguish between `` good '' insurgents , who target only Americans , and `` bad '' insurgents who harm civilians . \nThe insurgent grapevine celebrates an incident last June when a four-strong marine scout sniper team was killed in Ramadi , all with shots to the head . \nUnlike their opponents , US snipers in Baghdad seldom get to shoot . \nTypically they hide on rooftops and use thermal imaging and night vision equipment to monitor areas . \nIf there is suspicious activity , they summon aircraft or ground patrols . \n`` We are professionals . \nThere is a line between a maniac with a gun and a sniper , '' said Mike , 31 , a corporal with a reconnaissance sniper platoon who did not want to his surname to be used . \nHe spoke during a 24-hour mission on a roof during which his team ate junk food and urinated into a bottle . \nDuring daylight they lay on the ground , immobile , to avoid being seen . \n`` It 's not a glamorous life , '' he said . \nThere was no sign of Juba , who tended to operate further east , but the team spotted mortar flashes and fed the coordinates to base . \nMike said he had shot 14 people in Somalia , three in Afghanistan and one in Iraq . \n`` It 's not like you expect it to be , an emotional high . \nYou just think about the wind , the range , then it 's over with . '' \nSniper fire is only of the threats for an American military that has suffered heavy losses this week . \nYesterday another soldier was killed in Ramadi , west of Baghdad , adding to the 21 who died in attacks on Monday and Wednesday . \nRoadside bombs account for most of the lives lost , and the size and design of the explosions has led investigators to conclude that the insurgents are learning bombmaking methods from other terrorist organizations . \nYesterday 's New York Times reported that the techniques used by Hezbollah in Lebanon were increasingly being seen in roadside bombs in Iraq . \nAn unnamed senior American commander quoted by the paper said bombs using shaped charges closely matched the bombs that Hezbollah used against Israel . \n`` Our assessment is that they are probably going off to ` school ' to learn how to make bombs that can destroy armored vehicles , '' he said .

'' \nAn independent firm hired by BP wrote in an April letter that it had substantiated allegations by a former contractor that the petroleum company was violating its own policies on the Atlantis , which is stationed more than 150 miles from New Orleans in 7,070 feet of water . \nBillie Pirner Garde , a deputy ombudsman , wrote to contractor Kenneth Abbott and stated that multiple workers on the Atlantis had raised similar safety concerns . \n`` The concerns that you expressed regarding the status of the drawings upgrade project were not unique to you , '' Garde wrote . \n`` It was a challenge to the Project and of concern to others who raised the concern before you worked there , while you were there and after you left . '' \nIn February , two months before an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon , more than a dozen members of Congress called on the Minerals Management Service , the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling , to investigate Abbott 's complaints . \nAn agency probe is ongoing . \nAn attorney for BP wrote a letter to Congress in January saying the company was compliant with all federal requirements and the Atlantis has been operating so safely that it received an MMS award , the Associated Press reported . \nAccording to one document unearthed in the course of a dispute between Abbott and the oil company , BP production member Barry C. Duff wrote in an August 2008 e-mail that `` hundreds if not thousands '' of engineering documents were incomplete , and suggested these insufficient safety records `` could lead to catastrophic operator errors . '' \nThe documents were first reported by the Associated Press on Saturday afternoon . \nDavid Perry , a lawyer who has represented Abbott in his efforts to shut down the Atlantis , said his client was stunned to discover the rig had `` incomplete , if not inaccurate engineering documents '' when he started working for the company in September 2008 , roughly a year after the operation began . \nAbbott helped oversee BP 's safety compliance and the database that contained the necessary safety records as part of the project 's management team . \n`` All of the documents should have been completed before they started production , '' Perry said in an interview . \n`` He walked in the door and there was a problem . '' \nAbbott , he said , `` feels like his efforts to fix the problem got him terminated . '' \nIn the letter to Abbott , Garde dismissed the idea that he had been retaliated against . \nShe also wrote that the `` Project Execution Plan '' BP had violated was `` a BP internal document , not a regulatory requirement . '' \nAbbott and his lawyers have appealed repeatedly to senior Interior Department officials to shut down operations on the rig . \n`` The only way to protect the Gulf of Mexico marine environment from this potential for catastrophe is to halt production from this platform until the massive safety failures related to Project Atlantis are rectified , '' Perry wrote in May 2009 to an attorney-adviser in the mineral resources division in Interior 's solicitor general 's office . \nLate Saturday , BP spokesman Andrew Gowers said the company had taken Abbott 's allegations seriously and investigated them thoroughly . \n`` It is my understanding that our investigation found that the operators on the platform had full access to the accurate , up-to-date drawings -LRB- topsides , hull and subsea -RRB- necessary to operate the platform safely , '' he wrote . \n`` I also understand that there was an issue around whether the electronic filing of those drawings was consistent with the project execution plan , but the key fact is that the operators on the platform had access to the drawings they needed for safe operation .

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the news briefing that while the newly-discovered virus strain now appears mild , it needs to be closely watched as it spreads around the world and starts to afflict impoverished countries . \n`` We may be in a grace period with H1N1 but we are still in the danger zone , '' Ban said . \nEarlier on Tuesday , the United Nations chief said it was essential for drugmakers to work with governments to avert the worst potential impacts of the flu , which has killed 79 people and infected nearly 10,000 . \n`` Partnerships with the private sector are absolutely vital , '' he told representatives of the WHO 's 193 member governments gathered in Geneva , urging them to think beyond their borders in their response to the H1N1 strain . \nThough most people infected so far have experienced mild symptoms similar to the common flu , pregnant women and people with HIV\\/AIDS , diabetes and other health problems appear to be vulnerable to more severe effects like pneumonia . \nHealth experts have said weather could affect the continued spread of the virus , with more cases expected as countries in the southern hemisphere move into winter . \nFlu viruses typically thrive in cold and dry environments . \nPharmaceutical executives taking part in Tuesday 's vaccines meeting at the WHO 's Geneva headquarters said they were primed to ramp up production of H1N1 vaccines if needed , and would await more directions about how to balance their output . \n`` Our companies stand ready to produce H1N1 vaccines when the recommendation comes from the WHO , '' the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations said . \nSix companies have pledged to make 10 percent of the vaccine they produce available for distribution to poor countries , and eight are in talks about donations , said Gelmer Leibbrandt , general manager of Schering-Plough 's Nobilon . \nChan said that vaccine makers have shown `` a very serious commitment '' to help the international community prepare for a pandemic of flu , which could be mild in its effects to start and become more severe as it circles the globe . \nQuestions remain about whether an H1N1-only vaccine is needed in the near-term -- especially if its production cuts the world 's supply of injections for seasonal flu , which kills up to 500,000 people a year and causes severe illness in millions . \nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said pharmaceutical companies should ramp up their production of seasonal flu shots and then later switch to pandemic injection making `` if that is necessary . '' \n`` There is still so much uncertainty about this virus that it is really premature for us to even make a determination about how many people would appropriately be vaccinated , in what order , how many doses will be required , at what point . \nAll those discussions are still very much underway , '' Sebelius said . \nBan , in his remarks to the World Health Assembly , called on wealthy nations to help support poorer states fight the flu . \nBut one international official said he expected battles ahead as governments try to secure finite supplies of antiviral drugs and vaccines to protect their populations . \n`` Enabling poor countries to be able to access the various medical supplies they need is going to be a critical political and technical issue , '' he said . \n`` This issue will require political attention .

'' \nIn anticipation of the storm , ships working at the oil spill site moved to safer waters and coastal workers packed up oil removal operations . \nThe storm now seems a less likely threat to cleanup , but is expected to bring periods of heavy rainfall , strong winds , and dangerous surf to the Gulf states . \nBonnie could reach the northern Gulf Coast tonight or early tomorrow after passing over the oil spill midday Saturday . \nThe center of Bonnie came ashore Friday near Cutler Bay , about 20 miles south of Miami . \nIt moved into the eastern Gulf and was about 215 miles east-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River at 8 a.m. EDT Saturday . \nThough officials along the coast expressed frustration at the sudden halt to cleanup and containment , several said they saw no choice , given the looming arrival of bad weather . \nThe mechanical cap that has mostly contained the oil for eight days was left closed , and there was no worry the storm could cause any problems with the plug because it 's nearly a mile below the ocean 's surface . \n`` Preservation of life and preservation of equipment are our highest priorities , '' said Allen , the federal government 's spill chief who ordered the evacuation of most ships 40 miles from the Louisiana coast With many of the protective barriers that had been shielding Louisiana 's coastal marshes locked away in warehouses , oil began to seep into fragile ecosystems that had been relatively unscathed ; the black blotches were visible in the waters off St. Bernard Parish , just east of New Orleans 's French Quarter , The Wall Street Journal reported . \n`` We ca n't do anything about it , '' said parish spokeswoman Jennifer Belsom about current skimming operations . \nBut she expects them to resume Monday . \nWorkers on land readied for a possible storm surge that could push oil into the sensitive marsh areas along the coast . \nOn the tiny resort island of Grand Isle off the southeast Louisiana coast , workers packed up the oil removal operation , tearing down tents , tying down clean boom and loading oil-soaked boom into large containers so it wo n't pollute the area if the storm causes flooding . \n`` We 're planning for a 2-to-3-foot storm surge so anything that would be affected by that is being moved or stored , '' said Big Joe Kramer , 55 , who is working on his fourth large spill for Miller Environmental Services , Inc. . \nAt the spill site , the water no longer looks thick with gooey tar . \nBut the oil is still there beneath the surface , staining the hulls of boats motoring around in it . \nThe evacuation could delay the relief well for as long as two weeks , pushing back the attempt to definitively shut down the leak by intercepting the well to late August , BP officials said . \nBut an attempt to flood the well with drilling mud and cement could be tried shortly after the ships get back to the drilling site , Allen said . \nBefore the cap was attached and closed a week ago , the broken well spewed 94 million gallons -LRB- 355 million liters -RRB- to 184 million gallons -LRB- 696 million liters -RRB- into the Gulf after the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nThe plug is so far beneath the ocean surface , scientists say even a severe storm should n't damage it . \n`` There 's almost no chance it 'll have any impact on the well head or the cap because it 's right around 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- deep and even the largest waves wo n't get down that far , '' said Don Van Nieuwenhuise , director of professional geoscience programs at the University of Houston . \nThe `` Great Snowstorm '' came to an end . \nThis storm produced the heaviest snowfall over the largest area of any storm studied by weather historian David Ludlum . \nAccumulations exceeded 10 inches from the Ohio Valley across much of the Atlantic coast north of Georgia . \nWashington , DC reported 13 inches with 18 inches at Baltimore , Maryland , 18 to 36 inches near Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , 15 to 20 inches at new York city , and 20 to 30 inches over southern New England . \nThe second severe arctic outbreak of the year hit the United States . \nA vast anticyclone from British Columbia to Louisiana , was centered over Kansas at 30.50 inches . \nThe zero line went into Texas with the temperature at Amarillo falling from 55 degrees to 1 degree below zero and Oklahoma city dropping from 62 degrees to 10 degrees . \nA winter storm produced 61 inches of snow at Rye , Colorado , and wind gusts to 100 mph in Utah . \nThe storm then spread heavy snow from the Texas Panhandle to Indiana . \nTulia , Texas received 16 inches of snow , and up to 14 inches blanketed western Oklahoma . \nA powerful Pacific storm battered the coast of southern California . \nWinds gusting to 65 mph uprooted trees in the San Diego area , while Los Angeles recorded a barometric pressure reading of 29.25 inches of mercury -- the lowest in 100 years of official record keeping . \nHeavy snow fell across the Prince Williams Sound area and the Susitna Valley of southern Alaska . \nValdez was buried under 64.9 inches of snow in less than two days , including a record 47.5 inches in 24 hours . \nUp to 44 inches of snow was reported in the Susitna Valley . \nThe heavy snow sank a half dozen vessels in the harbor . \nBitterly cold air prevailed across the great lakes and the northeastern U.S. Alpena , Michigan dipped to 28 degrees below zero to tie its record low for January . \nRochester , New York plunged to 17 degrees below zero for a new record low temperature for January . \nBoston , Massachusetts mean temperature for the day was only 2 degrees -- the city 's coldest day in 26 years . \nWatertown , New York was the cold spot in the nation , with a morning low of 43 degrees below zero . \nWilliston , North Dakota recorded 12.6 inches of snow in 24 hour for its greatest 24 hour snowfall on record . \nThe temperature plunged to 50 degrees below zero at Big Black River , Maine for the state 's coldest temperature on record .

{"txt": "WASHINGTON | Tue May 18 , 2010 7:56 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. Congress is turning its focus this week to the federal government 's response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , but the offshore oil drilling industry is far from off the hook . \nCongressional pressure on federal agencies , especially the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service , is likely to lead to tighter rules for the oil and natural gas sector . \nThe Senate Homeland Security committee kicked off a series of hearings examining the government 's role in the cleanup of the massive oil leak threatening the U.S. Gulf Coast on Monday with testimony from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar and Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson are scheduled to answer lawmakers ' questions regarding the rig disaster on Tuesday . \nExecutives from BP Plc and Transocean Ltd will also face more congressional grilling this week . \nBP is already facing legislation that would make the company pay more for the economic damages resulting from the rig accident . \nMeanwhile , the White House last week offered its own legislative plan to pay for the spill . \nFollowing is a look at some of the new laws and regulations that may result from the spill . \nFacing attacks for not doing enough to prevent the rig disaster , the Interior Department last week announced it would change the way it oversees offshore drilling . \nIn addition to separating the Minerals Management Service 's oil royalty collection and safety inspection roles , the department is reviewing environmental permitting procedures for offshore oil production . \nAs part of the shift , the Obama administration has asked for an additional $ 29 million to pay for more inspections of offshore platforms and a review of procedures . \nThe overhaul is expected to lead to stricter regulations of offshore drilling . \nWith the agency coming under heavy fire for allowing BP to bypass some environmental studies , there will likely be more stringent environmental analysis and oil spill response plans . \nRegulators will also likely establish more rules regarding the equipment and techniques used in offshore oil production . \nThe current focus on faulty blowout preventers and well cementing procedures as a possible causes for the accident will likely lead to more standards in those areas . \nInterior has placed a moratorium on any new offshore drilling permits until at least May 28 when a safety review is due to be completed . \nAny significant extension of this moratorium could have a major impact on offshore drilling companies and lower projected Gulf oil production . \nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs chairman Joseph Lieberman said on Monday that until questions surrounding the preparation and response efforts for this deepwater oil spill are answered , the government should not allow any new deepwater wells to be permitted and drilled . \nSome lawmakers from coastal states have also called for a complete halt to offshore drilling in any new areas , saying the risk is just too great for coastal economies . \nStill other lawmakers are still looking to expand offshore drilling , but with additional protections in place . \nThe Senate climate bill released last week would allow U.S. states to prohibit offshore oil activity within 75 miles of their coasts . \nLawmakers in both chambers have proposed bills that would raise the amount of money BP would be required to dole out for economic losses caused by the spill to $ 10 billion from the current cap of $ 75 million . \nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday said a $ 10 billion liability limit would be `` inadequate , '' however . \nWhile it is unclear exactly how much the cap will be lifted , it is almost certain that BP and other oil companies drilling offshore will be responsible for covering much more than $ 75 million in economic losses in the future . \nThere are also likely to be changes to the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund , authorized for use in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez disaster . \nLawmakers are considering raising the 8 cent per barrel fee the industry pays to support the fund by 1 to 25 cents . \nThe White House proposal released last week would increase this per barrel fee by 1 cent . \nDemocratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey has introduced legislation that would impose an annual fee of $ 10 for every acre leased for offshore drilling to raise money for clean energy transportation technology . \nLautenberg said the fee could raise $ 1.8 billion a year . \nThe additional fees and liability risks could hurt smaller oil and natural gas operators offshore that may not be able to handle the costs . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOn April 28.2010 Ken Salazar announced his decision at a joint Massachusetts State House news conference with Gov. Deval Patrick voting to go forward with the Nantucket , Massachusetts wind turbine project . \nThe same day of this decision more than 5000 barrels of oil had poured into the Gulf of Mexico . \n-LRB- one barrel equals 42 gallons -RRB- . \nWe have to ask who was in charge of MMS while Ken was in Boston ? \nDo we trust our government ? \nThe federal government aka the Mineral Management Service gave the Cape Wind permit while the Gulf of Mexico was being destroyed . \nThe MMS permits should all be reviewed including the ocean wind permit ! \nMMS spent more time on the Cape Wind permit while they could have been doing their job in the Gulf What they should be focusing on is how to stop the leak ... there will be plenty of time to point fingers and fix the system later . \nI do n't understand why this has n't been resolved , if I had the particulars -LRB- design drawings -RRB- and pictures of the piping I could already have designed a solution -LRB- or two -RRB- ... the fact that the leaks continue is mind boggling ! \nWell you do n't have to me a expert to know that the oil will soon get into the Gulf Stream and at 5 miles per hour . \nA little onshore winds and the whole east coast of Fla first then the USA will have tar balls floating up on its beaches . \nAnd BP that says it will pay for all bills related should have 10,000 workers daily till every freken ball is picked up . \nLarger problem they probably have 20 more wells with same defective blowout valves ... . . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-05-18__2089.rsd.txt"}
{"txt": "ROME | Wed Apr 29 , 2009 3:58 pm BST ROME -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italy 's first family soap opera was back on the front pages Wednesday after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 's wife said his party 's selection of women to run in European elections was a `` shamelessly trashy '' process . \nVeronica Berlusconi , who has publicly lamented her husband 's eye for younger women in the past , also accused him of going to the birthday bash of an 18-year-old woman in Naples but not attending the coming-of-age-parties of his own children . \nVeronica , 52 , who rarely appears with her husband , said she agreed with Italian newspapers ' descriptions of her husband 's party 's choice of female candidates as `` entertainment for the emperor , '' in what newspapers saw as a reference to him . \nShe said it was absurd that women should consider themselves excluded from politics just because they had been on television or in show business . \n`` Women in Politics -- Veronica 's Wrath , '' was the way La Stampa of Turin put it . \nIn an e-mail to Italian news agency Ansa , she praised politicians such as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and German Chancellor Angela Merkel and then added : `` But what 's happening today -LRB- in Italy -RRB- behind a front of bodily curves and female beauty is grave . '' \nShe added that it offended all women and particularly those who had fought in the `` frontline '' for women 's equality . \nHer 72-year-old husband , speaking to reporters during a trip to Warsaw , said he was sorry his wife had apparently believed `` what she read in the papers '' and added that it was all `` a campaign -LRB- against him -RRB- hyped by the leftist press . '' \nThe controversy exploded earlier this week when an on-line magazine close to Berlusconi 's main conservative ally , lower house speaker Gianfranco Fini , criticised how centre-right women candidates were being chosen for the June European elections . \nThat article , seen by some media as a reference to Berlusconi 's party , said women politicians could not be used like `` pieces of costume jewellery '' to attract votes . \nBerlusconi 's People of Freedom party is considering a number of former actresses and television personalities as possible candidates in the June European election , media reports say . \nAs party leader , he has a powerful voice in who makes the list . \n`` Some have written that it is all part of entertainment for the emperor . \nI agree , '' Veronica said . \n`` What is emerging from newspapers is shamelessly trashy , all in the name of power . '' \nBerlusconi told reporters in Warsaw it was `` absurd '' that women who speak several languages and have several degrees should consider themselves excluded from politics just because they had been on television or in show business . \nVeronica Berlusconi also took her husband to task for recently dropping in at the birthday party in Naples of an 18-year-old woman whose father is a political acquaintance . \n`` That surprised me very much too , '' Veronica said , `` Even because he never came to the 18th birthday parties of his children , even though he was invited . '' \nBerlusconi has three children with Veronica and two by his first marriage . \nHe has been in hot water with her several times in the past in a very public way . \nTwo years ago , she criticised him for flirting with young starlets at a party . \nHe later issued a syrupy public apology in the press , saying : `` I beg you to forgive me .

{"txt": "Sunday , May 16 , 2010 ; 4:43 PM BP inserted a new tube Sunday into the damaged oil pipe that has been gushing oil from the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico for three and a half weeks in a bid to capture as much of the oil as possible . \nThe four-inch wide new pipe was inserted into the broken section known as the riser , from which the majority of the oil has been leaking . \nIf it works , the inserted pipe could keep a substantial amount of the oil out of the sea by siphoning it up a mile-long pipe to the Discoverer Enterprise drillship and then to nearby barges . \n`` So far it 's working extremely well , '' said BP senior vice president for exploration and production Kent Wells . \nHe said the company has been able to flare , or burn , some of the natural gas at the surface , an indication that the insertion pipe is working . \nHe said it would not be clear how much of the oil can be captured for another day or two , but he called it `` a positive step forward . '' \n`` As of now there are still reasonably substantial amounts of oil coming out '' of the damaged pipeline into the ocean , said Andrew Gowers , an executive vice president at BP . \n`` That is in part a factor of the pressure we are bringing to bear in producing the oil . '' \nHe added that the amount of oil brought up the new line would `` be steadily increased . '' \nHe cautioned `` this is a gradual , carefully calibrated process aimed at steadily reducing the leak rather than a magic bullet . '' \nIt also remained unclear how the effort to capture oil from the main leak would affect a smaller leak closer to the well . \nThe company 's efforts to stop the flow of oil into the Gulf of Mexico come as the existing slick has begun to touch shorelines and come closer to currents that could carry plumes of oil suspended beneath the surface out of the Gulf to areas much further away , including the Florida Keys . \nLate Saturday night , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a 72-hour forecast that warned , `` As the winds weaken , ocean models indicate the southern edge of the plume could begin moving more to the SW and potentially into the Loop Current . '' \nBP said that while it tries to siphon oil up its new insertion pipe , it was also making preparations to `` kill '' the damaged well at the sea surface by pumping drilling mud at higher pressure and weight than the oil . \nThe mud would be pumped at more than 30,000 horsepower engine through three-inch hoses and through `` choke '' valves at the bottom of the blowout preventer near the sea floor . \nHe said the valves could shoot up to 40 barrels a minute of mud into the well . \n`` We 'll be able to pump much faster than the well can flow , '' he said . \n`` It 's about us outrunning the well . '' \nWells said the company had brought 50,000 barrels of the mud , a mixture of clay and other substances , for the effort , which he said should be far more than needed . \nHe said that the much ridiculed `` junk shot , '' in which golf balls and shredded tires would be fired into the blowout preventer , would only be used if the drilling mud were being forced upward and needed to be blocked . \nWells said it would be another week to 10 days before preparations for what the company has called the `` top kill '' effort would be complete . \nIn the meantime , BP pressed ahead with its insertion pipe , which has been compared to inserting a straw into another straw . \nBP 's pipe is somewhat more sophisticated than a straw ; it has rubber components to seal off the pipe as much as possible from sea water while letting oil and gas push their way in to the new pipe . \nBP is also pumping 120 degree water and methanol into the long pipe in an effort to prevent the formation of crystals of gas hydrates . \nThose hydrates -- combinations of natural gas and sea water at high pressures and low temperatures -- form slush-like crystals that can block pipelines or even lift heavy objects off the sea floor . \nThey were one reason for the failure of an earlier effort to lower a 98-ton steel coffer dam over the main leak site . \nOnce the oil , gas and water mixture reaches ships on the surface , it will be processed and separated into different components . \nGas is already being flared , and the oil will be loaded onto barges or tankers . \nSunday 's insertion was BP 's second effort . \nLate Saturday night after the new tube was inserted , it was yanked out after the umbilical cord of a remotely-operated vehicle got entangled with the tube 's line to the surface , according to sources familiar with the project . \nStaff writer Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report '' This Story : Read + | Watch + | ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_washingtonpost/rsd/bpoil_washingtonpost__2010-05-16__568.rsd.txt"}

{"txt": "-LRB- Oliver Munday for The Washington Post -RRB- The festive mood of Friday lunch at Galatoire 's did not seem changed since the first time I ate at the 105-year-old New Orleans institution in the late 1950s : the ladies resplendent in their hats and finery , the gents in their seersucker suits , the gin and bourbon flowing like water . \nThe merriment belied the tragic reality of the day 's headline : P&J , the city 's 134-year-old oyster company , had stopped shucking that morning . \nI was in New Orleans to speak at a culinary conference , and of course we ate well , including a three-hour lunch of pig dishes at Cochon . \nI had a crabmeat omelet at Galatoire 's , which has issued a public statement about the oil-spill disaster in the gulf : `` Nearly 80 percent of Louisiana 's seafood comes from thousands of miles of coastline west of the Mississippi River , hundreds of miles away from the currently affected areas of the Gulf of Mexico . \nGalatoire 's has taken steps to support our seafood producers and ensure that the freshest , highest quality fish , shrimp , crawfish and crabs are available without interruption . '' \nOysters are conspicuous in their absence from the statement , which you can read at Galatoires.com . \nAs Brett Anderson reported in the Times-Picayune on June 13 , the dwindling supply of local oysters in the wake of the oil spill forced Galatoire 's executive chef Brian Landry to scour the restaurant 's decades of menus , looking for traditional dishes to replace those featuring the local bivalves . \nChicken livers en brochette , however , just do n't appeal to me as much as oysters prepared the same way . \nAs food writers , we were already lamenting this latest devastating blow to the vibrant cuisine . \nAt the end of the conference and before the speakers ' dinner , I slipped away in a merciful rain shower with culinary scholar Jessica Harris and Latin chefs Maricel Presilla and Patricia Wilson -LRB- all three PhDs -RRB- to Dickie Brennan 's nearby Bourbon House , renowned for the quality of its oysters . \nWe were reassured that the oysters were all from Area 9 in Plaquemines , west of the Mississippi River . \nIt 's one of two areas that have been reopened temporarily as the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals tests gulf oysters and oyster waters . \nIt was Saturday afternoon , about 5 o'clock . \nBourbon House sits squarely on the corner of Iberville and boisterous Bourbon Street , in the heart of the French Quarter . \nThe Beans + Rice conference -LRB- where we had lectured -RRB- , the Creole Tomato Festival and the Louisiana Seafood Festival were going on simultaneously in the Quarter , so there were even more foodies than normal in New Orleans , if that 's imaginable . \nBut Bourbon House was n't half-full -- at happy hour on Saturday -- and several lesser-known oyster bars we passed were empty . \nI 'm the first to admit that I prefer the brinier East Coast oysters of the R months , if for no other reason than that 's what I grew up with . \nBut , as Presilla noted , the plump , meaty oysters from Plaquemines that we ate on Saturday `` beg to be cooked and sauced . '' \nWe ordered several dozen , both cooked and raw , tossing them back with champagne . \n-LRB- The best I had were the wood-fired ones at Cochon . -RRB- \nWistfully , we snapped cellphone photos of what might well be among the last Gulf Coast oysters for a while . \nWe walked back to the hotel in the rain . \nI do n't get to the Gulf Coast often , but no food writer can ignore the bountiful cornucopia of the New Orleans table . \nThere 's noplace else in the world quite like the Crescent City , with its Creole and Cajun cultures , its sultry weather , its magnificent architecture , its self-proclaimed decadence . \nMardi Gras , Jazz Fest and Friday at Galatoire 's are no more excessive than an ordinary meal in New Orleans . \nMounds of beans and rice , sweetbreads , vegetables swimming in hollandaise and oysters Rockefeller are mere side dishes or appetizers . \nCourses that follow are stuffed with crabmeat , garnished with crawfish and invariably sauced , followed by gumbo , jambalaya or fried soft-shell crabs with sauce Choron . \nFor as long as I can remember , I have eaten oysters , frog 's legs , shrimp , crawfish and drum . \nThat 's because I was born a stone 's throw from the Mississippi , in Baton Rouge . \nWhen I was 3 , we moved to the very similar terrain of the South Carolina low country . \nI have lived through several hurricanes , including Hugo , which put me out of house and business for a year . \nWhen I was growing up , my mother would send me out in our sailboat 's dinghy to catch lunch . \nIn autumn , I would cast our old circular shrimp net into the brackish waters of the salt marsh , pulling in several pounds of shrimp . \nAt low tide in winter , I would gather oysters and clams from the then-pristine waters , my mother tossing back into the creek any oysters under 10 inches long . \nIn spring , the crab trap offered up not only those luscious blue crabs , but flounder and eel as well . \nMy older sister Nancy returned to Louisiana to attend LSU . \nOn the rare occasion that she was home , she gloated about her meals at Galatoire 's : turtle soup , shrimp remoulade , crabmeat omelet , crawfish etouffee and , of course , those oysters . \nShortly after Nancy went away to school , we began spending a lot of time on our sailboat down on the estuaries behind Hilton Head Island . \nFor years ours was one of a handful of pleasure craft docked or moored there . \nWe envied her restaurant meals in Louisiana , but we had a wealth of seafood a cast or trap away . \nThese days , I drive a car , use air conditioning and leave all sorts of appliances and electronic equipment plugged in , their digital clocks constantly draining electricity and increasing our demand for cheap fuel . \nNo matter what I think about BP , I know that I , too , am partly to blame for the oil spill , because I add to that demand . \nWe are all incensed about the ecological damage to the gulf , but multinational oil companies have spilled many millions of gallons in the Niger Delta over the years , polluting the air , water and soil of millions of Nigerians who depend on fish from the rivers simply to sustain their lives . \nI can give you a ballpark estimate of how many turtles and dolphins have washed up dead in the oily mess in the gulf , but I can not tell you the name of a single one of the people who lost their lives in the rig fire . \nI am embarrassed by my own myopia and greed . \nI am livid about the gulf oil spill , and I worry about the seafood industry , but I also know that many of the thousands of jobs affected by the spill are for manual laborers who will never set foot in the temples of Creole cuisine about which I , with my bourgeois tastes and wallet , tend to wax poetic . \nI am angry and worried about the people of Louisiana . \nHow much more can they take ? \nDo I continue to order oysters out of season in hopes of contributing to the demand for them , so that prices will go higher and help the Gulf Coast seafood industry if and when it is able to return to business ? \nDo I continue to write purplish prose about my favorite seafood dishes while fishermen are out of work ? \nThis tragedy should present us all with moral dilemmas . \nI think we must demand change , but change begins at home . \nAs President Obama noted in his June 15 speech about the disaster , `` we ca n't afford not to change how we produce and use energy . '' \nBoycotting BP will only hurt your local gas station owner . \nInstead , slow down , use public transportation , and carpool . \nSet your air conditioning a few degrees higher . \nTurn off your computer and cellphone when they 're not in use . \nAnd this weekend , forgo those bottles of champagne and imported wine and instead write a check to one of the nonprofit groups that are prepared to employ trained volunteers to help clean up the mess and restore the fisheries .

Hollabaugh noted that `` we 're in the beginning stages of the litigation , '' and that it could take as long as a year to complete . \nOne veteran complex litigation attorney estimated that unless there is a quick settlement that satisfies all sides , it will be 2015 before any trials begin and at least 2028 before appeals and other legal issues are fully resolved . \nThe attorney , Lela Hollabaugh of Nashville , Tenn. , pointed out that it took 20 years to complete all claims from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil disaster in Alaska . \n`` When you 're looking at an incident like this , which has so many different parties in different states , you just simply ca n't get through the litigation quickly , '' Hollabaugh said . \n`` It just takes a long time to move through the process . '' \nSo far , at least 300 federal lawsuits have been filed in 12 states against BP and the other three main companies involved in the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , which triggered the nation 's worst-ever offshore oil spill . \nVirtually every lawsuit names as defendants BP , rig owner Transocean Ltd. , well contractor Halliburton Co. and Cameron International , maker of the well 's failed blowout preventer . \nThe plaintiffs make up the entire mosaic of the Gulf Coast : shrimpers and oystermen , charter boat captains , beach resort and condo owners , restaurants and bars , seafood suppliers , bait and tackle shops , even tourist attractions like Key West 's Ripley 's Believe It or Not museum . \nMost of the parties claim severe economic losses from the oil spill , ranging from the fish they can no longer catch to tourists who never arrived to rent rooms . \nThere are also a few wrongful death and injury lawsuits filed , mainly in state courts , by workers who survived the Deepwater Horizon explosion and relatives of some of the 11 men who died . \nAnd some BP investors also have sued , claiming the company 's mistakes led to a sharp drop in its stock price . \nA federal judicial panel is meeting Thursday in Boise , Idaho , to consider whether to consolidate some or all of the lawsuits for pretrial decisions before a single judge , a development that most observers say is a foregone conclusion . \nBP and the other companies favor federal court in Houston -- near their major U.S. operations -- while a majority of plaintiffs ' attorneys have suggested New Orleans , closer to the broken well and to many of the hardest-hit victims . \nCourts in Florida , Mississippi and Alabama also are being suggested as venues . \nIt 's difficult to estimate potential damages that BP could be forced to pay , or what shape a settlement might take . \nBut legal experts say BP alone is looking at some $ 2 billion in costs just to defend itself , with the $ 20 billion fund set aside to pay oil spill claims and cleanup costs potentially not enough to foot the entire bill . \n`` There 's no way it 's going to be enough , '' said Victor Diaz , a Miami attorney experienced in similar large-scale cases such as those involving faulty Chinese drywall . \n`` We still do n't know what will happen later , what the second and third wave of damages might be . \nWhat happens if six months later , some fish species is wiped out ? '' \nOne example of post-spill lawsuits : the owners of a Louisiana shrimp boat claim in a new lawsuit they are suffering health problems including headaches , nausea and shortness of breath after working for BP in the collecting and burning of oil in the Gulf . \nBP 's liability is already larger than the Exxon Valdez case , which ultimately led to a $ 500 million payout to affected fishermen and residents . \nOther large `` mass tort '' cases include drug maker Merck & Co. 's agreement in 2008 to a $ 4.85 billion settlement of some 50,000 cases stemming from its withdrawn painkiller Vioxx . \nAlso , Pharmaceutical company Wyeth initially settled claims over its diet drug fen-phen for $ 3.75 billion in 1999 , but that soared to more than $ 21 billion by 2004 as more claims were filed . \nAsbestos , which has caused widespread lung disease and other ailments , is the longest-running mass lawsuit case in U.S. history , costing a variety of companies more than $ 70 billion and involving more than 730,000 claims since the 1970s , according to an analysis by the nonprofit Rand Corp. . \nAnd tobacco companies have been slapped with thousands of lawsuits over the dangers of cigarette smoking . \nThey won most of them until the major companies agreed in 1998 to a 25-year , $ 206 billion settlement with 46 states who sued over the costs to their health programs . \nThe BP case will differ in many ways from those involving drug companies , automakers and asbestos manufacturers , where people died or suffered illnesses directly caused by the product . \nIn an oil spill , oystermen whose beds were choked off by oil might have relatively easy claims to prove , but what about a beachfront hotelier whose business fell off , or a property owner whose house may suddenly be worth much less ? \n`` People who have those indirect claims are going to have a difficult time under any situation , '' Hollabaugh said . \n`` Where does it end ? \nYou could say the oil spill has harmed our whole country . '' \nMany of the lawsuits are proposed class actions , in which a plaintiff such as a commercial fisherman or a property owner seeks to represent everyone else in the same situation . \nOne task for the judge appointed to preside over the consolidated cases is sorting out which of those overlap , and which should be deemed class actions . \nOne wild card is the claims process created by BP and President Barack Obama 's administration . \nThat process , administered by attorney Kenneth Feinberg , promises oil spill victims quicker access to money for what BP calls `` legitimate '' claims than the traditional legal process . \nFeinberg is touting the plan as a generous alternative to a lawsuit , telling one audience in Washington that although legal action remains an option , `` You 're crazy to do so . '' \nFeinberg made similar arguments in convincing most survivors and victims ' families to join the federal 9\\/11 compensation fund rather than sue airlines or other companies individually over the terror attacks . \nSome plaintiffs ' attorneys have raised questions about how the claims process can guarantee a fair result . \nBut Howard Erichson , a law professor at Fordham University , said people also are taking their chances with the court system . \n`` Litigation is expensive , it 's time-consuming , it is unpredictable , '' Erichson said . \n`` The results often vary in unpredictable ways . \nPlaintiffs in mass tort litigation end up losing a lot of the money to legal fees and expenses . \nIf the compensation fund is fair , I 'm all for it . '' \nAnother unknown is whether BP and the other Deepwater Horizon companies will work together to defend themselves or sue each other . \nMuch depends on the outcome of a Justice Department criminal investigation that could point the finger more heavily at one or the other ; Transocean is already asking a federal judge in Houston to limit its liability to $ 27 million under a century-old law meant to cut losses for shipping companies when vessels like the floating Deepwater Horizon rig are sunk . \nSomewhat forgotten in all the economic litigation are the rig victims and their families . \nMichelle Jones , the wife of lost rig worker Gordon Jones , wants to keep her lawsuit separate so it does not get lost in the shuffle . \n`` While the damages incurred by the fishermen and property owners is significant , the stakes in Jones ' case involves everyday living expenses and the education costs for her two children , '' Michelle Jones ' attorney wrote in a federal court filing . \n`` After losing her husband , and her sons losing their father , she may have to wait years .

'' \nEmerging from 42 years of often brutal one-man rule , many Libyans are savoring the end of eight months of bitter civil war won with NATO 's backing and are unconcerned about how Gaddafi met his end and how his body was treated afterwards . \n`` Throw him in a hole , in the sea , in garbage . \nHe is lower than a donkey or a dog and only foreigners say they care about how we killed him . \nAnd they are lying , '' said engineer Ali Azzarog , 47 . \nHatred of Gaddafi unified his disparate opponents , who will likely now tussle for power during a planned transition to democracy in a nation riven with regional and tribal rivalries . \nWith economic problems at home , NATO countries are expected to endorse an end to their U.N.-mandated mission in Libya when their ambassadors meet in Brussels on Wednesday after a preliminary decision last week to end it on October 31 . \n`` We said that we would consult closely with the United Nations and the NTC and that process of consultations is ongoing , '' NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said . \nLibyan interim Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni said he wanted NATO to maintain its mission for another month , but hoped for a swift end to United Nations sanctions to free up funds for the interim government to pay salaries and help reconstruction . \nNATO spokeswoman Lungescu declined to say whether NATO might extend the mission . \n`` I do n't know whether there is a formal request . \nAll these things remain to be sorted out . \nBut in the end this is a political decision , '' she said . \nNATO 's Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs and Security Policy , James Appathurai , said he expected the alliance to confirm its decision to end the mission . \n`` I do n't expect that there will be a change to that decision , because it is quite clear that the pro-Gaddafi elements no longer have the command and control or other capabilities to pose an organized threat to civilians . \nThat is now finished , and as a result our operation will end , '' he said . \nWestern military powers have already begun winding down the Libyan mission , and diplomats have said the majority of NATO equipment , including fighter jets , has already been withdrawn . \nA NATO statement on Tuesday said operations in the interim would involve intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance missions , although NATO would retain the capability to conduct air strikes if they were needed . \nThe one remaining element from the old order is Gaddafi 's sons , the enigmatic Saif al-Islam , who remains on the run . \nOnce viewed as a moderate reformer , he vowed to help his father crush his enemies once the revolt began . \nAn NTC official said Saif al-Islam was in the southern desert near Niger and Algeria and was set to flee Libya using a false passport . \n-LRB- Reporting by Taha Zargoun in Sirte , Barry Malone and Jessica Donati in Tripoli , Rania El Gamal and Tim Gaynor in Misrata , Christian Lowe , Jon Hemming and Andrew Hammond in Tunis , Hamid Ould Ahmed in Algiers , Samia Nakhoul in Dubai , Abdoulaye Massalaatchi in Niamey , Matt Falloon in London , Souhail Karam in Rabat ; Writing by Jon Hemming ; Editing by David Stamp and Ralph Gowling -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWhen they got married they got a certain amount of money . \nSo they were rather the envy of many other citizens of African countries . \nNow , of course , since NATO s humanitarian intervention the infrastructure of their country has been bombed back to the Stone Age . \nThey will not have the same quality of life . \nWomen probably will not have the same degree of emancipation under any new transitional government . \nThe national wealth is probably going to be siphoned off by Western corporations . \nPerhaps the standard of living in Libya might have been slightly higher than it perhaps is now in America and the UK with the recession , she said . \nWhat really was the UN&NATO trying to achieve ?

{"txt": "Aug. 2 : Plaquemines Parish president Billy Nungesser , left , holds up a jar of oil collected from St. Mary 's Point in Barataria Bay on Saturday while speaking in front of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal at a press conference held to address the reopening of commercial fishing areas along the Louisiana coast in Venice , La. . \nAP July 31 : Oil containment boom is laid out in Treasure Pass , in waters near Yscloskey , La. . \nAP Experts have said for some time that the oil spill in the Gulf is one of the greatest environmental disasters in history , and the government has grim new figures to confirm that fact . \nThe Obama administration said Monday that scientists now estimate nearly 5 million barrels of oil have leaked into the Gulf since the April 20 explosion that sunk the BP-run Deepwater Horizon offshore rig . \n`` Not all of this oil and gas flowed into the ocean , '' the administration said in its latest report on the disaster , noting that about 800,000 barrels of oil were captured before the well was capped in mid-July . \nThe latest figures still are enough to secure the BP spill 's status as the world 's worst accidental release of oil , topping Mexico 's 1979 spill at Ixtoc I , which leaked 3.3 million barrels of oil . \nBP still has yet to permanently plug the busted well . \nAfter insisting for months that a pair of costly relief wells were the only surefire way to kill the oil leak at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , BP officials said Monday they may be able to do it just with lines running from a ship to the blown-out well a mile below . \nAs crews planned testing to determine whether to proceed with a `` static kill '' to pump mud and perhaps cement down the throat of the well , BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said if it 's successful the relief wells may not be needed , after all , to do the same weeks later from the bottom . \nThe primary relief well , near completion , will still be finished and could be used simply to ensure the leak is plugged , Wells said . \n`` Even if we were to pump the cement from the top , we will still continue on with the relief well and confirm that the well is dead , '' he said . \nEither way , `` we want to end up with cement in the bottom of the hole . '' \nGovernment officials and company executives have long said the wells , which can cost about $ 100 million each , may be the only way to make certain the oil is contained to its vast undersea reservoir . \nThe company began drilling the primary , 18,000-foot relief well May 2 , 12 days after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and killed 11 workers , and a second backup well May 16 . \nThe first well is now only about 100 feet from the target , and Wells said it could reach it as early as Aug. 11 . \n`` Precisely what the relief wells will do remains to be seen given what we learn from the static kill , '' BP spokesman Daren Beaudo said . \n`` Ca n't predict it for certain . '' \nRetired Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the spill response , said Monday that the focus now is on making sure the static kill is successful . \nBut he cautioned that federal officials do n't see it as `` the end all , be all until we get the relief well done . '' \nOne of the biggest variables is whether the area called the annulus , which is between the inner piping and the outer casing , has sprung an oil leak . \nEngineers probably wo n't be able to answer that question until they drill in from the bottom , he said . \n`` Everyone would like to have this thing over as soon as possible , '' Allen said , adding : `` We do n't know the condition of the well until we start pushing mud into it . '' \nThe company 's statements Monday might signal that it is more concerned than it has acknowledged about debris found in the relief well after it was briefly capped as Tropical Storm Bonnie passed last week , said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University environmental sciences professor . \nPlus , trying to seal the well from the top gives BP two shots at ending the disaster , Overton said . \n`` Frankly , if they can shut it off from the top and it 's a good , permanent seal , I 'll take it , '' Overton said . \n`` A bird in the hand at this point is a good thing with this deal . '' \nBefore the effort can begin , engineers must probe the broken blowout preventer with an oil-like liquid to decide whether it can handle the static kill process . \nThey had hoped to begin the hours-long test Monday but delayed it until Tuesday after a small leak was discovered in the hydraulic control system . \nThe static kill is meant as a bit of insurance for the crews who have spent months fighting the oil spill . \nThe only thing keeping oil from blowing into the Gulf at the moment is the experimental cap , which has held for more than two weeks but was never meant to be permanent . \nBP and federal officials have managed to contain large parts of the spill through skimmers , oil-absorbant boom and chemical dispersants meant to break up the oil . \nFederal regulators have come under fire from critics who say that BP was allowed to use excessive amounts of the dispersants , but government officials counter that they have helped dramatically cut the use of the chemicals since late May . \nThe Environmental Protection Agency released a study Monday concluding that when mixed with oil , chemical dispersants used to break up the crude in the Gulf are no more toxic to aquatic life than oil alone .

{"txt": "BP oil spill may not be capped until Christmas , expert warns ` Everyone should be prepared for worst-case scenario ' , says the head of oil consultancy group Sunday 13 June 2010 22.11 BST Workers clean up the oil washed ashore in Alabama from the BP Deepwater Horizon spill . \nNansen Saleri , a Gulf drilling expert , said he hoped BP would meet its August timetable for capping the blown-out well , but made it clear success was not certain . \n`` I know it is a frightening assessment but everyone should be prepared for a worst-case scenario , and that could mean a Christmas timeframe , '' said Saleri , chief executive of the consultancy group Quantum Reservoir Impact . \n`` The probable outcome is much better but the technological challenges are enormous . '' \nThe futures of BP and of wildlife around the Gulf of Mexico are largely dependent on the rapid success of two `` relief '' wells that are being drilled in an attempt to halt anywhere between 20,000 and 40,000 barrels of oil a day that is flowing out of the stricken Macondo subsea hole . \nSaleri , who dealt personally with four blowouts during a career with Saudi Aramco and Chevron , said the BP fire and spill was the worst he had seen . \nHe believes it may cause more damage than the Ixtoc I blowout 30 years ago , which is regarded as the most damaging of its kind . \nBP faced renewed pressure to do more to contain the Gulf of Mexico spill as the US and Britain played down diplomatic tensions over the crisis . \nThe British foreign secretary , William Hague , said relations between the US and UK were `` outstanding at every level '' . \nHe said it was up to BP under pressure in the US to suspend its dividend to help pay for damage to decide on its payout to shareholders . \nDavid Cameron and Barack Obama talked at the weekend , when Cameron expressed his sadness at the `` human and environmental catastrophe '' . \nTony Hayward , the BP chief executive , will be grilled about the disaster in the US on Thursday when he appears before a special Senate hearing . \nOn Wednesday , Hayward and the BP chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , will meet the president at the White House to explain BP 's response . \nAccording to reports , Obama will tell the pair he wants BP to establish a special account to meet damage claims by individuals and businesses hurt by the spill . \nThe prospect of a lengthy timescale to cap the well reinforces the views of Carlos Morales , the head of exploration at Petr leos Mexicanos -LRB- Pemex -RRB- . \nThe company was the operator of the Ixtoc I well in 1979 , when 3.3 m gallons of oil spilled into the Gulf . \nIt took nearly 10 months to bring the blowout under control . \nMorales is now sharing technical information with BP in an attempt to help it block the Macondo leak . \nHe has warned it could take `` four to five months '' for a relief well to cap the spill . \nHurricanes also pose a problem . \nThe hurricane season in the Gulf began this month , and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted it will be `` active to very active '' , with up to 23 named storms and up to 14 hurricanes on the way . \nSaleri said a bad storm could `` really complicate '' the environmental impact of spilled oil and delay relief drilling by two weeks every time a hurricane strikes . \nBP is also aware that the relief wells could be as unstable as the original one . \nExperts admit no one can rule out another blowout such as the one that sent the original rig , Horizon Explorer , to the bottom of the ocean . \nThe British company has warned in a regulatory filing that a blowout on one of the relief wells could release a further 240,000 barrels of oil a day , although Hayward has since discounted the chances of this . \n`` The relief wells ultimately will be successful , '' he said . \nA version appeared on p19 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 14.00 BST on Tuesday 15 June 2010 Our selection of best buys Follow all the top stories of the day on Twitter with the Guardian 's world news team achrisafis : RT News : One of the #Algeria hostages is Irish .

'' \nMay 11\\/12 - Executives from BP , Transocean and Halliburton appear at congressional hearings in Washington . \nSenate Energy committee chairman Jeff Bingaman says that it appeared that the explosion on the rig was due to a `` cascade of errors , technical , human and regulatory . \nThe executives blame each other 's companies . \nMay 14 - Obama slams companies involved in the spill , criticizing them for a `` ridiculous spectacle '' of publicly trading blame over the accident in his sternest comments yet . \nMay 16 - BP succeeds in inserting a tube into the leaking well and capturing some oil and gas . \nMay 18 - The U.S. nearly doubles a no-fishing zone in waters affected by the oil , extending it to 19 percent of U.S. waters in the Gulf . \nMay 19 - The first heavy oil from the spill sloshes ashore in fragile Louisiana marshlands and part of the mess enters a powerful current that could carry it to Florida and beyond . \nMay 26 - A `` top kill '' maneuver starts involving pumping heavy fluids and other material into the well shaft to stifle the flow , then sealing it with cement . \nMay 28 - Obama tours the Louisiana Gulf coast on his second visit - `` I am the president and the buck stops with me , '' he said . \n-- BP CEO Tony Hayward flies over the Gulf . \nBP says that the cost of the disaster so far is $ 930 million . \nMay 29 - BP says the complex `` top kill '' maneuver to plug the well has failed , crushing hopes for a quick end to the largest oil spill in U.S. history already in its 40th day . \nMay 31 - The U.S. government and BP are warning that the blown-out oil well may not be stopped until August as the company prepares a new attempt to capture leaking crude . \nJune 1 - BP shares plunge 17 percent in London trading , wiping $ 23 billion off its market value , on news its latest attempt to plug the well has failed . \n-LRB- Reporting by Erwin Seba and Ros Krasny : Additional writing and editing by David Cutler , London Editorial Reference Unit -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe TV show `` Issues '' on Headline News channel is saying they will have the some revealing news regarding this pathetic oil spill tonight on the show . \nThey are truley pathetic . \nIt is almost as if they are trying to not fix it . \nWeeks ago I submitted suggestions on the BP site . \nThey asked for suggestion form the public , engineers , etc. . \nIt had to just be a publicity stunt . \nThet are still trying the same old failed attempts . \nMy second suggestion to them is still better than any they tried . \nTake a 16 inch or larger flexible pipe surrounded at the bottom 50 feet with several inflatable high pressure bags\\/balloons . \nHave the robots insert the pipe into the damaged well hole . \nThe pipe is open to help the pressure go up the pipe and not push the pipr out . \nWhen the pipe is inserted deep enough to cover the inflatable balloons , fill them with the proper viscosity fluid to withstand the atmospheric pressure . \nThis will fill the gap around the pipe and prevent oil from escaping . \nIf they can put all the junk and smaller pipes into the hole they can put this pipe in the hole as well . \nThe oil will flow into the pipe to the ships and barges waiting for the oil . \nThey should have and could have done this weeks ago . \nWhat are they thinking ? \nAnybody that uses a car to get from point A to point B shares the blame for the oil spill . \nBP would not be in this risky business if we had not created the demand for it . \nSo the spill is OUR problem , as many of us have recognized from the outset . \nEven those that do not drive still get their goods and services from those that do . \nBut before we get too far ahead with finger-pointing , we ought to first plug the well . \nSince conventional ideas have not worked , anybody s thoughts are as good as another s . \nNo idea is foolish , if it could somehow work . \nSo share your thoughts with the rests of us . \nWe re in this together . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-06-01__570.rsd.txt"}
{"txt": "The BBC 's Andy Gallacher explains BP 's new plan BP has delayed a key test on a newly installed well cap aimed at stopping the flow of oil in the Gulf of Mexico . \nBP and US Coast Guard officials said further analysis was needed before pressure testing could begin . \nIf it proves successful , the well will be kept `` shut in '' and the leak halted until relief wells plug it entirely . \nThe blown-out well has been spewing oil into Gulf waters since April . \nThe US administration has sent BP and other parties a new bill for the clean-up . \nThe administration says the latest bill is for $ 99.7 m -LRB- # 65.8 m -RRB- . \nThe oil giant has already fully paid the last three bills totalling $ 122.2 m -LRB- # 80.6 m -RRB- for costs related to response and clean-up of the spill , according to the Obama administration . \nThe test in the Gulf of Mexico , which was supposed to begin on Tuesday , will determine whether BP 's new cap can contain the oil . \nCoast Guard chief Admiral Thad Allen said the extra analysis would continue into Wednesday . \nThis latest move to stop the oil comes a day after the containment cap was placed on the leaking well . \nThe sealing cap system never before has been deployed at these depths or under these conditions '' Work on the permanent relief well solution continues . \nBP Vice-President Kent Wells said no promises could be made about whether the new cap would work . \n`` It 's not simple stuff . \nWhat we do n't want to do is speculate around it , '' he said . \nShutting in the well would provide a temporary solution to the leaking oil . \nBP is continuing work on the relief well that is expected permanently to stop the oil . \nIf the test goes as planned , it will mark the first time since the explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on 20 April that the leaking oil has been stopped . \nDuring the tests , BP will be monitoring the pressure of the oil in the well . \nHigh pressure will mean the oil has been contained inside the wellhead . \nBut if the tests showed there was low pressure , Mr Wells said , this might indicate that oil was leaking elsewhere in the well . \nHe added that if pressure was low the cap would not be kept shut and ships on the surface of the Gulf would continue collecting oil . \nNEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL In June , BP placed a cap , known as an LMRP cap , over the top of the Deepwater Horizon well so oil could be collected at the surface . \nHowever , this continued to leak oil and has now been replaced with a better fitting device . \nNEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL When engineers removed the LMRP cap on 10 July , oil began to freely flow from the top of the blowout preventer once more . \nHowever , the Q4000 containment system continued to take some oil to the surface . \nNEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL Engineers then bolted on a new capping stack onto the blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- . \nThis allowed them to conduct a series of tests to see if the flow of oil could be stopped using the newly installed equipment . \nNEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL During the test the three ram capping stack has been closed and all sub-sea containment systems collecting the oil temporarily suspended , effectively blocking the flow of oil from the well . \nNEW CAP FOR LEAKING OIL WELL Once the tests have been successfully completed , BP will resume collecting oil . \nThe Helix Producer ship was recently connected to the BOP to provide another collection route in addition to the Q4000 rig . \nBACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT The testing will involve closing three separate valves that tightly fit together , stopping the oil from entering the Gulf . \nBP expects no oil will be released from the well during the test process , but the company remains cautious . \n`` The sealing cap system never before has been deployed at these depths or under these conditions , and its efficiency and ability to contain the oil and gas can not be assured , '' it said in a statement . \nIf the cap is unable to take the pressure , a pipe will be connected to the cap to take oil to the ships . \nWhatever happens , the well will still need to be plugged , which BP says may not happen until mid-August . \nThe first of two relief wells has another 30ft -LRB- 9m -RRB- to drill before intercepting the leaking well , Mr Wells said . \nHe expects BP to complete the drilling by late July . \nBP will then attempt to plug the blown-out well with mud and cement . \nBy Monday , between 89m gallons -LRB- 337m litres -RRB- and 176m gallons of oil had leaked into the Gulf , according to government estimates . \nUS President Barack Obama has labeled the oil spill the country 's worst-ever environmental disaster . \nBP says it has spent $ 3.5 bn -LRB- # 2.3 bn -RRB- on the response effort so far . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

{"txt": "Fed Has Giant , and Opaque , Role in Financial Crisis Aid Wall Street analysts , congressional overseers and the media have parsed every detail of the Treasury Department 's financial rescue program -- $ 250 billion and counting . \nBut the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been lending vast sums of money to banks and other financial institutions in an effort to jump-start lending in a financial system that is in tatters . \nAs of last week , the Fed 's loans included $ 507 billion to banks , $ 50 billion to investment firms , $ 70 billion for money market mutual funds , and $ 266 billion to companies that use a form of short-term debt called commercial paper . \nIt is considering a new program that would make billions more available to prop up consumer lending : auto loans , credit cards and the like . \nIn lending these vast sums , the Fed is essentially substituting its own unlimited ability to supply cash for that of private markets , which are not functioning normally . \nThe central bank is even fulfilling some of the original goals of the Treasury Department 's $ 700 billion rescue program by allowing financial institutions to use securities that are difficult to sell as collateral for loans . \n`` The existing system of lending is broken , '' said David Shulman , a senior economist at the UCLA Anderson Forecast , which analyzes economic trends . \n`` The Fed is coming in to do that lending . \nThat 's why they call it the lender of last resort . '' \nBut unlike the Treasury 's rescue package , which has elaborate disclosure requirements and oversight mechanisms , the Fed lending is occurring quietly and at the discretion of its five governors , as well as top officials of the 12 regional Fed banks . \nTimothy F. Geithner , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Obama administration 's expected nominee for Treasury secretary , has been a leading architect of the new lending programs . \nFollowing a long-standing practice designed to protect investor and depositor confidence in the institutions it deals with , the Fed refuses to name the banks and other companies accessing the cash . \nIt has also declined to specify which assets institutions have pledged as collateral in exchange for loans , a decision that has drawn skeptical questioning from Capitol Hill and at least one lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act . \nFed officials argue that any disclosure along those lines would create a stigma for banks and others that need to borrow from the Fed , making the programs less effective at jump-starting lending . \n`` There 's a concern that if the name is put in the newspaper that such and such bank came to the Fed to borrow overnight for a good reason , that people might begin to worry : Is this bank credit-worthy ? '' \nFed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress last week . \n`` And that might create a stigma , a problem , and might cause banks to be unwilling to borrow . '' \nBernanke also said there is little chance taxpayers will lose money on most of that lending , because the central bank lends money only to institutions it views as sound and requires that the collateral borrowers put up be worth more than the amount of the loan . \nOutside experts generally agree that Bernanke has been prudent in his decision-making , but they note that Fed lending to support the purchase of Bear Stearns and the government takeover of American International Group entails greater risk than the central bank usually takes on . \nThe expansion in Fed lending has come in the form of numerous new programs to inject cash into the financial system , attempts to combat a crisis in which banks and other firms are hoarding it . \nTo enact those steps , the Fed has increased the size of its balance sheet and replaced the ultra-safe U.S. government bonds it normally keeps on its books with loans to banks and others . \nA year ago , the central bank had assets of $ 868 billion , of which about 90 percent was in Treasuries . \nLast week , it had assets of $ 2.2 trillion on its books , of which 22 percent was in Treasuries . \nMuch of the remainder represents the new lending to banks and other financial institutions . \nEven the weekly report that summarizes the Fed 's financial position has grown -- to eight pages from four pages a year ago .

'' \n2255 Lord Malloch Brown , the former UN deputy secretary general , tells the BBC that the rescue effort has been damaged by the loss of much of the UN team in Haiti , but that it is well-placed to recover quickly . \n`` Obviously any organization which so tragically has its leadership decapitated is in chaos for a bit . \nBut in fact the UN is much bigger in Port-au-Prince than it is in most places in the world because of the big peacekeeping operation there . \nThe UN is in a better place to regroup and recover than would be the case in many parts of the world where natural disasters strike and the UN has almost no presence . \nBut I think the really big factor here is the proximity to the US , which is able to project by far the most capable logistics operations in crises like this , '' he says . \n2237 US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says undocumented Haitians in the United States will be granted `` temporary protected status '' , which will allow those eligible to continue living and working there for the next 18 months . \nThere are an estimated 30,000 Haitians living illegally in the US . \nTPS is granted to foreigners who may not be able to return safely to their country because of a natural disaster , armed conflict or other reasons . \n2228 UK International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander tells the BBC those involved in the aid operation are working against the clock . \n`` We are acutely aware that at this stage in the crisis every hour matters - that 's why we have our British firefighters on the ground already , trying to save lives . \nWe 'll be working round the clock to make sure not just that we save lives , but we tend to the needs of those who have been left devastated by this terrible earthquake .

'' \n1738 The BBC World Service is broadcasting special programs in Haiti over the weekend in French , Spanish and English . \nThey can be heard on 11860 kHz -LRB- 25 MB -RRB- and 9410 kHz -LRB- 31 MB -RRB- . \nTwitter users can also follow bbccaribbean . \n1733 Paul Bertoni in Petionville e-mails : `` At around 10pm last night , a neighbor of a relative we went looking for asked us if we could help him get his 13-year-old son from under the rubble . \nHe pointed to a spot under the rubble and asked me if I could see the boy 's hand . \nThere were three little fingers in the middle of the concrete and the metal . \nI said I could n't help . '' \n1717 The UN 's Chief Humanitarian Aid Co-ordinator , John Holmes , says $ 360m -LRB- # 221m -RRB- has been pledged to help Haiti and that aid agencies are working hard to distribute supplies . \n`` People are passing many sleepless nights trying to get this aid there , '' he says . \n1707 The BBC 's Matt Frei in Port-au-Prince says : `` The streets are absolutely packed with people . \nEvery available space in the shade - and it is about 40C -LRB- 105F -RRB- in the sun - has got people living in it . \nEveryone else is basically on foot or on some form of transport trying to get out of town . '' \n1705 Interpol announces it is to send a team of victim-identification experts to Haiti on Monday to help the national authorities . \n1703 Barbara Gloudon writes in the Jamaica Observer : `` The first question was why ? \nWhy must the people of Haiti endure such pain , over and over again ? '' \n1701The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says : `` The only convoys going through the streets are full of Haitians in the back of pick-up trucks and lorries , carrying what little belongings they have left . \nMany are leaving because the water , food and medicine they so desperately need has not reached them yet . \nMuch of it is here , but is stuck at the airport . '' \n1654 The Pan-American Health Organization , the Americas arm of the World Health Organization , estimates the death toll may be as high as between 50,000 and 100,000 . \n`` It 's just a huge guess . \nI just want to be clear that we really do n't know , '' Dr Jon Kim Andrus , deputy director of the PAHO , tells a news conference , according to the Reuters news agency . \n`` We just do n't have the information . '' \n1643 The BBC 's Andy Gallagher at Port-au-Prince airport says : `` It is a very different scene from how it looks a couple of days ago . \nThere are people here from nations across the world but overwhelmingly it is the Americans that are here in force . \nThe search and rescue operations is well and truly underway . \nBut the picture on the ground may be very different . '' \n1635 Mr Ban says as many as 50 % of the buildings in worst-hit areas either damaged or destroyed . \n`` A high proportion of the 3 million people in the capital area are without access to food , water , shelter and electricity . \nWe are still in the search-and-rescue phase , and we are trying to save as many lives as possible . \nA major humanitarian effort is now well under way . \nAlthough this is inevitably slow and more difficult than any of us would wish . \nWe are mobilising all resources as fast as we possibly can , '' he adds . \n1630 UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon describes the search-and-rescue operation in Haiti as a `` monumental '' task . \nAs for sheltering the homeless survivors , he says the UN needs `` tents and more tents '' . \n1628 Canada 's Foreign Minister , Lawrence Cannon , says some 1,415 Canadians are missing in Haiti . \nFour are confirmed to have died . \nAbout 6,000 Canadian citizens live in Haiti , but Mr Cannon said earlier this week that only 700 were registered with the embassy in Port-au-Prince . \nThe Globe and Mail has information on some of the victims . \n1624 Roger Hilaire has posted pictures of the destruction in Pitchon Ville and Delmas on his Flickr account . \n1616 UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says it will launch a flash appeal for $ 550m -LRB- # 338m -RRB- later on Friday . \nHe says logistics are `` extremely difficult '' in Haiti , but that the international community 's response to the crisis has been `` generous and robust '' . \n`` We are gearing up rapidly and effectively , despite the challenging circumstances , '' he adds . \nMr Ban plans to visit Haiti `` very soon '' 1612 President Preval asked Mr Obama to pass on a message to the American people : `` From the bottom of my heart and on behalf of the Haitian people , thank you , thank you , thank you , '' he said , according to the White House . \n1611 US President Barack Obama has offered his Haitian counterpart , Rene Preval , his `` full support '' during a telephone conversation . \n1610 US Defense Secretary Robert Gates says the primary goal is to distribute aid as quickly as possible `` so that people do n't , in their desperation , turn to violence '' . \nHe says military planners have been reluctant to drop food and water packages from the air because it could lead to rioting . \nAt present , security is `` pretty good '' , he adds . \n1606 Dozens of US citizens are gathered at Port-au-Prince 's airport , waving their passports in the hope of being evacuated , according to the Associated Press . \n`` I do n't know how much longer we can stand , '' says Beatrice Aristide , waiting with her 19-month-old baby . \nUS citizens had to hold up their passports to gain entry to Port-au-Prince 's airport 1604 Adm Mike Mullen , the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , says the US will have up to 10,000 troops in Haiti by Monday . \n1602 Rear Adm Victor Guillery , the man overseeing the US Navy 's operations in Haiti , tells the BBC that the aircraft carrier , USS Carl Vinson , will effectively act as a `` sea base '' outside Port-au-Prince . \n`` Essentially , it allows for the staging of helicopters , supplies and to be responsive to the needs ashore . \nSo , while there is a tremendous amount of effort to complete a port survey and to open a port to allow a greater amount of supplies to come across the pier to the effort , initially much of the work will be done by air , '' he says . \n1553 Medecins Sans Frontieres says thousands of people are waiting in Haiti for surgical treatment . \nSpeaking from Brussels , MSF Operations Director Jerome Oberreit tells the BBC the charity has had to construct makeshift hospital outside the structures that we were using before the earthquake . \n`` This means that the way they can operate is extremely difficult . \nThey do n't have the infrastructure that they would have had ? \nThe priority is to be able to set up surgical facilities that can answer to the acute needs of this population , '' he says . \nExtra medical workers have had to come in overland , because Port-au-Prince 's airport is only accepting cargo planes , he adds . \n1541 The BBC 's Nick Davis , Port-au-Prince says : `` People have been hearing on their portable radios that the international community has pledged a great deal of aid and they can see the planes landing , but they can not get to it . \nThey can not get to the water , which is so vital as the days get hotter . \nSome people have gone three days without food or water . '' \n1537 Andre Berto , a Haitian-American professional boxer who represented Haiti at the 2004 Olympic Games , tells the BBC World Service he is still waiting to hear news about some of his family . \n`` It has been tough . \nEveryone 's in a frenzy trying to find their family . \nI have a charitable foundation in Port-au-Prince and we disperse supplies and food , but the building has been crushed . \nI have the biggest fight of my life coming up , but Haiti is my life . \nWe will continue trying to bring awareness to Haiti and let it be known that we are fighting to get this country where it needs to be , '' he says . \n1534 The BBC 's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says : `` Tonnes of aid may by heading towards Haiti but little seems to have reached those in need so far . \nAid co-ordinators here say there are now enough large items such as field hospitals and search and rescue teams , but there remains an urgent need for food , clean water , doctors , nurses , medical supplies and body bags . '' \n1531 Only a handful of stories have emerged so far of people being pulled alive from the rubble of buildings . \nRescue workers say that the first 48 hours are crucial for such rescue efforts . \nThe BBC has published an info-graphic showing how they go about their vital work . \n1528 UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says there has been an `` extraordinary '' response to the disaster from the British public . \n`` We are determined to make sure that the generosity of the British people is matched by the delivery of aid to the people of Haiti , '' he says . \n1525 A spokeswoman for the UN World Food Programme , Emilia Casella , rejects criticism from those watching the suffering in Haiti that the aid operation is too slow . \n`` Pictures can get out instantly , and so everybody can see and hear the pictures , and that 's important because the world needs to know . \nBut getting physically tonnes and tonnes of equipment , and food , and water is not as instant as Twitter or Skype or 24-hour television news , '' she says . \nA security guard warns people queueing for fuel in Port-au-Prince 1521 Former Cuban president Fidel Castro says Haiti 's extreme poverty is `` an embarrassment for our times , in a world in which most people still are victims of exploitation and abuse '' , according to the AFP news agency . \nIn an editorial published by official media , he says it is `` time for real and true solutions for this brother nation '' . \n1517 The Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm Mike Mullen , says the United States is sending extra troops and marines , a hospital ship , and more helicopters to Haiti in the coming days . \n1514 BBC science and technology reporter Jason Palmer has been looking at how technology and social networking sites have helped news about the earthquake spread around the world , despite the collapse of many communication systems . \n1509 UN spokesman Mark Cutts tells the BBC `` no-one should underestimate the difficulties of operating in a country like Haiti '' . \n`` Even at the best of times , it 's a difficult place to operate . \nIt 's going to be difficult , but we do have a lot of teams which have been mobilised - many of them are in the air , others are already on the ground and we are seeing this operation gear up very quickly . '' \nSolbrook tweets : `` I wish the media would stop calling it looting . \nIt 's people desperate for food and water not hifis and TVs . '' \n1503 US Defense Secretary Robert Gates tells a news conference in Washington that the relief effort in Haiti is the `` highest priority for US military assets in this hemisphere '' . \n1500 Brazilian General Jose Elito Siqueira Carvalho , a former head of UN peacekeepers in Haiti , tells the BBC World Service that co-ordination is vital due to the country 's lack of infrastructure . \n`` If you put materials there without order , this can cause more problems . \nAll 7,000 soldiers are working hard to support the people and it 's tough work . \nThey have to have the motivation to start again . \nThat 's the history of Haiti . \nAnd they are ready to re-start , '' he says . \n1454 Troy Livesay has posted pictures of rubble and make-shift hospitals in Port-au-Prince today on his Flickr account . \nBarbara Jones from Milton Keynes , UK emails : One of my family in the US has spoken to a member of my family in Haiti . \nShe got through by chance on the phone , we had all been trying . \nMy aunt and my cousins are OK - they are living in the street in Port-au-Prince so they wo n't get hurt by falling buildings . \nWe still do n't know about my mother . \n1443 Former US president Bill Clinton , the UN Special Envoy for Haiti , urges Americans to make donations to help provide basic supplies for Haitians affected by the earthquake . \n`` You 've got unprecedented numbers of the people roaming the streets at night with no place to sleep . \nThey have n't had any sleep in two days , they do n't have water , they do n't have food , '' he tells CNN . \n1437 Lt Cmdr Ron Flanders , a spokesman for the US 4th Fleet in Florida , tells the BBC that the USS Carl Vinson has arrived off Haiti and begun ferrying emergency aid ashore . \n`` We have sent two helicopters ashore into Port-au-Prince that were loaded with pallets of food and medical supplies . \nThose helicopters also contained the maritime commanders , '' he says . \nA young French citizen evacuated from Haiti arrives at an airport in Paris 1426 US journalist Andres Oppenheimer , writing in the Miami Herald , says a monitoring commission should formed right away to prevent aid `` being squandered in a country with a history of massive corruption '' . \n`` In a country where the state is so weak that it ca n't run virtually any public services and corruption is rampant , many fear that once the story fades from the headlines , the flow of international aid will diminish , and that much of what gets to Haiti will be stolen , '' he writes . \nA report last year by FRIDE , a Spain-based think tank , stated that `` foreign co-operation has contributed over $ 2.6 bn to Haiti since 1984 , with little to show for it '' , he adds . \n1413 Raymond Joseph , Haiti 's ambassador to the United States , tells the BBC World Service that he is still hearing reports about strong aftershocks in his country . \n`` I am from the south-west peninsular , from the city of Aux Cayes . \nThe aftershock was so strong in Aux Cayes that the only hospital in the city collapsed , '' he says . \nCharles Gomila , London , UK emails : I ca n't believe the most powerful nation in the world can not get aid to the people in Haiti quickly enough . \nNo excuses , just do it ! \n1404 Jan Egeland , the former UN emergency relief co-ordinator , tells the BBC he believes that the situation will improve in the next 24 hours when the US military arrives . \n`` The biggest logistical capacity on Earth is in the hands of the US military . \nThe military will come , and I think today and tomorrow you will see great logistical change - chains being established by them . \nAnd what is good to hear is that the US government and its military will work very closely with the UN , which is also working very closely with the Red Cross . '' \nOn the ground in Haiti with survivors as they desperately plead for help 1400 Ansel Herz , an American journalist in Port-au-Prince , tells the BBC there are children outside the UN compound who have not eaten in `` one , two or three days '' . \n`` I just talked to a young boy whose parents died as their house collapsed . \nHe 's out there searching , waiting for some kind of food and if anybody could give it to him . \nHe has no money , no resources to get any aid of any kind , and that 's just the case for so many children and families that are basically stranded out in Port-au-Prince . \nThere 's not a massive visible relief effort that I can see on the streets , '' he says . \n1352 Jimmy Felter , a film-maker based in the US and founder of the charity , Voice of Haiti , tells the BBC World Service that Haiti 's already poor infrastructure will hamper the rescue effort . \n`` Haiti was hanging on by a string before this - there was starvation before this , '' he says . \n`` There is no infrastructure there , so if you start trying to have an operation where everything starts pouring in it can cause much trouble and confusion . \nIt 's been too little , for too late , for too long . \nBut the spirit of the Haitian people can not be underestimated . \nI 'm not giving an optimistic outlook but I would never give up hope . '' \n1350 The UN World Food Programme earlier said its warehouses in Port-au-Prince had been looted , but this has now been denied . \n`` We do still have that 6,000 tonnes of food , '' WFP spokeswoman Caroline Hurford tells the BBC . \n`` Apparently there were unconfirmed reports of looting taking place , but once our teams got down to the dockside they were able to see that there was some mistake . '' \n1341 Penny Lawrence of the charity , Oxfam , tells the BBC that the breakdown in communications in Haiti is causing many problems on the ground . \n`` All of our systems rely on mobile phones , telephones , sat-phones , email , and the internet . \nAnd we are struggling very , very much without those . \nWe understand people are getting impatient , but I do think there are extraordinary levels of devastation , '' she says . \n1335 The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says : `` People are doing what they can to survive . \nEvery morning the first jobs of the day involve getting the very basics . \nLoaded with old plastic bottles or anything else that can hold water , they fill up where they can . \nSome from broken pipes from collapsed buildings , that still have a supply . '' \n1327 Olafor Rotsson , a spokesman for the Icelandic Volunteer rescue organization , tells the BBC power shortages and security concerns are slowing the search down at night . \n`` When people get tired , hungry , and thirsty - and maybe lose hope - it gets more difficult . \nUp to now all the locals have welcomed us and we have n't had any problems at all , but the UN says ` security stage three ' , which means you are not allowed to work in the night . '' \n1325 Susan Westwood , at an orphanage in Haiti , blogs : `` We need powdered formula , nappies , baby wipes , baby cereal , infant Tylenol -LRB- paracetamol suspension -RRB- , infant and children 's vitamins , and baby care items such as lotion , powder , baby shampoo . \nWe also hope to be able to assist the surrounding community with clothing , medical supplies , household items , hygiene items such as soap , toothbrushes , toothpaste , blankets and towels . '' \n1323 The Disasters Emergency Committee -LRB- DEC -RRB- in the UK says it has raised # 2m -LRB- $ 3.3 m -RRB- in the first 36 hours since launching its appeal for Haiti - Queen Elizabeth II is among those to have made a donation . \n1313 The New York Times has compiled an informative topographic map of Haiti highlighting the areas affected by the quake . \n1304 Daniel Sergile from Amsterdam e-mails : `` My cousin , Joel , was at work when his building collapsed . \nInitially he was reported to be safe , but it now appears that he is trapped under rubble . \nTwo other cousins have been found safe . \nPhone lines are still down but we are able to communicate via satellite internet . '' \n1257 Oxfam says ensuring access to clean water for survivors is `` probably the most immediate problem to resolve now '' . \n1249 Haiti 's sea , land and air entry points have all suffered damage in the quake - as well as government and aid agency buildings - which is hampering efforts to distribute aid . \nSinging in Haiti 's temporary camps 1231 A US Catholic charity is considering organising a mass airlift of orphaned children from Haiti , the Miami Herald reports . \n1227 Anne Wilkinson , in Ilkley , UK e-mails : `` I worked in Haiti for five years from 2001-2006 . \nThe latest news I have is that St Joseph 's in Petionville has been destroyed but all have been evacuated . \nTwo boys are seriously injured but have not been able to get medical attention . '' \n1224 CNN has posted a video of a woman rescued uninjured from rubble after being trapped for 50 hours . \n1219 The BBC 's Andy Gallagher in Port-au-Prince says the dead are being buried in mass graves . \n`` There 's no time now to identify the bodies . \nThat 's something Haitians are going to have to deal with for years and years to come .

'' \n1201 World Food Programme spokeswoman Emilia Casella says looting is `` not unusual '' in disaster situations and that aid distribution takes time . \n`` Getting physically tonnes and tonnes of equipments , of food and water is not as instant as Twitter or Skype or 24-hour satellite news , '' AFP quotes her as saying . \n1150 Anjali Kwatra of UK-based charity Action Aid , tells the BBC World Service : `` In the first 48 hours after a disaster , it is n't international aid that makes a difference - that usually comes in after two or three days . \nIt 's the local people who go in , who rescue people , who provide what food , water and shelter that they can . \nWhat we 're seeing in Haiti is that there is n't the ability to do that , because so many people have been affected . '' \n1146 A spokesman for UN peacekeepers in Haiti says people are `` slowly getting more angry and impatient '' with the lack of aid . \n`` We 're all aware that the situation is getting more tense as the poorest people who need so much are waiting for deliveries . \nI think tempers might be frayed , '' David Wimhurst tells the Associated Press . \n1141 The UN says 36 members of its staff in Haiti are confirmed to have died , while nearly 200 are still missing . \n1136 Prospery Raymond , a Christian Aid staff member in Haiti tweets : `` This morning I went to a pharmacy and asked for help and they gave me all their antibiotics , which I took to the hospital .

'' \nAmong those who came to check out the ideas was Buck Lee , chairman of the Santa Rosa Island Authority , which oversees Pensacola Beach . \n`` Whoever invents the magic dust is going to be a millionaire , '' Lee said , as he handled phone call after phone call from people concerned about the oil-covered beach . \nJeff Powell demonstrated a tar-ball rake . \nPowell 's Pensacola-based company , Ellis Trap and Cage Manufacturing , has long sold crab and bait-fish traps and sand flea rakes . \nThe oil spill has hit his company hard , so Powell said he came up with another idea -- a rake that traps tar balls and filters out the sand . \nIn about 30 minutes he raked his plot of sand and left a clean section . \nPeat moss is Canadian John Green 's answer . \nHe demonstrated Sphagsorb , a microbe-enhanced peat moss . \nThe product has worked in Canadian oil spills . \nTen pounds of the Sphagsorb collects about 40 pounds of oil and tar , he said , as he spread the stuff over his plot . \nHe glommed up a large wad of tar with his gloved hand to show how it caused the tar to stick together and made it easier to remove . \nOther ideas included spraying microbes onto the sand with containers that looked like bug sprayers , and mesh matting that could be removed from the sand after the tar washes on shore . \nAfter an hour , the small section of beach in front of the public walkway where the inventors demonstrated their ideas looked much cleaner than when they started . \nBut evaluators were mum about whether they would choose any of the ideas or how quickly the public might see them in action .

{"txt": "Federal officials say they plan to investigate every possible cause of last week 's massive explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico -- including the possibility of criminal acts or negligence . \nIn the aftermath of the blast , an uncapped underwater oil well continues to leak an estimated 200,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf every day -- creating a monstrous oil slick that made landfall in Louisiana 's wetlands Thursday night and could become the nation 's worst environmental disaster in decades . \nPresident Obama said Friday that his administration is doing `` everything possible '' to respond to the explosion of the BP PLC-operated rig . \nA top adviser to Obama -- who last month lifted a drilling moratorium for many offshore areas , including the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico -- said no new drilling will be authorized until the cause of the explosion , which killed 11 people , is determined . \n \ncorrosion and structural leaks in the well \nThe Department of Homeland Security and the Department of the Interior are conducting a joint investigation into the explosion . \n`` Investigations are ongoing and everything will be examined , '' a DOI official told FoxNews.com in an e-mail Friday when asked if any evidence points to acts of criminality or negligence . \n`` It 's obviously too early to know . '' \nSalazar has ordered immediate inspections of all 30 deep-water drilling rigs and 47 platforms in the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` This operation is underway and will be targeted inspections ensuring that -LRB- blowout preventer -RRB- tests have been completed and those records are available for inspection , '' the e-mail continued . \n`` We are also verifying that emergency well control exercises are taking place . \n-LRB- U.S. Minerals Management Services -RRB- inspectors should complete these inspections within seven days . \nOnce drilling rig inspections are complete , we will start immediately on inspecting all deep-water production platforms . '' \nAlong with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson , Salazar was traveling to the Gulf Coast on Friday to inspect ongoing operations and to evaluate the environmental impact of the April 20 explosion . \nThe officials will conduct an aerial tour of the affected area and meet with federal , state and local officials leading the response effort . \nDHS officials declined to comment on the cause of the blast and referred to DOI 's statement . \nBut Elmer Danenberger , who retired in January as the head of offshore regulatory affairs for the U.S. Minerals Management Service , said the investigation into one of the biggest oil spills in U.S. history will center around what happened just before the blast , as workers finished pumping cement between the well pipe and a hole bored into the ocean floor . \nThe process is intended to prevent oil and natural gas from escaping , he said . \n`` That 's what -LRB- investigators -RRB- said the operation was just prior to the blast , '' Danenberger said . \n`` Now , how much prior we do n't know . \nInvestigators will be all over those issues . '' \nDanenberger said it appears `` to be the consensus '' among drilling experts that a poor cementing job probably led to the blowout -- when oil and natural gas exit a well with extreme force . \n`` They 're going to be focusing on the root cause , how the oil and gas were able to enter the -LRB- well -RRB- that should 've been secured , '' he said . \n`` That will be the primary focus , how the influx got in to the -LRB- well -RRB- . '' \nCementing operations could benefit from additional inspection standards , Danenberger said , adding that cementing incidents remain too common . \nAccording to a 2007 study by three U.S. Minerals Management Service officials , cementing was a factor in 18 of 39 well blowouts in the Gulf during a 14-year period , making it the single largest factor , the Wall Street Journal reported . \nEquipment failure and pipe failure were the next leading factors . \n`` There has been a history of gas influxes during cementing operations , so that is an area of concern , but nothing is confirmed , '' Danenberger said . \n`` But perhaps additional standards are necessary for cementing operations . '' \nMeanwhile , critics of British Petroleum say that cost-cutting measures by the London-based oil giant helped to contribute to the rig explosion . \nTom Bower , author of the 2009 book `` The Squeeze , Oil , Money and Greed in the 21st Century , '' told Fox News that British Petroleum 's economizing led to a lack of engineers , an overdependence on outsourcing and a lack of supervisors to keep an eye on subcontractors . \nTransocean Ltd. , which operated the rig on lease from BP , has said Halliburton Co. had finished cementing the 18,000-foot well shortly before the explosion . \nBP has said while it assumes responsibility for the incident , the company is still waiting for an investigation to show Transocean 's role in the matter . \nIn a statement released late Thursday , BP Group Chief Executive Tony Hayward said the company was increasing cleaning efforts along the shorelines of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \nIn addition to 180,000 feet of boom already in the coastal waters , an additional 300,000 feet is staged or in the process of being deployed . \n`` We are doing absolutely everything in our power to eliminate the source of the leak and contain the environmental impact of the spill , '' Heyward 's statement read . \n`` We are determined to fight this spill on all fronts , in the deep waters of the Gulf , in the shallow waters and , should it be necessary , on the shore . '' \nIn a statement released Friday , Halliburton confirmed it performed a variety of services on the rig and had four employees stationed there at the time of the accident . \n`` Halliburton had completed the cementing of the final production casing string in accordance with the well design approximately 20 hours prior to the incident , '' the statement read . \n`` The cement slurry design was consistent with that utilized in other similar applications .

{"txt": "A declaration of war on this medieval royal prerogative Clare Short 's bill would bring conflict law in line with the modern world Tuesday 23 August 2005 00.08 BST From the strictly formal point of view , writes AJP Taylor in his Oxford History of England 1914-45 , Britain 's entry into the first world war was declared `` as though King George V still possessed undiminished the prerogatives of Henry VIII '' . \nA characteristically arresting thought . \nBut this is just the start . \n`` At 10.30 pm on August 4 1914 , '' Taylor continues , `` the king held a privy council at Buckingham Palace which was attended only by one minister and two court officials ... The cabinet played no part once it had resolved to defend the neutrality of Belgium ... Nor did the cabinet authorise the declaration of war . \n \n\u2122 The question is , do you take that one step further and get rid of the medieval royal prerogative . \nNor was this the end of the prerogative powers . \nThe governments and parliaments of Britain 's dominions were not consulted either . \nEach governor general proclaimed the war on his own authority - except in Canada , whose parliament , alone in the empire , voted its approval . \nOver 300 million African and Asian people across the globe were thus involved , without any consultation , `` in a war of which they understood nothing against an enemy who was also unknown to them '' , as Taylor puts it . \nThe past is another country . \nThey do things differently there . \nExcept , actually , they do n't . \nToday it may be impossible to imagine many things about the first world war occurring in anything like the same manner . \nThe suffering of the western front would not have lasted for a week in the age of the mobile phone or the human-rights lawyer , for example . \nBut the prerogative power to take the nation to war , central to the process of August 1914 , is still there almost unamended , as though nothing has changed since the late middle ages . \nThere is , of course , something of an exaggeration in this description . \nThe royal prerogative powers , already formal in 1914 , are even more formal today . \nDemocratic politics , at least as much as human-rights law , has transformed the political context not just of a decision to go to war but of all the residual prerogative powers . \nIn practice the government exercises these powers on the crown 's behalf . \nAnd in practice it will only do so if parliament does not object . \nNevertheless almost none of this is written down . \nIn principle , if not in practice , a prime minister could take the nation to war in defiance of a parliamentary vote ; he wields a theoretical power that a believer in the divine right of kings would have recognized . \nThroughout the 20th century these powers remained mostly uncontroversial and unchallenged . \nYet they persisted as the basis for war-making . \nIn September 1939 the declaration was reported by Neville Chamberlain to parliament as an accomplished fact . \nMPs did get the chance to vote on substantive motions on the Korean war in 1950 and the Gulf war in 1991 , but only after troops had been deployed and hostilities had begun . \nThe Iraq war in 2003 broke new constitutional ground in many ways , in particular because a British government for the first time allowed MPs a substantive vote on a war before it began . \nThis was in one sense a tactical response to governmental weakness , an implicit recognition that domestic politics required Tony Blair to obtain the authority of parliament for an exceptionally divisive conflict . \nBut it was also a response to a growing sense among constitutional reformers that the government 's exercise of this most powerful of prerogatives was now under greater question . \nThree months before the war , Blair debated this issue with the Commons liaison committee . \nHe agreed with the MPs that it would be right for parliament , and good for government , for there to be a vote . \n`` There is a right to vote , '' he even told the committee , before entering a caveat . \n`` The question is , do you take that one step further and get rid of the royal prerogative . \nI do not see any reason to change it , but I do really think that in the end it is more theoretical than real , this issue . '' \nIn practice , Blair said , `` I can not think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament . '' \nArguably this was always the case . \nYet it is important to recognize that the nature of modern warfare has significantly increased the realism of Blair 's statement . \nIt is difficult to foresee the kind of total existential threat to the nation that British governments believed they faced in 1805 , 1914 or 1939 . \nThe wars that Britain is likely to fight in the 21st century are likely to be fought exclusively by professional forces , as part of an alliance , in the name of the international order rather than exclusively national interest , with real-time media coverage on both sides of the frontline , and in circumstances that cause minimal or no disruption at all to everyday life at home . \nThe longevity and adaptability of this country 's old war-making rules have been truly extraordinary . \nBut modern wars fought in modern democratic societies are increasingly posing new questions and demanding new rules , as the historic parliamentary vote in March 2003 over Iraq implied . \nThis is not to advocate change for change 's sake but to recognize that war-making in modern , rights-based societies requires new forms of legitimacy . \nWhich is one of several reasons why Clare Short 's private member 's bill requiring parliamentary approval for military action is both so interesting and so important . \nShort 's bill requires governments to do what the Blair government did voluntarily in 2003 . \nBut by explicitly removing war-making from prerogative powers and vesting that power in parliament , the bill goes significantly further . \nThe bill requires a government to set out a written political and legal justification of armed action . \nIf parliament does not approve , troops must not be committed . \nWhile allowing governments to embark on armed conflict in emergencies , the bill also gives MPs retrospective powers over emergency deployments . \nShort 's sponsorship will inspire some and provoke others . \nBut it would be petty to see the bill as an excuse to rerun old arguments about Iraq . \nFor this is , in the best sense , a modernizing measure . \nIt seeks to bring both the law of war and the system of public accountability for war-making abreast of modern realities . \nIt puts parliament in charge of the most important decision that any nation can ever take . \nFlaws the bill may have , but they can be ironed out in committee . \nThe bill 's second-reading vote in October will be a defining moment for all MPs who claim to be modernisers . \nAlready many big names in all parties have given their support . \nNot the least of those MPs was the late Robin Cook . \nIf all those tributes to Cook mean anything at all then the vote on October 21 will be a chance to turn those words into something lasting and practical in his memory .

{"txt": "By Lina Sinjab BBC News , Damascus Women have been involved in the uprising in Syria since its very beginning Maya , a Syrian activist who uses a pseudonym , was arrested at her first demonstration at the start of the protests against President Bashar al-Assad . \nShe was filming a group of Syrian women who had agreed to hold a silent protest at one of the busiest markets in the capital , Damascus , in support of pro-democracy demonstrators in the southern city of Deraa . \n`` This scene shocked people in the market , '' Maya says . \n`` As soon as we reached the central square , security forces arrested the young amongst us . '' \nMaya 's experience in prison helped her break through the barrier of fear . \nSince that day , she has become involved on a daily basis in the uprising . \nBut she is now concerned about being arrested and has gone into hiding . \n`` I had to run one day from them and hide under a car in a car park . \nToday , I have a year of work as an activist against the regime and if they get me , it wo n't be easy , '' she explains . \nMaya 's mother was detained for a week by the security services and interrogated repeatedly . \nShe was used as a tool to get her daughter . \nNow , Maya and her mother can only see each other in secret . \nMaya has long been involved in defending women 's rights in Syria , but she says her primary goal now is `` freedom '' . \nMany women and children have killed by security forces in the crackdown on dissent `` When you are under heavy gunfire , women 's rights are considered luxury . '' \nAlmost everyone you ask among the opposition says Syria 's uprising started in reaction to what happened in Deraa last March . \nLocals took to the streets after 14 children were arrested and tortured for writing on the walls of their schools the slogan of the popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt : `` The people want the downfall of the regime . '' \nThey wrote the graffiti because their school teacher was arrested for expressing her wish that the revolution would start in Syria . \nSince day one , women have been behind the dissemination of news about the protests in Syria and the state 's crackdown on them . \nRazan Zaitouneh , a human rights lawyer , has been among the main sources of such information . \nHer network of lawyers and human rights activists on the ground are telling the world what is happening in Syria . \nMs Zaitouneh , along with many other activists , formed an opposition network that is now called the Local Co-ordination Committees -LRB- LCC -RRB- . \nShe is now in hiding in Syria , having been accused of being a foreign agent . \nIn the search for her , security forces detained her husband and brother-in-law for weeks . \nWomen have also sought to challenge critics of the uprising , who have said it is dominated by conservative Islamists and is sectarian in nature . \nIn the suburbs , where women used to stay at home ... -LRB- they now -RRB- get out of their houses and speak out loud '' End Quote Rana Opposition activist Many have pointed to video and pictures of anti-government protests across the country , at which the faces of the majority of women are covered . \nActivists say this is not because the women are conservative Sunni Muslims , but because they need to hide their faces out of fear of arrest . \n`` Women from all parts of society are involved in the protest movement - Christians and Muslims , liberals and conservatives , '' says Rana , a 25-year-old secular Muslim who has been active in the protest movement along with her husband since the start of the uprising . \nRana points to an example from Harasta , a suburb of Damascus , where women ignored the belief held by many conservatives that they should not sing in public and chanted : `` A woman 's voice is a revolution and a man 's silence is a sin . '' \nThe women wanted to encourage more men to protest , Rana says . \n`` I am not that involved with women-specific groups , '' she adds . \n`` We work hand-in-hand , men and women , not only in organising , but also influencing the slogans that are coming out and always trying to criticise any violent actions . \n`` We also work in providing humanitarian aid to affected families . '' \nRana 's liberal background allows her social freedom . \nStill , she says , women who are in conservative areas have proven to be strong and influential . \nConservative Muslim women have defied social norms and taken to the streets `` When I go to affected areas where there has been a heavy crackdown by the regime , I see another layer of the revolution , '' she says . \n`` In the suburbs , where women used to stay at home , there is a social revolution on going . \nWomen get out of their houses and speak out loud .

'' \nSome of Gadhafi 's thugs posed as anti-government protesters and told men on the street to join them , he said . \nA protester I interviewed earlier confirmed that , saying they were spreading rumors that Gadhafi had left the country . \nA Libyan man from Dubai said he could n't reach his hotel that same night because it was blockaded by military closing in on around 100 anti-regime protesters who set trash cans and photos of Gadhafi on fire . \nHe heard machine-gun fire and saw three government land cruisers drive by . \nTwo of the three cars were filled with African mercenaries , and the third seemed to be Eastern Europeans , he said . \nAll the men carried AK-47s , he said . \nSaleh , a Libyan-American working in Tripoli , took part in the protests at the Green Square . \nHe was attacked by Gadhafi 's militia and fled the scene . \n`` I ended up having to hide out in an alleyway all night because I could hear them searching for us , '' he said . \nOn the first night the protesters in the Green Square thought they were victorious because they had driven out some of Gadhafi 's thugs . \nThen the military showed up and started attacking protesters , who fled to different areas . \nSaleh and Tareq both confirm reports that help from Benghazi is on the way . \n`` We are united . \nThere is a plan , and the people of Libya are not giving up . '' \nAn American from Wisconsin overhears our conversation and expresses his support for the protesters , saying Gadhafi 's end is `` imminent .

'' \nBP 's Doug Suttles explains hitch The smaller containment dome would theoretically be less likely to get blocked by hydrates because it would contain less water . \nIt could be ready to deploy on Tuesday or Wednesday . \nTapping into the riser would be difficult , experts say . \nAnother solution might be to plug up the blow-out preventer at the well-head , which failed to cut the flow after the explosion on the rig last month , with a `` junk shot '' of rubber and another material , Mr Suttles said . \nMeanwhile , a relief well is being drilled - considered a more permanent solution to the leak - but that is weeks from completion .

{"txt": "BP gave investors a glimpse of its future Tuesday , one that will feature a new American chief executive , slimmed-down operations , and $ 32.2 billion or more in payments to clean up and compensate people affected by the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nIn announcing its second-quarter earnings , the London-based oil giant tried to walk a line between reassuring bankers and investors about its vast assets and financial strength , and avoiding the appearance of being a rich , powerful company insensitive to the plight of the Gulf Coast . \n`` We have much to do to make it right , '' BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said in a conference call with investment analysts Tuesday , referring to the spill . \nBut he added that BP 's directors are also `` determined to restore value to our shareholders . '' \nIn mapping out plans to pay for damage and cleanup , BP said it will sell $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion in assets over 18 months , shedding about 10 percent of its oil and natural gas output . \nThat should enable it to shrink its outstanding debt and reinstate dividends next year for shareholders while still covering payments to the massive escrow fund for spill damage claims . \n`` It 's still going to be the second-largest oil and gas producer among international oil companies , '' said Fadel Gheit , oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. `` Smaller than Exxon Mobil but bigger than Royal Dutch Shell . '' \nIn a sign of how difficult it will be for BP to turn the page on the crisis , however , Rep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- \nlashed out Tuesday at the company for concealing its estimates of the rate at which oil had flowed into the gulf . \nMarkey released a letter from BP Chief Operating Officer Douglas Suttles to the Coast Guard in early July in which Suttles estimated that oil was pouring forth at a rate of 53,000 barrels -LRB- 2.23 million gallons -RRB- a day . \nThe BP briefing for investment analysts was a somber one , as Svanberg announced that the board had picked Robert Dudley , a BP managing director and former Amoco executive , to replace chief executive Tony Hayward , a British geologist who had spent his entire career with BP . \nDudley , 54 , who grew up in Mississippi and spent summers boating with his family in the Gulf of Mexico , will become the first foreigner to lead the century-old company . \n`` Today is a very sad day for me , '' Hayward said . \n`` I love the company and everything it stands for . '' \nHe said , however , he realized that for BP `` to move forward , particularly in the United States , it should do so under new leadership . '' \nHayward 's compensation package includes a pension valued at about $ 17 million and a severance of $ 1.6 million , or a year 's salary . \nWithout costs from the spill , the company would have declared a profit of $ 5.6 billion for the second quarter . \nSpill charges turned that into a $ 17.2 billion loss . \nThe appointment of Dudley , who will take charge Oct. 1 , comes at a turning point in the calamity . \nAfter gushing for three months , the damaged oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has been capped for the past 12 days . \nKenneth Feinberg , the master for the $ 20 billion escrow fund , is taking over the task of scrutinizing and processing claims and proposing settlements . \nStill , Dudley 's task will be immense . \nCongress is set to raise liability limits for oil spills and to impose tougher regulations on offshore drilling . \nSome lawmakers want to prevent BP , the largest producer of oil and gas in the United States , from acquiring new federal leases . \nThe Justice Department is investigating criminal charges against the company , which could complicate its ability to do business with the federal government or bid for leases . \nAsked how BP would be viewed in five years , Dudley said in `` a perfect world '' people would realize that `` BP met its commitments to restore the Gulf Coast and as a result of that BP has restored its reputation '' and it would be allowed to grow its U.S. business . \nHe said , `` Five years from now , I hope that people look back and say that was a quite incredible response to a quite tragic accident . '' \nAlthough BP 's provision for claims and cleanup is unprecedented in size , some analysts questioned whether it is big enough . \nIf found to be `` grossly negligent '' in the way it was drilling the Macondo well that exploded on April 20 , BP could wind up paying an additional $ 12 billion in fines alone and nearly twice as much overall , said Gheit of Oppenheimer . \nBP 's chief financial officer , Byron Grote , said that in calculating the size of anticipated federal fines under the Clean Water Act , BP assumed that it was not guilty of negligence . \nBy doing so , it pegged its fines at $ 1,100 per barrel spilled . \nIf found negligent , BP would have to pay $ 4,300 a barrel . \nIt would also have to pay 100 percent of the fines , while Anadarko Petroleum and Mitsui , its partners in the lease , would not have to share the cost of the penalties . \nCritics in Congress decried the company 's failure to say precisely how much oil it thinks has spilled into the gulf . \nHayward said only that BP had used a number around the middle of published estimates , which most recently have been 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day . \nIn addition , BP 's financial statement reflected an offsetting tax benefit from lower earnings . \nBecause the reserve for claims is deducted from profit , BP will not pay $ 9.9 billion in taxes that it would have otherwise owed . \nBracing for unknown costs , BP also said that it would shrink its outstanding debt to $ 10 billion to $ 15 billion , from its current $ 23.2 billion . \nDudley assumed his new title with modesty . \nHe said he has the `` greatest respect '' for Hayward . \n`` I did not seek out this job , '' he said in a conference call with journalists . \n`` I was asked to step into these shoes . '' \nBut in Washington , some people were ready to bid good riddance to Hayward , who had aggravated public anger by saying he wanted his `` life back '' and by going sailing on his yacht on his return to England after weeks on the gulf coast and in Washington . \n`` While it 's now happy sailing for Tony Hayward , rough conditions will persist in the Gulf of Mexico for years to come because of his failed leadership , '' Markey said . \n`` The new leaders of BP will have an uphill climb to correct the legacy left by Hayward , indelibly inked by the disaster in the gulf .

{"txt": "Nov. 9 : BP performs a deep sand cleaning operation in Orange Beach , Ala. . \nAP ORANGE BEACH , Ala. -- What 's typically a beautiful , quiet stretch of beach in the fall now resembles a construction site . \nBulldozers and yellow dump trucks shake the ground ; a giant sifting machine spits clean sand out one end , tar balls out another . \nWith its Macondo well dead and few visitors on the coast during the offseason , BP has launched its biggest push yet to deep-clean the tourist beaches that were coated with crude during the worst of the Gulf oil spill . \nMachines are digging down into the sand to remove buried tar mats left from the Deepwater Horizon disaster . \nThe work is getting mixed reviews . \nMany are anxious to see the beaches cleaned as quickly as possible by whatever means are available . \nOthers say BP may be making matters worse by bringing heavy equipment onto beaches and spreading the petroleum stain . \nSome fear fresh environmental damage from the work itself , which can kill tiny creatures that live in the sand . \nEven BP acknowledges that fresh tar balls are still hitting the coast , meaning some of the work might be premature . \nStill , local officials have given the company a Jan. 1 deadline to be done . \nThe project began last month on Perdido Key at the Alabama-Florida line , and crews with sifting machines large and small are spreading out to the east and west . \nOn a sunny day in mid-November , ground zero is the wide stretch of sand between the Gulf 's crystal water and the Silver Beach condos in Orange Beach . \nThat 's where Sue Rose has her ground-floor unit , and she was happy to see heavy machinery loading sand into a boxlike sifter just outside her door . \nThe machine strains tons of dirty sand at a time through fine screens , and trucks then dump the cleaned sand back on to the beach . \nThe refuse is taken to landfills . \n`` It 's wonderful , '' said Rose , of Erlanger , Ky. `` Hopefully we 're going to get our clean beach back . '' \nA few miles away at Perdido Key , Fla. , longtime resident Terry Hanners has his doubts . \nHe sees what appears to be an ever-expanding oil stain on the beach and fears the once-white sand will remain its current brownish tint , which is close to the color of weak tea . \n`` They 're just spreading it , '' said Hanners . \n`` We have a stain that 's going to stay with us a while . '' \nAn April 20 rig explosion killed 11 workers and led to more than 200 million gallons of oil spewing from BP 's undersea well . \nSeven months later , BP has settled on a multi-pronged cleaning approach at the urging of local leaders who fear a collapse of the region 's tourist economy if all remnants of oil are n't gone from the beaches before tourists begin arriving in large numbers again next spring . \nThousands of workers roamed the coast with shovels and plastic bags all summer , picking up as much oil as they could as it washed in . \nThere was no way to get all of it , though , and waves and tidal action soon buried large patches of tar and crude on beaches . \nFaced with pressure to remove all the oil , BP sent assessment teams to beaches with augers to look for buried oil . \nSpots were marked and catalogued , and contractors worked with government officials on a plan for attacking the oil under the surface even as smaller amounts of oil continue to wash in . \nToday , machines resembling agricultural harvesters move slowly along the beach digging about 18 inches below the surface in search of buried oil . \nSand is lifted by a conveyor system and dumped onto screens ; clean sand is expelled from the contraption , called a Sand Shark , while rust-colored tar balls , broken shells and other trash collect in a bin . \nWorkers are using a much larger cleaning system called a Powerscreen to scrub broader areas of beach . \nDozers pile up sand , which a big machine with a bucket dumps into the sifter . \nCleaned sand is ejected by one belt while tar and other material goes another way . \nWorkers have dug down about 30 inches so far to find oil , and officials say the dozers can dig as deep as needed to get the worst of the oil deposits . \nDifferent , gentler cleaning methods will be used in more delicate areas like Mississippi 's coastal islands and the marshlands of Louisiana , the company says . \nBP spokesman Ray Melick says the major work should be done by mid-February , before the weather turns warm and visitors begin heading back . \nNatural processes should finish cleaning tourist areas once the big machines have dug up all the oil they can . \n`` I think we 'll get 99 percent of what 's out there . \nThere may be some little BB-sized tar balls that get left , but over time nature will take care of that on its own and it will just sort of dissolve back into the surface , '' he said . \nLooking to speed up nature , the company also is pumping salt water on to the beach in some areas in an attempt to rinse away the oil residue and speed up the bleaching process , he said . \nThe work has raised concern among environmentalists who fear the heavy machinery will kill creatures that live on the beach or cause erosion problems as the natural lay of the land is disturbed . \nMarine scientist George Crozier says the work is doing some damage , like killing small ghost crabs that live in the dry sand . \n`` Certainly there 's going to be a lot of impact , but I do n't know if it 's going to be significant impact , '' said Crozier , the longtime head of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab . \nHe favors letting the buried oil remain where it is : buried . \nTony Kennon is worried about a different type of impact -- the loss of tourist dollars if there 's another oil-stained season in Orange Beach , where he serves as mayor . \nPeople do n't like the idea of an oily beach , even if they ca n't see the pollution , he said , and a hurricane could easily expose buried oil deposits , creating a new wave of concern . \nBusiness was off about 50 percent this year because the spill scared away tourists , and Kennon says the town 's economy could n't take another blow like that . \nKennon has given BP a deadline of New Year 's Day to finish the deep-cleaning work on Orange Beach 's nine miles of coast . \n`` If they want me to sign off on it , it 's going to have to be white and squeaky clean , '' said Kennon . \n`` We sell ourselves on sugar-white beaches . \nIf we do n't have that at the end of all this , we need compensation .

{"txt": "Roberto Benigni is once again testing the boundaries of good taste . \nHaving found the funny side of the Holocaust in Life is Beautiful , his latest film sees him on a comic love quest through war-torn contemporary Iraq . \nJohn Hooper reports from Rome Wednesday 5 October 2005 17.14 BST Please , please laugh ... Critics have suggested that the sympathetic portrayal of US troops in The Tiger and the Snow is a craven appeal to the American box office The Oscar-winning Italian actor-director Roberto Benigni looks certain to stir a lively debate on whether you can mix comedy and carnage when his latest movie is released next week . \nThe Tiger and the Snow -LRB- La tigre e la Neve -RRB- is said to be the first full-length feature film to be set in post-invasion Iraq - and its climactic scene is a gag on the theme of suicide bombing . \nBut the mix of humor and horror failed to shock the Italian critics who got a first look at the movie this week . \nAnd that included critics writing for the conservative press which has hitherto been consistently hostile to the left-leaning Benigni . \n`` In the drama of a bombed and invaded Baghdad , weakened by 12 years of embargo , Benigni 's farce finds just the right element of contrast , '' wrote Il Giornale , the Milan daily owned by the family of Italy 's conservative prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi . \nBenigni 's latest film sees him back on the same delicate territory he trod eight years ago in Life is Beautiful , which was partly set in a Nazi concentration camp . \nThis time , he plays Attilio , a Rome university lecturer and poet madly , but forlornly , in love with a writer , Vittoria , played by his wife , Nicoletta Braschi . \nVittoria goes to Baghdad in 2003 to interview Iraq 's leading poet . \nAn Allied bombing raid puts the luckless Italian scribe into a coma and Attilio tricks his way into the war-torn country to bring her the medicines she needs but ca n't obtain in a Baghdad hospital . \nBlinded by passion to the risks he is courting , he dodges through minefields and crosses the desert by camel and motorbike . \nThe underlying message is the same as that of Life is Beautiful : love conquers all . \nA convinced left-winger , Benigni has been a persistent critic of Italy 's government . \nMr Berlusconi is a prime supporter of American policy in Iraq where the third-biggest contingent in the US-led coalition is made up of Italian troops . \nNot unnaturally , movie world observers had been expecting Benigni to come up with a pacifist film in which the Americans were the villains . \nBenigni insisted this week that The Tiger and the Snow was `` profoundly '' anti-war and , indeed , the Iraqi poet , Fuad , takes his own life in despair at the chaos brought by the US-led invasion . \nBut , Benigni told a press conference in Rome : `` In general , war films appeal to reason , to the head of the viewer . \nThis one points at the heart . \nThere is no ideology , but for that reason it is stronger . \nThe Tiger and the Snow does not takes sides overtly against the US-led invasion and , just as suprisingly perhaps , it shows the American military in a generally sympathetic light . \nOnly in one scene , depicting the search of a building , are American troops shown behaving roughly . \nWhen the movie 's hero appears at a checkpoint , apparently kitted out as a suicide bomber , they lower their guns on hearing he is a poet . \n`` I am not judging them '' , said Benigni . \n`` I know that they are often poor lads without work and without future . \nI feel pity for them . '' \nSeveral newspapers accused the actor-director of shying away from criticism of the Americans in the hope of repeating the US success of Life is Beautiful , which scooped three Oscars at the 1998 Academy awards . \nBut Benigni said it was not his job to sit in judgment . \nParadoxically , therefore , it could be Italy 's largely pacifist left that finds itself pondering whether to jeer or cheer . \n`` Unrealistic , silly , well-intentioned and opportunistic ? '' \nasked the critic of Italy 's most distinguished left-of-centre daily , La Repubblica . \nShe eventually concluded , however , that `` at a time of widespread , apocalyptic pessimism '' , The Tiger and the Snow sent a necessary message : `` Never lose hope , never give in to horror , never accept ruin , fight on , and be certain of making it in the end . '' \nIn case you were wondering about the film 's title , it is meant to convey the idea of two things that rarely come together - like war and laughter .

{"txt": "By Micah Zenko - Special to CNN In the Washington Post , columnist Anne Applebaum asks - though does not directly answer - the important question , What to do About Libya s Stalemate ? \nOne position that she entertains is the notion that a stalemate is tolerable , and that it might even work . \nA steady but relentless bombing campaign , generous humanitarian aid and training for the rebels , a bit of patience , and we re done with Gaddafi without too much fuss or boots on the ground . \nWestern -LRB- or certainly Arab League -RRB- political leaders might not discuss Libya often these days , but a stalemated civil war there is seriously problematic for five reasons : First , people are dying and the situation could worsen . \nBefore the civil war erupted , the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , estimated that 500 to 700 persons had been killed in February alone when Libyan security forces had fired live ammunition . \nSince then , deaths overwhelmingly committed by the regime have escalated though leveled off . \nA Libyan rebel spokesperson estimated two weeks ago that at least 15,000 people had been killed , but reports of civilian deaths at the hands of regime forces have all but disappeared . \nGiven the motivations for revenge among both sides , however , the lull in violence directed at civilians could be short lived . \nAs the UN s International Commission of Inquiry on Libya concluded in its report last week , The Commission reached the conclusion that crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by the Government forces of Libya , and did find some acts which would constitute war crimes by opposition forces . \nSecond , one-sixth of the Libyan population of six million has been displaced . \nApproximately 920,000 expatriate workers in Libya were forced to return to their home countries , with some 250,000 having since returned . \nSub-Saharan African workers have been targeted by rebel forces for arbitrary search and detention , as well as cruel and inhuman mistreatment . \nAs the International Commission of Inquiry report revealed : The most serious attacks on migrant workers appear to have been linked to a suspicion that such persons were mercenaries on the basis of their national origin or skin color . \nAccording to UNHCR , at least another 100,000 people are believed to be internally displaced , though few aid agencies have a good picture of the situation in the Nafusa Mountains . \nThird , humanitarian assistance is needed . \nApplebaum identifies generous humanitarian aid as one precondition for stalemate giving way to success . \nHowever , the international community has not been generous so far . \nThe UN issued its latest appeal for $ 407 million of critically needed humanitarian aid three weeks ago . \nAs of today , all of the UN aid agencies in Libya have received less than half of the required funding in the form of either actual cash or pledges . \nIn much of the eastern part of the country , the aid situation has stabilized and commercial markets are functioning . \nNevertheless , as a UNHCR spokesperson stated today : An aid crisis could be looming It is apparent that the combined impact of protracted conflict and sanctions are eroding the government s ability to effectively deliver assistance . \nFuel shortages are compounding the worsening humanitarian situation throughout the country . \nAt one gas station in Tripoli , the lines stretched over five miles . \nFourth , most children are not attending school . \nThe National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- refuses to reopen schools . \nEducation officials from the NTC have said that schools will only reopen once Gadhafi has fallen , the curriculum is rewritten , and teachers sympathetic to the regime have been purged . \nIn the meantime , the NTC has put children to work cleaning streets , working as traffic cops and dishing up army rations to rebel soldiers , according to Dawn newspaper . \nMeanwhile , the UN s International Commission of Inquiry reports that both government and opposition forces have used child soldiers in violation of international humanitarian law . \nFinally , history and vast amounts of academic research demonstrate that the political upheaval caused by sustained civil wars decreases almost all socio-economic indicators , makes the eruption of post-conflict violence -LRB- including genocide and mass atrocities -RRB- much more likely , and often produces violence for export . \nOn the latter point , some officials , such as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , believe that Libya could become a breeding ground for Al Qaeda . \nAs she testified before Congress in early March : Many of the Al Qaeda activists in Afghanistan and later in Iraq came from Libya and came from eastern Libya , which is now the so-called free area of Libya One of our biggest concerns is Libya descending into chaos and becoming a giant Somalia . \nThe possibility of Al Qaeda or its affiliates establishing a foothold in Libya has been overblown . \n-LRB- One of the NTC s unbelievably one-sided public opinion polls asked Does Al Qaeda play a role in the 17th February Revolution ? \nAllegedly , 94 percent of respondents said no. -RRB- Nevertheless , as the civil war stalemate persists , more and more young men learn the lethal tactics of warfare , forge ties with other fighters , and perhaps develop ambitions that can only be achieved through terrorism or violent goals beyond liberating Tripoli . \nThe views expressed in this article are solely those of Micah Zenko . \nFor more analysis of international affairs , visit CFR.org . \nThis piece was reprinted with the permission of CFR.org . \nThe reasons you listed are just common symptoms of civil war . \nYou could have just said : `` No civil war is tolerable '' . \nJune 8 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Reply There wo n't be a stalemate . \nDo n't you see what NATO is doing in Libya ? \nIt 's shelling the country day in and day out ! \nJet fighters and drones dash through the sky . \nAttack helicopters circle over Tripoli like annoying flies . \nThe western forces led by France and Britain want to oust Gaddafi . \nThe UN Resolution 1973 is no licence to kill him , however stubborn he is . \nAll these sorties are a cheap solution to resolve a conflict . \nThey might eventually lead to a military victory , yet spark moral disdain for France and Britain . \nJune 8 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Reply Gaddafi would have resolved this conflict within a couple of months and got rid of these barbaric idiots without NATO getting involved and killing thousands of innocent Libyan people , destroying their country and causing horrific trauma to innocent children for the rest of their lives , not to mention the horrific cancers and birth defects the radiation from thier bombs will cause from many years to come , Clinton , Obama , Sarkozy and Cameron

since these people are n't ready to listen to themselves . \nit 's all about power madness and kaddhafi is not a match . \nJune 9 , 2011 at 12:09 pm | Sorry , but I disagree overall . \nThe bottom line , is that the world is better off without Gaddafi around . \nThere is usually a price to pay for a long-term solution . \nAny civilian casualties are , obviously , tragic . \nHowever , I have been to LIbya twice . \nThis is a country that has been run in a mafia-like fashion for 40 + years . \nA very depressing place . \nPeople in that country had no chance at freedom or any real life with `` The Leader '' in power and hoarding the fruits of the country for himself . \nEverything comes with a price . \nMany US citizens died in our country 's original push for freedom as well . \nWhy should we not lend our support -LRB- which is minimal at the time -RRB- for these people in their quest ... ? \nJune 9 , 2011 at 1:30 pm | You are so completely wrong , I do n't even know where to begin ! \nYou seem to conveniently leave out the bit where Gaddafi mowing these people down with helicopter gunships while they were still unarmed protesters . \nWe all know who the REAL barbarian -LRB- not to mention sponsor of terrorism -RRB- is ! \nAnd where on EARTH did you get the RIDICULOUS idea that there is `` radiation from thier bombs '' ? \nDo you understand anything about radioactivity ? \nThe only bombs which leave behind radiation are NUKES . \nIf we dropped one of those , this would be all over now . \nThere is no residual radiation from the CONVENTIONAL weapons that are being used in Libya . \nYou are simply spreading ill-informed and ignorant propaganda ! \nJune 9 , 2011 at 2:12 pm | Why do n't we just allow another country to do the dirty work ? \nWhy does it always have to be us ?? June 9 , 2011 at 11:02 pm | East or West , Libya , same camel sh@@t . \nThey deserve what they get . \nThe East wanted NATO in , the West inTripoly wanted the Bengazi out . \nThe desert wind and sand will remedy all that . \nTime will sort all that out . \nThat mob has been behaving like that since these places were just deserts . \nOr , alqaeda may be in already for a new era . \nJune 10 , 2011 at 12:38 am | Okay so you can use depleted Uranium -LRB- which cuts through metal easier -RRB- and after the bombing is over its not toxic at all ? \nYou can just throw it away anywhere ? \nJune 13 , 2011 at 12:55 pm | With the name Nato which gather many countries to agree VIOLENCE to resolve a country 's conflict -LRB- or civil war -RRB- does not call civilization to me , because the destructions and refugees ' creation even more than before . \nwhen UN let NATO IN the mess will all come back to us to suffer , look at the chemicals and radiations all will go to the planet -LRB- already said this will be the outcome before the bombing in March -RRB- Also Qadafy is no good leader of course . \nBut UN solution can only cause more harm looking into a bigger picture please !!

civil war . \nJune 9 , 2011 at 11:32 am | Reply Peole keep complaining that the Nato mission in Libya is unjust and going too far but what people keep forgetting is that this civil war started simply because Moammar Ghadaffi decided to attack and kill peaceful demonstrators who were asking for social changes . \nGhadaffi stated from the get go that Al qaeda was invading his country and behind the unrest in Libya but if so , Al Aqeda in Libya sure did n't fire the first shot . \nNo , it was the Libyan military that fired the first shot and it was the Libyan military that started the civil unrest , the exodust and the humanitarian catastrophe and the bloodshed . \nRecently a Libyan government spokesman argues that the Libyan people are the ones who should be deciding Libya 's future and not Nato . \nAnd while I could n't agree with his statement more , I believe that is exactly what the Libyan people were trying to do at the getgo when the Libyan government started to attack and murder them . \nAnd while the politicians in Washington continue to criticize this administration 's involvement in Libya , I believe that it must be noted that the Libyan unrest may have been resolved a lvery ong time ago if only the right wing radicals in Washington would allow president Obama to do his job . \nAnd unfortunately , because of the widespread and ongoing criticism by the gop over US involvement in this UN mandated mission in Libya , president Obama had to prematurely scaleback our military involvement and give the lead way to Nato . \nAnd maybe its the division in Washington that is encouraging Moammar Ghadaffi to try to hold on to power believing at the end , the gop would help him prevail . \nThat is the Party of No , the republican enemy of our state . \nJust imagine if John Boehner and the hardline radicals in the gop knew about our mission to kill Bin Laden way in advance . \nPerhaps Bin Laden would still be alive today simply because John Boehner and the gop probably would have tipped he and the Pakistan government off . \nBut at the end , democracy prevailed and America prevailed because president Obama is the most articulate and the most intelligent commander in chief and president America ever had . \nJune 9 , 2011 at 11:55 am | Reply Another right-wing idiot here vomiting his ignorance on this web page . \nIt never ends !!!

'' \nHowever , Islamists are said to form only a small minority within the rebel forces , and there is not said to have been any disagreement with the opposition 's political leadership , which says it is secular . \nMr Hasidi , who spent several years in a training camp in Afghanistan , told a newspaper he does not support a Taliban-like state and is pursuing an `` inclusive ideology '' . \nHe said : `` Our view is starting to change of the US . \nIf we hated the Americans 100 per cent , today it is less than 50 per cent . \nThey have started to redeem themselves for their past mistakes by helping us to preserve the blood of our children . '' \nHe has also called on foreign governments to supply rebels in Libya with Stinger surface-to-air missiles . \nMr Qumu has described the Nato-led bombing in Libya as a `` blessing '' . \nDiplomatic cables from 2008 obtained by WikiLeaks , and initially revealed by The Daily Telegraph , identified Derna as a breeding ground for fighters for a number of causes , including Afghanistan and Iraq The cables quoted a local businessman saying : `` The unemployed , disfranchised young men of eastern Libya have nothing to lose and are therefore willing to sacrifice themselves for something greater than themselves by engaging in extremism in the name of religion .

'' \nThen during the same period a year ago , who can forget Jim Bunning of Kentucky , blocking a jobs bill that brought a very important highway construction project in Washington DC and surrounding arears to an abrut halt as workers were told to pack up and go home . \nAnd this defiant and selfish stance by Jim Bunning also put a hault to a very important unemployment and health insurance coverage for hundreds of thousands of unemployed and struggling Americans affected by this recession the GOP caused with their failed and misguided economic policies . \nAnd Mr. Bunning argument for his stance was because he felt that the president was inflating the national deficit while he and his party sarcastically stressed `` fiscal responsibility '' once more . \nThen when the president introduced the rail project slated for Florida , Florida 's governor turned down this project , arguing that he was concerned that federal funding may have exceeded the cost of the project . \nAnd in the process of rejecting this project , thousands of prospective American jobs got automatically canceled . \nYet , the GOP still keep asking sarcastically `` where are the jobs . '' \nThen remember the oil spill desaster ? \nWell , when president Obama took office and appropriated federal funds to aid American states afflicted by the recession , Louisiana governor Bobby Jindel said his state did n't need any aid . \nBut when small businesses were affected by the oil spill desaster desaster , Governor Jindel was the first to argue that federal aid was not forth coming and he and the GOP sternly criticized the president and accused the president of not holding BP responsible for compensation the victims in the gulf . \nBut when the president got BP to set up a 20 billion dollar fund to compensate the victims , Rep Joe Barton of Texas accused the president of `` a shake down '' of BP . \nAs they say , damn if you do , damn if you do n't . \nAnd when it comes to foreign affairs , the GOP has been against America too . \nFor example , when the president set a deadline in 2009 to bring our troops home from Iraq , the GOP argued that the president was sending the wrong message to the enemy , although the enemy is question never existed before our illegitimate invasion and destabilizing of Iraq . \nThe same is to be said of Afghanistan and today we are still suffering casualties in Afghanistan because that war was prolonged to begin the Iraqi war . \nAnd since the Libyan mission , many in congress have asked what is the mission in Libya and what is the end game in Libya ? \nHowever , my question to the critics is when is the end game in Iraq and Afghanistan and what is the mission there ? \nAnd where are the WMD 's ? \nFurthermore , let me add that while many in congress criticize the Obama administration for our involvement in Libya by asking what is the end game there , it was president Obama who had to decide the end game for both the Iraq and Afghan wars a decade later when he set a deadline to begin troop withdrawal and the president has kept to his promise as troop withdrawal from Iraq began a few months ago . \nRemember the crisis in Egypt ? \nYea , the GOP and the mainstream media argued that president Obama was n't doing enough to defuse that crisis although the president had publicly called on Hosni Mubarak repeatedly to work towards a speedy transion and democratic changes . \nAnd at the end of the day , while some in the GOP and mainstream media argued that president Obama was not doing enough to help thye people of Egypt , others like Newt Gingrich argued that president Obama was betraying a friend in Hosni Mubarak and supporting a terrorist group , the Muslim Brotherhood by calling on Hosni Mubarak to cater to the demonstrators ' demands . \nAnd at the onset of the Libyan crisis , the GOP and the mainstream media accused the president of dragging his feet and not coming to the aid of the Libyan people who they said were being slaughtered by Ghadaffi . \nBut when the president intervened with military intervention via a legal unilateral UN mandate , the same GOP and the mainstream media without a sense of moral integrity and common decency , deliberately flipped flopped on the issue and accused the president of rushing to war in Libya . \nNow they say that president Obama is not doing enough to defuse the crises in Yemen and Seria . \nYou 've got to be kidding right ? \nNo , I do n't deslike the Republicans in America but I deslike the fact that they are anti-America and their only wish seems to be wanting to see the president of the United States and the country fail because they have a problem with the color of the president 's skin . \nI 'm not for or against any political party in Washington , I 'm just for America . \nIts that plain and simple . \nIt 's either you 're for America or against America and so far , the GOP and the mainstream republican owned and operated media and press seem to be enemies of the state . \nJune 9 , 2011 at 2:54 pm | Reply June 9 , 2011 at 3:17 pm | Reply Excellent Joe , its totally relevant to the article , and truthful . \nJune 9 , 2011 at 3:28 pm | Reply June 9 , 2011 at 3:36 pm | Reply These right-wing nutjobs do come out of the woodwork like cockroaches in a suddenly lit room . \nHow they take up for NATO and President Obama . \nBack in WW2 , I wonder if Hitler and Mussolini had so many sympathizers in this country then like Obama does now . \nThis insane carnage in Libya needs to stop and NATO needs to butt out asap , but sadly enough , wo n't !!!

{"txt": "BP 's shares fall 13 % after plan to stop oil leak fails BP plans to use underwater robots to cut a damaged pipe and lower a cap Oil giant BP 's share price has closed down 13 % after falling at one stage to its lowest level in 15 months . \nThe sell-offs came as the firm 's so-called `` top kill '' bid failed to plug the massive spill from its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico . \nBP said later that it hoped to contain the spill `` within 24 hours '' by sealing the fractured pipe with a cap . \nMeanwhile , the US government said it would launch criminal and civil proceedings against BP . \nAn operation to cap the leak was launched on Tuesday using underwater robots . \nBP 's chief operating officer Doug Suttles said that `` if everything goes well '' , the capping process could contain the spill within a day . \nHowever , he warned that success was not guaranteed and asked people to `` remember this is being done in 5,000 feet of water , and very small issues take a long time to fix '' . \nAnd there remains fears the leak will now go on for at least another two months , until relief wells can be drilled . \nThe earlier top kill method that failed involved pumping mud into the well . \nBP said that the total bill for the clean-up already stood at $ 990m -LRB- # 684m -RRB- . \nThe shares sell-off was BP 's biggest one-day shares fall for 18 years , and wiped # 12bn off its stock market value . \nIt 's certainly not ludicrous to assume that the final cost for BP of this mess could wipe out at least an entire year 's profit '' End Quote Robert Peston BBC Business editor At its lowest point , the firm 's share price was nearly 17 % down on the day , but it recovered slightly by the close of trading . \nBBC Business editor Robert Peston said it was `` certainly not ludicrous to assume that the final cost for BP of this mess could wipe out at least an entire year 's profit '' . \nAnnouncing the criminal and civil investigations into the oil spill , US Attorney General Eric Holder said : `` We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who has violated the law . \n`` We will not rest until justice is done . '' \nUS President Barack Obama had earlier called the incident the worst oil spillage disaster in US history . \nHe also said his administration would prosecute over the oil spill if laws have been broken , and promised to change the law if necessary to prevent another such disaster . \nThe nearly $ 1bn clean-up cost to date includes $ 40m in economic injury claims , as well as grants to the authorities in the US states located in the Gulf area . \nHowever , the latest fall in BP 's shares suggests that markets now expect the ultimate cost to the company from the oil spill to be much more severe than this . \nBP 's share price closed on Friday at # 4.95 , but fell to # 4.12 after the markets reopened on Tuesday - after a Monday bank holiday - before closing at # 4.30 . \nBP 's legal liability in the US is currently limited by law to a mere $ 75m , although this is expected to be increased to $ 10bn . \nOil booms - partly successful Dispersant used - scientists warn it may kill marine life Huge dome placed over leak - became blocked by ice crystals Mile-long tube - fails to suck up large amount of oil `` Top-kill '' method to pump heavy mud - abandoned `` The markets are pricing in an apocalyptic scenario , '' said Evgeny Solovyov , equity analyst at SG Securities in London . \nHe added that BP owns only 65 % of the oil well , meaning its legal liability will be limited to just $ 6.5 bn - although it could go higher if BP were found guilty of gross negligence or a criminal act . \n`` The markets seem to assume that BP will have to withdraw from America , '' he added , noting that there was talk among government lawyers about barring the oil company from US government contracts . \nBP is also the biggest participant in deep sea drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , and therefore is likely to be hardest hit by the moratorium on this activity announced by President Barack Obama . \nThe sharp fall in BP 's share price is bad news for UK pension funds , which are major shareholders in the firm . \nThe oil company has claimed that it pays # 1 in every # 7 of dividends that the pension funds receive from FTSE 100 companies . \nAlthough the price change does not directly affect BP 's ability to pay dividends , it does indicate that markets are anticipating a significant cut . \nSome oil analysts have also speculated that if BP 's share price continues to fall , the company may find that it becomes an affordable takeover target for some of its global rivals . \nBP now hopes to cap the leak by using undersea robots to slice through the damaged pipe to make a clean cut that can be connected to another pipe , capturing the leaking oil . \nHowever , this strategy may not stop the oil spill completely . \nThat will only happen once BP has finished drilling two new relief wells - something that is not expected to be ready before August . \nThe White House said the president had been informed that the flow rate could increase by as much as 20 % until the containment device was applied over the leak . \nUniversity of Alabama engineering professor Philip W Johnson told Associated Press news agency that although he was hopeful the plan would succeed , if the new cap could not be placed on the fresh cut , `` things will get much worse '' . \nThe system is similar to a previous containment dome plan that failed . \nMeanwhile , the oil giant said it was stepping up its containment strategy . \nIt said that the total length of the boom - used to collect oil floating on the sea surface - would be almost doubled to 3.7 million ft. . \nBP also now plans to use hoses and other equipment deployed in the failed `` top kill '' strategy to siphon off more of the leaking oil . \n`` BP 's priority is to keep as much oil as we can from causing additional harm to the Gulf , the shoreline and the people of the region , '' said BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward on Monday . \n`` This planned multi-step containment strategy is our best option for achieving this as we work hard towards completing the relief wells that will kill this well completely .

{"txt": "Iraq Survey Group concludes dictator destroyed weapons years before invasion Thursday 13 January 2005 03.10 GMT The US investigators searching for Saddam Hussein 's alleged weapons of mass destruction have given up the hunt and left Iraq with an appeal to the Pentagon for the release of several Iraqi scientists still being questioned , it was reported yesterday . \nCharles Duelfer , who led the Iraq Survey Group , has returned to the US and will deliver a final report in the spring that will be almost identical to the interim assessment he delivered to Congress last October . \nLast night the White House press secretary said there no longer was an active search for weapons . \n`` A lot of their mission is focused elsewhere , '' said Scott McClellan . \n`` Charlie has left Iraq , '' an intelligence official said yesterday . \n`` In terms of the weapons hunt in a proactive sense , it has concluded , and the report is being tweaked a bit but it will be largely unchanged . '' \nBut he added : `` There is a considerable amount of document exploitation to be done that will continue to occur and leads that come out of the exploitation will be followed up . '' \nThe Washington Post said the ISG had made `` several pleas '' to the Pentagon to release the Iraqi scientists , who have been held for nearly two years and who have been interviewed extensively . \nThe scientists include General Amir al-Saadi , who negotiated with UN inspectors on behalf of the Saddam regime ; Rihab Taha , a biologist also known as Dr Germ ; her husband , Amir Rashid , a former oil minister ; and Huda Amash , a biologist nicknamed Mrs Anthrax by UN inspectors . \nGen Saadi 's German-born wife Helma told the Guardian last night that she had heard from US sources that Donald Rumsfeld , the US defense secretary , had approved her husband 's release some weeks after the October report was submitted . \nHe had checked with the Iraqi justice minister who said he had no objection . \n`` I understand the matter is with the prime minister , Ayad Allawi , now . \nI do n't know why it is taking so long , '' she said . \nBy chance , the Red Cross arranged yesterday for Gen Saadi to make a rare phone call to his wife . \n`` He did n't sound optimistic , '' she said . \n`` He said he 's kept in the dark . \nNo one tells him anything . \nHe asked for more books . '' \nLast night the White House press secretary , Scott McClellan , said there no longer was an active search for weapons . \n`` There may be a couple , a few people , that are focused on that , '' he said , `` but it has largely concluded . '' \nHe added : `` If they have any reports of -LRB- weapons of mass destruction -RRB- obviously they 'll continue to follow up on those reports . \n`` A lot of their mission is focused elsewhere now . '' \nHe said the final Duelfer report `` is not going to fundamentally alter '' the earlier findings , which said Saddam not only had no weapons of mass destruction and had not made any since 1991 , but that he had no capability of making any either . \nMany thousands of pages of Saddam-era documents are still being translated and analyzed , but most weapons experts believe they are unlikely to change the fundamental ISG assessment that the former regime had rid itself of weapons of mass destruction many years before the invasion . \nAfter Mr Duelfer 's presentation to Congress in October , a senior ISG official said he was only returning to Baghdad `` to tie up odds and ends '' , with no real expectation of further discoveries . \nUS officials said the operation was being wrapped up because there was little expectation of finding any substantial new evidence and the hunt could no longer be justified in view of the rising danger to the investigators . \nDespite the end of the search , President George Bush last night said he remained convinced that he was right to go to war on Saddam . \nIn an interview with ABC television 's Barbara Walters , Mr Bush admitted : `` I felt like we 'd find weapons of mass destruction , or like many many here in the United States , many around the world , the United Nations , thought he had weapons of mass destruction .

{"txt": "BEIRUT | Wed Oct 5 , 2011 7:49 pm EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkey said on Wednesday it would impose sanctions on Syria despite the blocking of any U.N. measures against President Bashar al-Assad for his crackdown on dissent . \nRussia and China handed Assad a diplomatic victory on Tuesday by vetoing a Western-backed U.N. resolution that could have led to U.N. sanctions on Damascus , but Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan promised action of his own . \n`` Naturally the veto ... can not prevent sanctions , '' Erdogan said . \n`` We will of necessity implement a package of sanctions . '' \nErdogan , who is visiting South Africa , has said he will announce the package after he visits a Syrian refugee camp in Turkey in the next few days . \nThe double veto by Moscow and Beijing infuriated Western powers which have already imposed their own sanctions on Syria and were trying to pave the way for a U.N. embargo , and will reinforce Assad 's hold on power -- at least in the short term . \n`` This is a sad day for the Syrian people . \nIt 's a sad day for the Security Council , '' France 's Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said . \nGermany also expressed disappointment . \nA government spokesman said the draft resolution would have been an important signal of support for many Syrians `` who for months have been taking to the streets for political freedom . '' \nSyria 's state news agency SANA said Damascus welcomed the veto . \n`` It restores hope for a balanced world ... after a long time of American and European domination which turned the Security Council 's resolutions into a tool for punishing defenders of independence and liberation , '' SANA said . \nThe draft resolution received nine votes in favor and four abstentions . \nU.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said Washington was outraged and called for `` tough targeted sanctions '' on Damascus . \nRussia 's ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Moscow rejected the threat of sanctions on Syria and China 's envoy Li Baodong said Beijing opposed `` interference in -LRB- Syria 's -RRB- internal affairs . '' \nRussia has close ties with Assad 's government , which has been a client for arms sales , and has a naval maintenance facility on Syria 's Mediterranean coast . \nBeijing and Moscow , which had voiced concern that the draft could pave the way for Libya-style military intervention , also want to limit Western influence in the Middle East , while the United States and Europe have long sought to loosen Syria 's alliance with Iran . \nAssad has used tanks and troops to crush an uprising which erupted in March , inspired by regional revolts which toppled three North African leaders this year . \nThe United Nations says 2,700 civilians have been killed . \nDamascus blames the violence on foreign-backed armed groups which it says have killed at least 700 security personnel . \nSyria 's economy is reeling from the impact of the unrest and U.S. and European sanctions on the small but key oil sector . \nAssad faces a more united opposition after groups in exile came together in Istanbul on Sunday to call for his downfall , but the U.N. vote marks a setback to his opponents who had hoped for an escalation in international pressure on Damascus . \n`` We deeply regret the positions of Russia and China toward the resolution , '' said Omar Idlibi of the grassroots Local Coordination Committee in Beirut , adding he had `` not lost hope in the international community . '' \nIdlibi said the opposition was studying options including a general strike or civil disobedience campaign , but analysts said Assad did not look threatened in the immediate future . \n`` The mere fact that Assad can avoid international sanctions for the time being reinforces his position in the short term , '' said Ayham Kamel from the Eurasia thinktank . \n`` Assad is going to remain in power in the near term . \nI do n't think there are signs of imminent collapse but Syria faces challenges across the country -- the economy , insecurity across the country , and a more organized opposition . '' \nSyria banned most imports last month to try and conserve dwindling foreign currency reserves , but rescinded the measure on Tuesday after a spike in prices and disquiet among an influential merchant class that has been backing Assad . \nTurkish sanctions could also have a major impact . \nBut Turkish officials have made clear that any measures will target Assad 's government and not the Syrian people . \nFor this reason Turkey has ruled out cutting off electricity sales or reducing the flow of water in the Euphrates river into Syria . \nBilateral trade between Turkey and Syria was worth $ 2.5 billion in 2010 , and Turkish firms had investments of $ 260 million in Syria One target of sanctions is likely to be Syria 's state banking system , which could effectively block purchases of Syrian crude oil . \nOther possible measures could freeze Turkish cooperation in oil and gas projects involving state-run firms . \nState television broadcast an interview on Wednesday with a young woman who denied reports by rights groups last month that she had been killed and mutilated , possibly in state custody . \nThe mother of Zainab al-Hosni , 18 , from the city of Homs , confirmed that the woman on television was her daughter , who was reported to have killed after disappearing in July , Human Rights Watch said . \n`` We spoke to the family and they were able to confirm that the person who appeared on TV was Zainab , '' said Nadim Houry of HRW in Beirut . \n`` The mother said she was her daughter . '' \nHosni became an icon for the Syrian revolt against Assad after the body of a badly burned , decapitated woman was found in a morgue by Hosni 's family , according to reports by HRW and Amnesty International . \nAfter months of peaceful protests , some army deserters and dissidents have taken up arms , prompting military operations against them , especially in areas bordering Turkey and Jordan . \nColonel Riad al-Asaad , a Syrian officer who defected and fled to Turkey , said last week 10,000 soldiers had deserted , but authorities have denied any army defections , saying the military operations were a response to appeals by residents . \nAssad retains control of the military , whose mostly Sunni Muslim rank and file are largely commanded by officers of his minority Alawite sect . \nSyria has mostly closed its doors to independent media , making it hard to verify events , but a trickle of desertions appears to have gathered pace in the last several weeks . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIn Syria Russia has military installations , so Syrian people that want democracy are killed by Syrian soldiers using Russian , T-64 , T-85 I suppose tanks . \nI SEE NO DIFFERENCE , if anybody is brilliant to perceive it please comment . \nWell in fact fate of Bahraini is far worse than Syrian , but it is a different story ...

{"txt": "Monday 9 May 2005 00.00 BST In June 1971 , Colonel David Hackworth , probably America 's most decorated soldier in Vietnam , appeared on ABC television and told his countrymen that the war could not be won , that US military leaders had failed to understand or train their men for the nature of the country or the conflict , that Saigon would fall to the communists within five years and that one of every five American casualties had been the victim of so-called friendly fire . \nThis criticism put Hackworth , who has died of cancer aged 73 , under concerted attack from his superiors , an assault made easier to sustain by the fast and loose approach to regulations he had employed as commander of a Blackhawk air cavalry brigade in Vietnam . \nHis troops wore US civil war hats , and Hackworth , as commander of the unit , later became the model for Colonel Kilgore , the abrasive , cigar-chomping officer played by Robert Duvall in the 1979 film Apocalypse Now . \nHackworth had set up his unit 's own bordello in Vietnam , and the US army used that and other violations to threaten him with court-martial . \nHowever , General Creighton Abrams , the overall commander in Vietnam , called him `` the best battalion commander I ever saw '' , and , in 1971 , he was allowed to resign with an honorable discharge . \nHe threw away his medals in protest , and moved to Australia . \nIn the 1980s , Hackworth returned to the US after his medals were reissued , and his book about Vietnam , About Face , became a best-seller . \nFrom 1990 to 1996 , he was a contributing editor on defense at Newsweek magazine , where , in 1996 , he wrote a column revealing that Admiral Michael Boorda , a former chief of US naval operations , wore combat medals he had not earned . \nWhen the admiral committed suicide , Hackworth again incurred the military 's wrath . \nHe was accused of lying when he claimed to be the army 's `` most-decorated soldier '' - the US keeps no statistics on such matters - and of wearing an unearned Ranger tab . \nAn army investigation found that Hackworth had been issued the tag in error , but had never been given a number of medals he had earned . \nHis decorations included two distinguished service crosses , the second highest US award for valor , 10 silver stars , eight bronze stars and eight purple hearts . \nAfter leaving Newsweek , Hackworth wrote a syndicated newspaper column , Defending America , with his third wife , Eilhys England . \nCovering both Iraq wars and peacekeeping actions in Somalia , the Balkans and Haiti , he became a fierce critic of the US establishment . \nHis website , Soldiers For Truth , lambasted the Pentagon 's `` perfumed princes '' , whom he claimed constantly betrayed the ordinary solider . \nHe was particularly incensed that Donald Rumsfeld used a machine to sign condolence letters sent to the families of dead soldiers in Iraq . \nHackworth 's army connections began young . \nOrphaned at five months , and raised by his grandmother in Santa Monica , California , he shined shoes at a local army base , becoming a mascot to the soldiers , who gave him his own uniform . \nAt 14 , he lied about his age and joined the US merchant marine ; a year later , he paid a sailor to impersonate his father and get him into the army , where he served in postwar Italy , policing the border dispute over Trieste . \nHe won his first silver Star in Korea at the age of 20 , when his battlefield commission made him the army 's youngest captain . \nCommanding the Wolfhound Raiders , he led one attack despite being shot in the head , modelling himself on General James Gavin , America 's youngest second world war general -LRB- played by Ryan O'Neal in the 1977 film , A Bridge Too Far -RRB- . \nHackworth volunteered for service with the US special forces in Vietnam , and , as the army 's youngest full colonel , returned in 1965 , commanding a paratroop unit . \nWith General SLA `` Slam '' Marshall , he wrote the Vietnam Primer , a guide to counter-guerrilla tactics . \nHe used his theories about the enemy , whom he referred to as `` the G '' , to transform a hapless 4\\/39 infantry unit into what became known as the Hardcore Battalion , driving his men so hard they allegedly put a cash bounty on him . \nBut he also won their loyalty , by such acts as leading the rescue of a trapped company while riding on the strut of a helicopter . \nIt was one of three times on which Hackworth was nominated for the congressional medal of honor , America 's highest award . \nAfter leaving the army , he was successful in property and restaurants in Brisbane , and became active in the Australian peace movement . \nHe returned to Greenwich , Connecticut , in the 1980s . \nHackworth 's many books included a novel , Price Of Honor , a volume of war dispatches , Hazardous Duty , and a memoir of the hardcore battalion , Steel My Soldier 's Hearts . \nServing soldiers fed his website with information about the army 's leadership shortcomings . \nLast February , he wrote , `` Most combat vets pick their fights carefully . \nThey look at their scars , remember the madness and are always mindful of the fallout ... the White House and the Pentagon are run by civilians who have never sweated it out on a battlefield . '' \nHackworth died in Tijuana , Mexico , while pursuing alternative treatments for bladder cancer , a common cause of death among soldiers exposed to the dioxins Agent Orange and Agent Blue , used to defoliate Vietnam . \nHe is survived by Eihlys and his stepdaughter , two daughters and a son from his first marriage , and a son from his second marriage . \nDavid Haskell Hackworth , soldier , born November 11 1931 ; died May 4 2005 Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/iraqwar_guardian/rsd/IraqWar_guardian__2005-05-09__229.rsd.txt"}

'' \nSarah is the East and Central Africa disaster management officer for Tearfund - a relief and development charity - which sent a team out to Haiti on 17 January . \nThe Red Cross estimates that up to 50,000 people were killed and three million people affected by the earthquake , which hit 7.0 on the Richter Scale . \nSarah was in Haiti on 20 January when an aftershock hit , measuring 6.1 on the Richter Scale . \n`` It was at 6am in the morning so most people were still asleep , '' Sarah said . \n`` We were sleeping in tents and it was pretty scary because it was our first night here . \n`` To get woken up , when you 're still asleep , it takes a couple of seconds to register what is happening . \n`` There was an awful lot of noise because people were screaming - we just tried to get out of our tents quick enough to be safe . \n`` Fortunately where we are staying , there are not many buildings around . \nWe were fairly safe . \nMany people live in poorly constructed houses on hills in Haiti `` It was quite quick , about 10 seconds . \nYou could see the trauma of people . \nYou could see the panic . \n`` Obviously people who had experienced the big earthquake last week - all the trauma comes flooding back . \nThere were real moments of panic . \n`` More buildings collapsed as well and I heard of an orphanage nearby where hundreds of children died yesterday . \n`` The structures which had become unsafe in the big earthquake were so fragile , now further damage has been done .

{"txt": "Ewen MacAskill explores two very different angles on the war in Iraq with Jon Lee Anderson 's The Fall of Baghdad and Clare Short 's An Honourable Deception ? \nNew Labor , Iraq and the Misuse of Power 304pp , Simon & Schuster , # 15 Jon Lee Anderson , an American foreign correspondent for more than 20 years , latterly for the New Yorker , first went to Iraq in 2000 . \nHe was in Baghdad in the run-up to the war , during the bombardment , the immediate aftermath and several times since . \nHis articles in the New Yorker are often admired by other journalists for their easy flow , color and interviews , and he has successfully translated this into book form . \nMuch of the opening concentrates on the frustrations of western journalists trying to cover Saddam 's Iraq : the seemingly endless and arbitrary restrictions imposed by the much-detested ministry of information , with its threats and demands for bribes ; and , given the widespread fear of Saddam , the difficulty of trying to find out what the Iraqi people were really thinking . \nThrough persistence , the job could be done . \nAnderson is good at going back to a limited number of contacts over and over again until he establishes trust ; one of them -LRB- Ala Bashir -RRB- becomes a central character in his book : he was an artist but also one of Saddam 's personal doctors . \nHe covers much the same ground as the Scandinavian journalist Asne Seierstad in her 101 Days : A Baghdad Journal . \nAgainst the background of her success with The Bookseller of Kabul , Seierstad will probably sell more copies than Anderson , but he has written the broader , less personalised account . \nThey were both brave to stay in Iraq during the war ; many journalists who had planned to remain , in the end opted to or were told by their desks to leave . \nThere was a danger that the siege of Baghdad would be long and bloody ; that the Iraqi secret police , the Mukhabarat , might seize journalists as hostages or take revenge on them for the bombing ; or that Saddam might unleash chemical or biological weapons . \nThere was a danger that the siege of Baghdad would be long and bloody . Ewen MacAskill emphasized : `` Saddam 's personal doctor '' was an artist but also one of Saddam 's personal doctors . \nThe question then is whether there is enough to justify 400 pages . \nThe answer is maybe , mainly because of what has happened . \nNoting the first anniversary of the fall of Baghdad , he writes : `` A year had gone by , but it seemed as if Baghdad had not really fallen at all - or perhaps it was still falling . '' \nAnderson , rightly , identifies the US killing of 17 demonstrators in Fallujah about two weeks after the famous fall of the Saddam statue as a `` historic watershed '' . \nThe Iraqis took their revenge , and by the end of the spring `` it was becoming clear that the Americans were faced with an intensifying guerrilla insurgency in Iraq '' . \nA problem with too many books written by journalists about war is that they tend to be mainly about the journalists and less about the population that is suffering . \nAnderson does write probably too much about his colleagues but he also writes movingly about the general population and the suffering . \nOn a visit to a hospital , an Iraqi doctor introduces him to 12-year-old Ali , a victim of the war . \nHis torso is blackened and both his arms burned off . \nHis stumps `` looked like something that might be found in a barbecue pit '' . \nDid he like sports ? \nYes , volleyball and soccer . \nHis mother and father and one of his brothers had been killed , but he had not yet been told . \nOn the whole , though , there is not enough in the book about the Iraqis , especially the poorest , in part because western journalists ' contact with the Iraqi population was often so difficult . \nThere was a brief window of a few months immediately after the war when it was possible for western journalists to travel anywhere and talk openly to almost anyone but Anderson , understandably given he had just covered the war in Iraq , had gone home for most of this period . \nA definitive account of the innermost life of Iraqis before , during and since the war has still to be written , and maybe it will require an Iraqi rather than a western journalist to write it . \nClare Short 's book is not directly about the Iraqis . \nIt deals with the still contentious way in which Tony Blair and his government , of which she was a part , took Britain to war alongside the US . \nSome politicians can make money from their books by selling publication rights to newspa pers , an expensive but easy source of `` exclusives '' . \nOne of the problems with Short 's combined biography and rant against Blair 's administration is that there is little that is exclusive . \nWe already know she feels duped by Blair over the war - the `` honorable deception '' - and the extent of feuding between Blair and Gordon Brown , and the British bugging of Kofi Annan . \nThis lack of news interest is a back-handed compliment . \nShe was always too honest and open , whether in the Commons or in front of a newspaper reporter or a BBC microphone . \nShe did not hold back to ensure largesse when the rights to her book went out to auction . \nHer diary entries , though sparse , form the best part of the book . \nThere is an immediacy about them , the views not influenced by hindsight , particularly her references to Brown , whom she would like to see replace Blair . \nHer critique is that the US and Britain rushed to war in Iraq with unseemly haste and for the wrong reasons . \nShe recalls various conversations with Blair and concludes that he seemed to have been manipulating her , making promises to keep her on side and to delay her resignation , a postponement that damaged her credibility . \nShe , too , may have been at fault , hearing what she wanted to hear , not wanting to lose her beloved department . \nBut her verdict on him is uncompromising : `` The question is , does Tony Blair even realize that he so often gives promises and breaks his word and has so little respect for the truth ? '' \nHer public opposition to the war angered colleagues , who accused her of being sanctimonious and undisciplined . \nBut she was saying in public and to Blair what many of them thought privately but were not prepared to say , either publicly or to Blair . \nby Clare Short This article appeared on p12 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.35 GMT on Saturday 12 February 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting .

{"txt": "NEW YORK | Tue Mar 15 , 2011 11:07 pm GMT NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Private equity firm KKR & Co LP -LRB- KKR . \nN -RRB- is increasing the sources of capital it taps as it gears up to raise its next buyout fund , the company said at its first ever investor day on Tuesday . \nKKR , which raised an $ 18 billion global buyout fund in 2006 , is just starting to raise a new North American-focused fund with a target size of $ 8 billion to $ 10 billion . \nPrivate equity firms raise capital that they typically use to buy companies , turn them around and sell for a higher price , returning the profit to the investors that supplied the capital . \nThe credit crisis limited dealflow and made raising capital for new funds hard , as investors were less willing and able to commit capital to new funds . \nThe harder fundraising environment has caused funds have to search out new investors . \nNuttall said that KKR , which has 350 fund investors or `` limited partners , '' is working on adding more . \nArch-rival Blackstone Group -LRB- BX . \nN -RRB- has more than 1,300 , a source close to the company said . \n`` It is incumbent on us -- and we will do this in the next fundraise that we are in process of doing for North America -- to find other sources of capital that are not invested in us , '' co-founder and co-Chief Executive George Roberts said . \nMore money is being attracted to the alternative investment space , increasingly from new investors , co-founder and co-CEO Henry Kravis said . \nKKR said it has more than $ 11 billion of `` dry powder , '' or capital available to invest , and sees potential deals around the world . \n`` We believe that is incredible capital to take advantage of the opportunities we see in private equity around the globe , '' said Alexander Navab , KKR 's co-head of North American private equity . \nLeveraged buyouts -- the debt-fueled deals private equity is known for -- have been increasing in the past year as financing for deals has become easier to find . \nKKR said North America is attractive for private equity , with improved credit markets and `` generally reasonable '' equity valuations . \nThe company 's European head said KKR sees opportunities in France and the financial services sector . \nIn Asia , KKR cited opportunities in China and said Japan looks attractive from a pure valuation point of view . \nIt is seeking large transactions in markets such as Australia , Singapore , Korea , Japan and India . \nKKR 's $ 11 billion includes $ 3.5 billion of uncommitted capital remaining in its 2006 fund , which will probably prove one of the strongest of its vintage , said Michael Michelson , co-head of North American private equity . \nKKR also raised more than $ 1 billion for a China fund in record time for the firm , Navab said . \nHowever , its European Fund II is valued at 93 percent of cost , which KKR described as `` disappointing -LRB- but -RRB- an improvement on 2009 . '' \nRoberts said KKR probably paid too much for a couple of deals , which was `` probably why Europe II is still not performing '' as it thinks it should . \nIn November Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher suggested that a bubble is forming in private equity , with cheap debt fueling high-priced deals in an echo of the torrid days of LBOs before the subprime credit crisis cut off financing in 2007 . \nKKR remains focused on buyouts even though it has expanded over the past few years into areas such as real estate and capital markets . \n`` Private equity is our heritage , our core business , and we 've been able to build a number of businesses around it , '' Scott Nuttall , global head of capital and asset management , said at the event , which was attended by about 100 investors . \nKKR said it was confident its new long-short team would be in the market soon and raise significant capital over time . \nLast October , KKR hired nine members of Goldman Sachs Group Inc 's -LRB- GS . \nN -RRB- proprietary trading team . \n`` Buyout king '' Kravis , who co-founded KKR nearly 35 years ago , said he and co-founder Roberts think about succession issues every day but added that their stepping down , `` I hope is in the distant future . '' \nKKR has a deep bench of potential successors , Kravis said . \nKKR listed on the New York Stock Exchange on July 15 , joining rival Blackstone Group LP -LRB- BX . \nN -RRB- , which made its debut in 2007 . \nShares of KKR fell 4 percent to close at $ 16.59 on the New York Stock Exchange . \nOther large private equity firms such Carlyle Group CYL . \nUL and Apollo Management APOLO . \nUL are also likely to go public . \nApollo is expected to set terms soon for an IPO of up to $ 500 million , sources told Reuters late on Monday . \nPrivate equity firms going public have sometimes been questioned by investors concerned about whether their interests will be aligned . \nRoberts said that forward-thinking investors realize that `` over the next five years the other established private equity firms will be public in one form or another ... this is a trend and is probably in their best interests as well .

{"txt": "At the start of the Obama administration , Geithner tackled one of the most immense challenges ever to face an economic policymaker : pulling the U.S. economy out of the deepest recession in at least a generation and rescuing a financial system that was in utter disarray . \nAs such , he became a punching bag for criticism of the aggressive Obama strategy to rescue the economy , with some critics even demanding his resignation . \nBut at the start of 2011 , the economy disaster was averted and many of Obama 's top economic hands had departed while Geither , ironically , remained . \nAs Treasury secretary , Geithner allocated the remaining $ 350 billion of the giant financial rescue package known as TARP green-lighted by Congress just days before Obama 's inauguration . \nHe decided which banks and other financial companies to rescue and which to ignore and what conditions the government would attach to the rescue money . \nGeithner also played a significant role in shaping the administration 's $ 787 billion economic stimulus package , enacted in February 2009 . \nAnd he played a lead role in shaping the Dodd-Frank the July 2010 financial regulation overhaul package . \nAs president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2003 to 2009 , Geithner was one of the lead architects of the government response to the 2008-2009 crisis . \nIt was his decision , along with those of Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , to bail out Bear Stearns in March 2008 , to let Lehman Brothers fail in September of that year , and for the government to take over insurance company American International Group . \nBefore any of that , Geithner was a top Treasury Department official in the Clinton years , dealing with the international financial crises of 1995 to 1998 . \nHe was a protege of Clinton administration Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and , especially , Larry Summers . \nSummers was the other leading candidate to be Obama 's Treasury secretary and instead served as a top White House economic adviser . \nAfter a flap about delinquent tax payments , the Senate confirmed Geithner , 60 to 34 , on Jan. 26 , 2009 . \nAmid all the gloom-and-doom , there was one piece of lighthearted news for the fledgling secretary in April 2009 when he was named to People 's annual list of the `` 100 Most Beautiful People . '' \nNews From Around The Web WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says the government has begun borrowing from the federal employee pension fund to keep operating without surpassing its debt limit . \nWASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is telling congressional leaders that the U.S. government will exhaust its borrowing limit as soon as mid-February , earlier than expected . \nWASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is telling congressional leaders that the U.S. government will exhaust its borrowing limit as soon as mid-February , earlier than expected . \nNews From Around The Web WASHINGTON -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar will leave the Obama administration in March , an Obama administration official said Wednesday . \nCareer History : President and CEO , Federal Reserve Bank of New York ; Vice Chairman , Federal Open Market Committee -LRB- Nov. 2003 to Jan. 2009 -RRB- ; Director , Policy Development and Review , International Monetary Fund -LRB- Sept. 2001 to Nov. 2003 -RRB- Alma Mater : Dartmouth College , Bachelor 's Degree , 1983 ; Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , Master 's , 1985 Geithner was born in New York City in 1961 , but he spent most of his youth abroad , living with his family in a variety of countries including India , Thailand , and what is now Zimbabwe . \nHis nomadic childhood inspired an interest in language and culture . \nAn amateur photographer , his travels allowed him to capture unique subjects . \nWhile living in Thailand , he took photographs of refugees and `` turned our bathroom in Bangkok into a darkroom , '' his mother has said . \nGeithner went from Dartmouth to the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , where he received a master 's in international economics and East Asian studies in 1985 . \nGeithner was then hired at Kissinger Associates , the prominent international and business consulting firm founded by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger . \nIn 1988 , Geithner joined the Treasury Department as a career civil servant , working on issues involving Japan as a special assistant to an undersecretary . \nHe worked there through the George H.W. Bush administration and into the Clinton years , when then-Under Secretary Summers was deeply impressed by the young staffer who had the same intellectual intensity as Summers . \nBut Geithner had a more affable manner than the often brusque Harvard economist . \n`` In Geithner , Summers recognized the perfect complement , '' The New Republic reported . \nIndeed , Geithner was one of the few officials who had the brains and self-confidence to stand up to Summers in internal debates . \n`` He 's the only guy that would walk in and say , ` on this one , Larry , you 're full of it , ' '' Summers said . \nSummers promoted Geithner to be a deputy assistant secretary in 1994 , and later to assistant secretary and then under secretary for international affairs . \nIn those jobs , Geithner helped manage the Treasury 's response to the Meixcan peso crisis in 1995 , the East Asian crises of 1997-1998 , and the Russian debt default in 1998 and near-collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management . \nGeithner was the first career civil servant to serve as a Treasury under secretary . \nAt the end of the Clinton administration , Geithner moved to the International Monetary Fund , where he was director of policy development . \nThat period led to a blot on his personal record . \nThe IMF does n't pay the employer match on Social Security and Medicare taxes , meaning Geithner was responsible for paying those taxes himself . \nHe did n't do so , however , until he was audited in 2005 , and even then only paid the back taxes for 2003 and 2004 . \nGeithner did n't pay the back taxes for 2001 and 2002 until after Obama tapped him to be Treasury secretary at the end of 2008 . \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York In 2003 , after a long search , Geithner was named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . \nIn that job , he was the Fed 's eyes and ears on Wall Street , the primary regulator of some of the largest U.S. banks , and one of its lead crisis managers . \nIn the years before the financial crisis began in 2007 , Geithner delivered many speeches discussing weaknesses in the financial regulatory system , especially frailties in the market for credit default swaps and other over-the-counter derivatives . \nThose warnings turned out to be prescient , as those markets contributed to the deep crisis underway . \nHowever , Geithner 's speeches often argued that as a whole the financial system was becoming more stable , and he did not take aggressive action to rein in the risk-taking of Wall Street firms . \nIn August 2008 , financial markets began a wrenching crisis as losses mounted on securities tied to subprime mortgage loans . \nThe crisis had spread to all types of credit products , with transactions freezing up , financial instiutions incurring huge losses and lending drying up throughout the economy . \nAs chairman of the New York Fed , Geithner was a lead architect of the government 's response , including a campaign of interest rate cuts starting in September 2007 that pushed the federal funds rate to near zero by December 2008 . \nIn internal Fed debates , Geithner reliably pushed for more active intervention to guard the economy than did some of his colleagues further from Wall Street . \nHe negotiated the deal to sell failed investment bank Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan Chase in March 2008 , ultimately putting $ 29 billion of Fed assets at risk to get the deal done . \nSix months later , when Lehman Brothers was on the verge of failure , Geithner was more open to saving it than Bush Treasury Secretary Paulson , but Paulson 's hardline position prevailed and it went under . \nJust days later , Geithner engineered the takeover of AIG , the single largest of the government bailouts so far . \nIn February 2009 , Geithner announced his first initiative in stabilizing the financial system . \nCalled the Financial Stability Plan , Geithner outlined what he would do with the $ 350 billion remaining from the TARP fund , including direct capital injections to banks . \nBut Geithner went much further than his predecessor . \nHe announced an initial $ 250 billion to $ 500 billion `` bad bank '' program that would be a joint effort between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to buy toxic assets that banks were n't able to sell . \nAlso included was up to $ 1 trillion in financing for consumers and student loans , including for small businesses , car payments and tuition . \nGeithner fought hard for these initiatives , as the New York Times reported that many in the administration , including Obama senior adviser David Axelrod , wanted tougher restrictions on executive pay and how banks spend taxpayer money . \nBut the final copy of the plan had Geithner 's fingerprints all over it . \nIn May 2009 , the administration released the results of stress tests that financial regulators , including the Fed , FDIC and Treasury 's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , performed on struggling banks that were deemed `` too big to fail . '' \nThe tests were designed to measure what the banks needed , in terms of capital , to withstand a prolonged recession . \nFor three months , regulators examined the bank 's financials , deciding how each company would react if the economy worsened , jobless rates rose and home prices continued to fall . \nMany analysts predicted the banks would need to raise more than $ 100 billion in capital , to pass these tests . \nBut when the Treasury announced the final figures , many of the banks fared much better than expected . \nTen of the 19 banks would need to increase their capital holdings by $ 75 billion dollars , collectively . \nBank of America needed to raise the most capital at nearly $ 34 billion . \nWith the stress tests showing an overall positive outlook for the financial system , banks with sufficient capital could start paying back TARP funds . \n`` With this support , and with the clarity provided by today 's announcement , banks should be able to get back to the business of banking , '' said Geithner when releasing the results of the stress tests . \nTwo weeks after the results of the stress tests were announced , Geithner testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee . \nHe announced that the 10 banks that needed to increase capital had raised or announced plans to raise over $ 48 billion . \nGeithner said in his written statement to the committee that `` there are important indications that our financial system is starting to heal . '' \nGeithner took a lead role in revamping financial regulation , which was shepherded through Congress by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd -LRB- D-Conn . -RRB- \nand Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- . \nIt was enacted in July 2010 . \nThe bill would allow for the orderly dissolution of big financial institutions whose destruction would threaten the entire U.S. economy at no cost to taxpayers ; for the first time , regulate the derivatives market that was blamed for helping to cause the 2008-2008 meltdown ; create a financial council overseen by the Treasury Department to coordinate and monitor risk in the financial markets ; create an independent consumer watchdog inside the Federal Reserve to give U.S. consumers clear information regarding financial products like credit cards and mortgages ; and imposes regulations on derivatives trading , requiring most of it to take place in open marketplaces . \nIn written 2009 remarks to the Senate Finance Committee , Geithner signaled a more aggressive approach to negotiating trade policies with China . \nThe Chinese government artificially deflates its currency , the renmibi or yuan , which leads to cheap exports . \nAhead of Chinese President Hu Jintao 's January 2011 state visit to the U.S. , Geithner delivered a speech arguing that China must move more aggressively to increase the value of the yuan , as well as address intellectual-property theft . \n`` We believe it is in China 's interest to allow the currency to appreciate more rapidly in response to market forces . \nAnd we believe China will do so because the alternative will be too costly - both for China and for China 's relations with the rest of the world , '' Geithner said . \nIn 2010 , the House approved a special tax to offset what lawmakers believed was China 's `` currency manipulation , '' although the Senate did n't vote on the issue . \nGeithner has spent more years in public service than many of the former Street veterans he works with , but his connections tie him to the slew of Goldman Sachs alumni that have recently populated the Treasury Department , including Rubin and former Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , both former Goldman chairmen . \nIt was Rubin who gave a young Geithner his shot at bigger things at the Treasury , and the New York Times says Geithner ` slack of work experience in the financial sector , `` has left him reliant on Wall Street chiefs to guide his thinking and that Goldman alumni have figured prominently in his ascent . '' \nGeithner is also a member of the Group of 30 , a nonprofit that brings together thirty of the most influential people from the public and private sectors . \nMembers include Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman , and Larry Summers , a former high-profile Obama economic adviser . \nGeithner spent six months of 2001 as a senior fellow on the Council on Foreign Relations and is still a member of its advisory board , along with Stephen Friedman and former secretary of state Madeleine Albright .

{"txt": "Thursday , August 5 , 2010 ; 5:07 PM BP has finished pumping cement into the blown-out Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico as part of its efforts to permanently plug the source of the nation 's worst oil spill , the company said Thursday . \nThe cementing operation , which began at 4:30 p.m. CDT -LRB- 2:30 pm EDT -RRB- , was part of BP 's `` bottom kill , '' which involves pumping mud into the well from the surface . \nIt was the second step in the `` static kill , '' in which heavy mud was first pumped into the well from the surface to stop it from leaking crude into the gulf . \nBP said in a statement that the static kill procedure will `` complement '' a separate effort to plug the well through a relief well that is nearing completion in a technique known as the `` bottom kill . '' \nEarlier , the company announced that retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the national incident commander for the disaster , had authorized the cementing operation , which was under consideration following the successful effort to pump mud into the well . \nThe development comes a day after the Macondo well became an apparently harmless hole in the seafloor , clogged with 13-pound-per-gallon gunk , and barely more of a threat to spew oil into the Gulf of Mexico than to start gushing lemonade . \nOn the 107th day of the Deepwater Horizon disaster , the well that tormented the nation had flatlined . \nFederal officials then green-lighted the cementing of the well , already jammed with mud , late Wednesday . \nFederal waters are reopening gradually to fishing . \nThe oil slick , the once-horrific expanse of red-orange mousse and silver sheen , has largely disappeared , federal scientists said Wednesday , even though the amount of oil left is more than four times that dumped by the Exxon Valdez . \nThe Obama administration breathed a sigh of relief , holding a midday news conference featuring top officials who claimed credit for guiding BP in getting the well under control . \nOfficials hastened to remind the public that Macondo wo n't be incontrovertibly dead until a relief well drills into it near its base and plugs it with cement . \nBut even the cautious Allen , the official in charge of the federal response to the disaster , called the static kill a `` fairly consequential '' event and a `` very significant step . '' \nAbout three-quarters of the nearly 5 million barrels of oil that escaped Macondo has evaporated , dissolved or been dispersed by chemicals , skimmed by boats , burned , weathered and , most important , devoured by the Gulf of Mexico 's permanent oil-eating microbial workforce , according to a study released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Interior Department . \n`` Mother Nature is assisting here considerably , '' said NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco . \nThis should terminate , once and for all , the more apocalyptic scenarios for the demise of the gulf and the spread of oil to Atlantic shores . \nThere is no sign that the oil is going to ride the Loop Current onto the beaches of South Florida , the Outer Banks , Bermuda , Ireland and so on . \nJust a month ago , the spill was an uncontrolled calamity : Macondo mocked the technological skills of the world 's petroleum engineers , and oil was slathering birds and turtles and tar-balling hundreds of miles of coastline . \nThe turning point came when BP put a new tight-fitting cap on the well July 12 and closed the valves three days later , cutting off the ugly geyser of oil that had become a dominant image of the summer . \nFederal scientists have said that vigilance would be called for even after the static kill procedure worked , which , according to BP in a 2 a.m. announcement , it did . \nBP sent out a bulletin declaring success after spending eight hours pumping mud into the well from surface ships . \nNews , features , and opinions on environmental policy , the science of climate change , and tools to live a green life .

'' \n`` That can not and will not happen anymore , '' he said , adding that the government `` will trust , but we will verify . '' \nSalazar has called for a plan to split the agency in two . \nOne agency would be charged with inspecting oil rigs , investigating oil companies and enforcing safety regulations , while the other would oversee leases for drilling and collection of billions of dollars in royalties . \nThat would separate the agency 's two core responsibilities , which critics say are diametrically opposed -- making money off the industry , while also cracking down on it in ways that may affect the industry 's bottom line . \nEnvironmental groups have criticized the agency for giving the Deepwater Horizon a `` categorical exclusion '' from a environmental impact study of the operation or a serious assessment of its inherent risks . \nThat exemption was granted 11 days before the underwater exploratory rig exploded . \nThe agency , which is part of the Interior Department , has also given a light regulatory touch to other offshore projects . \nObama also said that no one knows exactly how much oil is leaking because human inspectors can not reach the mile-deep well head . \nHe said he would not rest until the leak is stopped , the oil is contained and cleaned up , and people of the Gulf region resume normal lives . \nFox News ' Major Garrett contributed to this report .

'' \nThe report , set for Wednesday afternoon release but reported by the Wall Street Journal , draws largely on evidence that has already emerged in the course of other inquiries into the April 20 blowout at the Macondo well . \nThe blowout killed 11 people aboard the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , which caught fire and sank , triggering the enormous oil spill . \nThe committee of academics appears to have been taken aback by the education and training levels of people on the rig . \nThe chairman of the committee is Donald C. Winter , professor in the University of Michigan 's Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering . \n`` Personnel on the Deepwater Horizon were mostly trained on the job , and this training was supplemented with limited short courses , '' the report said . \n`` While this appears to be consistent with industry standard practice and current regulations cents it is not consistent with other safety-critical industries such as nuclear power or chemical manufacturing .

'' \nBack to the real world , and an important point noted in a few of the papers today : all those who have shown symptoms of swine flu outside Mexico so far have recovered . \nThings could change at any moment . \nBut more worrisome is the corrosive and contagious quality of the fear , not the flu . \nAnd frankly the economic impact of this outbreak has the potential to be even more painful and long-lasting for all of us . \nYet the panicky atmosphere in Mexico City is palpably toxic . \nSo I 'm heading out of town for a few days -- before they really do shut down the metro . \nSchool is canceled and most ` fun ' things are closed . \nSouth Korea has announced its first probable case of swine flu . \nFinal tests are still necessary to confirm whether a 51-year-old woman has contracted the disease , the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement , AP reported . \nThe woman has remained quarantined since returning from a trip to Mexico on Sunday . \nMacDoctor is worried about the prospect of a pandemic as the southern hemisphere enters its flu season . \nWe are about to go into our busiest time of year with health services normally being pushed to the max by respiratory illnesses . \nAdd all the possible swine flu sufferers and you have a recipe for a completely overwhelmed health service . \nAdd everyone with cold and flu symptoms -LRB- understandably -RRB- panicking and trying to access the heath system to find out whether they have the disease or not and we have all the makings of utter chaos . \nWhy is swine flu causing death in Mexico but not elsewhere ? \nThe Mexican paper La Jornada says the answer is simple : `` The inevitable contrast between the deaths in Mexico and the cases caused by the virus in the United States , which seem to be much more benign , has an equally inevitable explanation : poverty . '' \nMy Spanish-speaking colleague , Robert White , says the paper castigates successive governments for pursuing neoliberal policies of `` trimming the state '' . \nLa Jornada says this ensured that the long-awaited announcement of such a flu outbreak was always `` bound to be disastrous '' and fatal for many of those infected . \nAt a press conference in Poland , Gordon Brown said he would be attending a meeting of the civil emergencies committee known as Cobra to discuss the swine flu crisis when he returned to London later this morning . \nBrown also said that one of the patients in a Scottish hospital with swine flu was expected to go home today . \n`` I understand the very real concern that people across Britain , across Europe and across the world have about this outbreak of swine flu disease , '' he said . \nBritish holiday tour companies Thomson and First Choice have suspended their operations to Mexico today . \nGregory Hartl , a spokesman for the WHO , told a news conference in Geneva that the WHO emergency committee will not be meeting today . \nYesterday the committee recommended raising the pandemic threat level . \nHartl said the WHO does not recommend travel restrictions or border closures due to swine flu . \nA journalist complains that it has been impossible to reach WHO officials . \nHartl admits that he has 2,800 unanswered calls . \nOn reports of new suspected cases in China , Hartl said : `` We have rumors all the time . \nIt 's important that we hear rumors , they may turn out to be unfounded .

{"txt": "U.S. President Barack Obama talks after touring the Coast Guard Venice Center in the Gulf of Mexico region to view environmental damage caused by the sinking of BP 's oil and gas Deepwater Horizontal drilling rig while in Venice , Louisiana , May 2 , 2010 . \nWASHINGTON | Fri May 21 , 2010 9:03 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama has prevented the BP oil spill from becoming his own Katrina-like nightmare so far , but the political and policy consequences of the disaster are likely to increase as the oil spreads . \nBy repeatedly assigning blame to energy giant BP Plc and focusing ire on the government agency responsible for regulating offshore drilling , Obama has deflected criticism that his administration was sluggish in its initial response to the Gulf of Mexico spill . \nThat may not last . \nA month since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank , killing 11 people and leaving a ruptured well that has been leaking crude ever since , the feared environmental catastrophe is becoming more and more real . \nHeavy oil is hitting Louisiana 's wetlands . \nOil-stained animals are being rescued and cleaned . \n \nOil is also washing up on coastal beaches in Mississippi , Alabama , Mississippi and Florida . \nAnalysts say as the ecological crisis gains traction , voters will punish the president regardless of who is responsible -- an important consideration for Obama ahead of congressional elections in November . \n`` There is a strong tendency for the public to penalize incumbents even for natural disasters if there is a plausible governmental angle -- regardless of whether the government failed to respond adequately , '' said Eric Schickler , a political science professor at the University of California , Berkley . \n`` If the oil spill has a significant impact on the Gulf Coast economy -- and as a result , on the U.S. economy as a whole -- it is likely to impose at least some damage on the president and his party . '' \nObama 's Democrats , who control both houses of Congress , are expected to lose seats in the election and want to avoid shifting power to Republicans , who would make it more difficult for the president to achieve his policy goals . \nObama is aware of the government angle in the crisis and has made his displeasure with the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , the Interior Department agency that regulates offshore drilling , very clear . \nThat agency is now being restructured , but other policy consequences loom , most notably the president 's efforts to pass energy legislation that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase domestic production of renewable fuels and -- tricky under current circumstances -- expand offshore drilling . \nJohn Leshy , who served as general counsel for the Interior Department in the Clinton administration , said the spill could hurt Obama 's short-term prospects for an energy overhaul . \n`` Clearly the spill has dramatized the cost of fossil fuels -- coal , oil and gas , particularly oil . \nSo to that extent it has , I think , boosted the idea that there needs to be energy reform , '' said Leshy , now a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law . \n`` But in the short term you have to get 60 votes in the Senate , '' he said . \n`` I think the spill has made that harder . '' \nAn energy bill introduced by Democratic Senator John Kerry and independent Senator Joe Lieberman is languishing in the 100-member legislative body . \nThe offshore drilling provisions were meant to attract Republican support for the bill . \nObama 's action plan for advancing that energy law is not clear , but his strategy for dealing with the oil spill has been to act fast . \nMindful of the political damage incurred by President George W. Bush 's administration for its response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Obama has not wasted any opportunity to show he is moving quickly and assigning blame . \n`` Katrina was a natural disaster . \nThis is a man-made disaster , '' said Ken Medlock , an energy fellow at Rice University in Houston , Texas . \n`` With this particular case , from Day One the Coast Guard has been on the scene . \nThe federal government , as a result , has been involved from Day One . '' \nLarry Sabato , director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia , said Obama had learned from Katrina and made clear BP carried the blame for this Gulf disaster . \n`` Obama has a made-to-order bad guy in BP . \nAnd he sure has n't been hesitant about pointing fingers , '' Sabato said . \nBad guy or not , public anger about the spill has not helped Obama prevail in getting Congress to raise the cap on oil companies ' liability for big spills . \nIt has also given Republicans , whose support Obama needs to achieve his energy overhaul , potential ammunition against the administration if MMS is found to have been negligent . \n`` The president has spent a whole lot of time pointing the finger at BP and you should point a finger at BP and the other companies involved , '' Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' show . \n`` We 're also interested to know what the administration did . \nWas the Mineral Management Service a part of this administration that approved this site ? \nIt also approved this spill response plan . \nWhat kind of oversight did the administration provide during the course of the drilling ? '' \nObama plans to create a presidential commission to answer questions such as these and identify the causes of the spill . \nThe amount of time he has will depend on how soon BP plugs the well , how far the oil flows , and how focused the U.S. public remains on the role of companies rather than the role of the government in this environmental crisis . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nBan all offshore drilling . \nImpose consumption taxes on SUV and pick-up trucks -LRB- unless commercially licensed -RRB- Raise taxes on gas to $ 10\\/gallon to deter waste . \nSuffer the consequences , America . \nYour children and grandchildren are going to live in poverty and filth thanks to your greed and gluttony . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-05-21__801.rsd.txt.ll_filled"}

{"txt": "cents CEO Tony Hayward warned he faces grilling cents Obama compares impact of oil spill with 9\\/11 Barack Obama speaks at a briefing on the BP oil spill in Gulfport , Mississippi . \nPhotograph : Jim Young\\/Reuters BP is being accused by a US congressional committee of ignoring warnings , violating its own industry guidelines , and choosing risky procedures in the hope of cutting costs and saving time in the days leading up to the catastrophic explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . \nTony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , was served notice on Monday by the committee on energy and commerce that it intends to subject him to the most rigorous inquisition the company has yet faced in the 56-day-old crisis . \nA letter from the committee 's chairman , Henry Waxman , said `` time after time , it appears BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time or expense '' . \nHayward 's hearing will take place on Thursday , towards the end of a crucial week in which the tensions between US politicians and BP are likely to escalate . \nBarack Obama will tonight make his first address to the American people from the Oval Office , underlining the scale of the catastrophe now unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico and vowing to hold BP to account for the environmental damage wrought by its eight-week-old oil spill . \nObama is expected to use the speech to outline plans to force the firm to set up an independently monitored multibillion-dollar fund to compensate victims of the spill . \nHe will also lay out a detailed timeline of how the worst of the calamity could be contained . \nHours before the broadcast , the energy and environment sub-committee of the House of Representatives will call senior BP officials in front of it to answer questions on the company 's handling of the crisis . \nThen tomorrow , Obama will hold his first meeting with a team of top BP staff led by the chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , and expected to include Hayward who has so far avoided a face-to-face encounter with the president . \nBut it will be the forensic questioning of Hayward in front of Thursday 's committee on energy and commerce upon which BP 's fate now potentially hangs . \nWaxman 's advance letter runs to 14 pages and contains damaging allegations gathered during previous hearings . \nFive days before the 20 April explosion , the letter contends , BP was warned by its own drilling engineer that this was a `` nightmare well '' . \nYet the firm went on to make five crucial decisions that the committee alleges put profit before safety . \nBP , at this point , was up against the clock , attempting to complete drilling so that the Deepwater Horizon rig could be moved to another location , avoiding overrun costs . \nThe five accusations levelled at BP by the committee are : cents That it adopted a cheap design for the well , choosing a single casing rather than a more sophisticated design , despite the fact that its own analysis found strongly in favor of the latter . \n`` The decision appears to have been made to save time and reduce costs , '' the letter says . \ncents BP went with the cheapest option of using just six `` centralisers '' , which hold the casing in the center of the borehole , despite being advised by its contractors Halliburton to use 21 . \nHalliburton warned that the well had a `` SEVERE gas flow problem '' and that using six centralisers would risk the success of the procedure . \ncents BP decided not to carry out an acoustic test designed to measure the efficacy of the cementing of the well to block off gas flows . \nThe test would have cost $ 128,000 and taken an extra 12 hours . \nAn independent engineer who gave evidence to the committee said it was `` unheard of '' not to perform the test and slammed the decision as being `` horribly negligent '' . \ncents BP failed to check the proper workings of the new well system by circulating drilling mud from its bottom to the surface . \nHalliburton suggested the lack of a full test was due to BP 's desire for speed . \ncents The firm did not install a critical piece of equipment that locks the wellhead and the casing at the level of the sea floor . \nThe absence of the `` lockdown sleeve '' has been identified as one possible cause of the explosion . \nWaxman 's letter concludes that BP must answer to the committee for possible `` carelessness and complacency '' that `` inflicted a heavy toll on the Gulf , its inhabitants and the workers on the rig . \nThe new offensive by Congress came as Obama began a two-day visit to the stricken region . \nAfter he had landed in Gulfport , Mississippi , he likened the environmental impact of the Deep Horizon explosion to the impact on the national psyche of 9\\/11 . \nIn an interview with the website Politico , he said : `` In the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9\\/11 , I think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come . '' \nThe comparison drew some angry responses from families of the victims of the 9\\/11 attacks . \nBP has now passed a 72-hour ultimatum set for it by the Obama administration to come up with a more focused plan for how to bring the spill under control . \nWorst-case scenarios , estimated by US government scientists , suggest that up to 40,000 barrels of oil could be spewing out into the Gulf each day , with only 15,000 barrels currently being collected by a cap placed over the wrecked well . \nThe company has outlined a series of methods it intends to implement that it claims will see the amount of captured oil rise to up to 80,000 barrels a day by mid-July . \nThe Democrat congressman is famous for in 1994 forcing chiefs of tobacco giants to swear under oath that nicotine was not addictive . \nHe will seek the same killer punch against Tony Hayward on Thursday , when BP 's CEO appears before a panel of the House energy and commerce committee . \nExpect him to press Hayward hard on whether BP put profit before safety . \nWith a long track record of holding power to account from the nuclear electricity industry to the US government over torture Markey has become a leading critic of BP 's handling of the Deepwater Horizon crisis . \n`` They are either incompetent or they are lying , '' he has said of BP chiefs . \nToday the Democratic congressman will call BP America 's president , Lamar McKay , as well as the bosses of rival oil companies in front of his House energy and environment sub-committee . \nLikely line of questioning : why BP 's estimates of the size of the spill have been so massively wide of the mark . \nBarack Obama 's press spokesman , who has been `` kicking ass '' on the president 's behalf , has been accused of whipping up anti-British feeling by referring to British Petroleum rather than BP , the firm 's rebranded name . \nHe has also used such fruity language as : `` We will keep our boot on the throat of BP '' . \nGibbs says the administration is just focused on what 's right . \nThe US coastguard admiral who Obama put in charge of the clean-up operation last week issued BP with a 72-hour ultimatum to come up with solid plans on how to contain the leak . \nAllen has been careful in his criticisms of BP until now , saying it has generally been co-operative . \nBut daily media exposure of Allen , in which he has come across as energetic and action-oriented , has only served to make BP look all the more incompetent .

{"txt": "Search for new homes , condos , and other real estate in Washington , D.C. , Maryland and Virginia . \nWith a presidential campaign in the middle of a financial crisis , it is not surprising that we are besieged with misinformation . \nMuch of it is finger-pointing about responsibility for the absence of effective regulation that would have prevented or moderated the crisis . \nWho has political responsibility for inadequate regulation ? \nThere are two financial sectors where more extensive regulation might have made a difference . \nThese are the investment banks and the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . \nBoth sectors were major players in the events leading up to the crisis . \nIn 2004 , the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that pretty much allowed investment banks to regulate themselves . \nWhile a number of other factors were involved in this decision , the commission 's belief was that self-regulation would be more effective than SEC regulation . \nThis was consistent with the free-market ideology of the Republican administration . \nIn 2003 , Congress defeated efforts to bring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under tighter regulatory control . \nThis was primarily the work of Democrats , who feared that tighter regulation would crimp the ability of the mortgage-market companies to meet affordable-housing goals . \nI call it a tie between the two parties . \nI hasten to add that had both financial sectors been subject to regulation , an only slightly less severe crisis would have occurred , for reasons explained below . \nDeregulation , meaning the scrapping of existing regulations , was not a factor in the crisis . \nThe only significant financial deregulation in the past three decades applied to commercial banks . \nRestrictions on where they could have branches and on their involvement in investment banking were both removed . \nMost economists , including me , believe that these actions made the banks stronger than they would have been otherwise . \nRegulation in itself is a weak defense against financial crises . \nOne major reason is that it tends to look backward , similar to generals fighting the last war . \nThe savings-and-loan industry was subject to extensive regulation in the 1970s , but that did not prevent the subsequent crisis . \nThe problem was that the wrong things were regulated . \nThe regulatory system was geared to preventing S&Ls from taking on too much default risk because , historically , that had been the major problem . \nThe exposure of S&Ls to interest rate risk was not controlled . \nThe S&Ls were allowed , even encouraged , to make long-term , fixed-rate mortgages financed with short-term deposits . \nWhen market interest rates exploded in the early 1980s , the cost of deposits jumped , income from mortgages barely changed and the industry began to bleed red ink . \nThe policy changes that were introduced after the S&L crisis were largely designed to prevent another crisis of that type . \nAmong other things , associations were authorized -LRB- and encouraged -RRB- to write adjustable-rate mortgages . \nThis would make S&Ls , as well as banks , less vulnerable to swings in market rates . \nHowever , ARMs carry more default risk than fixed-rate mortgages , and as the years passed , interest-only and payment-option ARMs evolved that carried substantially more default risk . \nAs the system became increasingly secure against an interest rate shock , it became increasingly vulnerable to a default shock . \nPreventing a default shock through existing regulatory tools would be difficult . \nThe core tool is capital requirements : The amount of capital including reserves that firms are required to have to cover the risk of losses from future defaults . \nThe problem is that nobody knows how large any future default shocks will be . \nRegulators have no better foresight than do the firms they regulate . \nBoth use statistical models based on experience . \nA change in the underlying structure of the economy can make such history irrelevant , which is exactly what has happened . \nNobody anticipated the severity of the current crisis because , relative to the past , it is off the chart . \nBut does n't that mean that regulators , who are not motivated by profit , should err on the side of caution ? \nTo a degree , yes . \nIf that were not the case , regulation would be pointless . \nBut capital requirements that are higher than needed to meet potential shocks not only reduce profits but also impose social costs , to which regulators are sensitive . \nLarger capital requirements reduce loan volume and raise interest rates , a fact well understood by the congressmen who resisted tightening regulatory controls on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . \nBetter regulatory tools are needed . \nWe should take a hard look at applying the system used to regulate mortgage insurance companies to mortgage lenders . \nUnder this system , lenders would be required to allocate a portion of every dollar they receive in interest above some base rate to a reserve account that would not be touchable for 10 years except in an emergency . \nThe higher the interest rate , the larger the payment to the reserve account . \nCan we prevent this sort of problem from happening again ? \nYes , but the next crisis will almost certainly be different .

{"txt": "By Pallab Ghosh Science correspondent , BBC News A study of the effects of the Deepwater Horizon spill has confirmed the presence of a toxic chemical residue one kilometre below the sea surface . \nThe investigation , carried out in June , shows a plume of crude oil-based chemicals up to 200m high and 2km wide , extending 35km from the spill site . \nThe results are published in the journal Science . \nThere had already been speculation that large quantities of oil from the spill remained dissolved in the sea at depth . \nThis new research confirms that a plume , or cloud , does indeed exist below the surface . \nBut it also shows that the amount is relatively small - possibly less than 0.1 % of the total amount spilled . \nMembers of the research team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts , US , have been cautious about commenting on the significance of their study . \nUnderstanding how this plume is dispersing ... will determine how quickly deepwater fishing can resume in the Gulf '' End Quote Simon Boxall Southampton University Dr Chris Reddy of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute , who was among those involved in the research , said he was unable to speculate , at this stage , what impact the plume would have on marine life in the area . \n`` I 'd -LRB- need -RRB- a much better inventory of all the molecules that make up the oil before -LRB- I could -RRB- start to get an idea , '' he said . \nJane Lubchenco , head of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- , and one of the most senior scientists in the US , commented : `` We are all served best by proceeding in a careful , thoughtful , and quantifiable manner , where we can actually document everything and share it publicly . '' \nMarine experts said the US researchers ' study offered an important insight into the extent of the oil spill 's impact on the region 's marine ecology . \nDr Simon Boxall from the University of Southampton , National Oceanography Centre , UK , said : `` This is actually an optimistic outlook and allays fears that huge plumes of oil lie in the deep ocean . '' \nDr Martin Preston , an expert on marine pollution at the University of Liverpool , said that although the plume contained many toxic chemicals , they were at very low concentrations and at a depth where relatively few marine animals are found . \nAny concerns that oxygen would be depleted by the plume breaking up and creating so-called `` dead zones '' were unfounded , he added . \n`` Oil plumes are normally broken up by microscopic organisms in a process that uses up oxygen in the sea water , '' he said . \n`` If this happens rapidly , oxygen can reach dangerously low levels at the expense of marine animals . \nSo the fact that the oil is breaking up slowly and moving away from the coastline is good news in the short-term . '' \nBut the plume 's resilience means that there is also some bad news : the oil components are not degrading quickly and are likely to remain for several months or longer . \nDr Benjamin Van Mooy , another principal investigator of the research team , said : `` If the oxygen data from the plume layer are telling us it is n't being rapidly consumed by microbes near the well the hydrocarbons could persist for some time . \n`` So it is possible that oil could be transported considerable distances from the well before being degraded . '' \nDr Boxall said it would be important to continue monitoring the region . \n`` Understanding how this plume is dispersing and breaking down will determine how quickly deepwater fishing can resume in the Gulf , '' he said . \nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

'' \nThe Guardian 's Simon Tisdall writes that the media 's fixation on the swine flu has detracted from attention to the widespread misery and violence in other parts of the world : The sudden surge in first world swine fever has also overshadowed the plight of millions in the Horn of Africa , principally in Somalia where a reconfigured government is struggling to survive . \nRandom violence , suicide attacks , kidnapping and armed robbery are daily problems facing the 3 million people currently dependent on food aid . \nOver 1 million Somalis are displaced , many living in insanitary tent cities . \nFor them , flu is not a big issue . \nEgyptian health ministers said today that the cull of 250,000 pigs was not in fact an anti-flu measure , but a more general santitation effort . \nAn Egyptian health ministry official tells AFP : The authorities took advantage of the situation to resolve the question of disorderly pig rearing in Egypt . \nMexican President Felipe Calderon effectively shut down the country 's economy today , asking that only essential businesses like supermarkets , pharmacies , and gas stations remain open until Tuesday . \nOnly critical government functions like police and the army will remain on the job . \n`` Stay in your house with your family , '' Calderon said in a televised address . \n`` There is no safer place to avoid contact with the influenza virus than your own home .

'' \nSome updates from our hard working global newsgathering and comment team : Former middle east editor Brian Whitaker , now an editor on Comment is free , says the pig cull ordered by the Egyptian government `` is likely to be interpreted by Christians as yet another assault on their community '' . \nThe World Bank says a Washington-based employee has been `` preliminarily diagnosed '' with the swine flu -LRB- or the H1N1 flu , as politically correct types are saying here -RRB- . \nThe infection is believed to have resulted from exposure while on business travel in Mexico between April 14-18 , before Mexican health authorities and the WHO recognized and announced the epidemic . \nThe final diagnosis has to be confirmed by a second test performed by the Center for Disease Control , a process which is underway . \nHealth officials in the state of Delware have confirmed four cases of swine flu there , Reuters is reporting . \nAlso , EU health ministers have ruled out a Mexico travel ban proposed by France . \nPublic Health Minister Dawn Primarolo backed the vast majority in warning it was too late to try to isolate the virus following the World Health Organisation 's decision to raise its status to that of an imminent pandemic . \nInstead the ministers today concentrated their efforts on agreeing -LRB- on -RRB- the closest possible cross-border co-operation to keep track of the spread of emerging cases of what the European Commission was calling the `` novel '' flu virus . \nReuters reports that EU health ministers agreed that individual member states should decide on travel restrictions aimed at stemming the virus . \nThe WHO and the US have several times ruled out travel bans or restrictions , saying they would do little to slow the spread of the virus . \nThe British government next week will post an information leaflet to all households offering advice on how to stay clear of the swine flu . \nAP is reporting that US public health officials are intercepting migrant seasonal workers entering the country from Mexico and handing them information on swine-flu symptoms and prevention tips . \nHealth officials worry the migrant workers , who provide essential labor for industries like seafood and meat packing , construction and landscaping , may bring the swine flu virus into the states with them and spread it . \nThe WHO is now referring to the bug as influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , not swine flu , probably out of deference to the global pork industry and to avoid giving the impression that the disease can be caught from pigs . \nPresident Barack Obama last night used that term . \nThe White House has just announced that a member of the group that traveled with President Obama to Mexico April 16 and 17 came down with flu-like symptoms . \nMembers of his family have since tested `` probable '' for the swine flu . \nThe individual was part of Energy Secretary Steven Chu 's advance security detail , and never got within six feet of the president , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters . \nMexican health secretary Jos ngel C rdova says the number of new swine flu cases in the country is stabilising . \nHe says Mexico has 260 confirmed swine flu cases , including 12 deaths . \nBut he says he 'll stop updating his count of suspected cases and deaths , which had stood at about 2,500 and 168 . \n`` Swine flu '' or `` H1N1 '' ? \nAs we 've reported , the US government and the WHO have dropped the former name , out of deference to the pigs -LRB- and their breeders and sellers -RRB- .

{"txt": "How flu strains adapt to be able to infect a new species is still a mystery The flu virus is a survivor . \nIts genetic code is made up of thousands of genes , many of which are found on the surface of the virus itself . \nMammals , including humans , make antibodies , which recognize and target the virus . \n`` So it has to keep mutating to escape being destroyed , '' explains David Morens from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . \nDespite these tactics , most of the strains that make people ill during the so-called `` flu season '' are sufficiently similar to infections most of us have been exposed to before . \nOur immune systems recognize common parts that these new strains share with their ancestors , and can launch an effective defense . \nEvery so often , however , a different strain emerges and infects people - one that contains new genes from an animal virus . \nIts novelty is its most effective weapon against our immune defences . \nAnd if it is infectious enough to find its way easily into a new host - perhaps via an innocent sneeze - it can spread rapidly and cause a global epidemic - or pandemic . \n`` These events seem to be cyclical - they 've occurred about every 20-40 years , '' says Mark Honigsbaum a researcher at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London . \n`` And all of these pandemics have been associated with just a few strains , '' he says . \nViral strains take their name from the various different types of two important proteins on their surface . \nTheir initials are H for haemaglutanin , and N for neuraminidase . \nHistory teaches us that these pandemics ... are predictably unpredictable The haemaglutanin molecule protrudes from the surface of the virus as spikes , and enables it to lock on to receptors on the surface of cells . \nNeuraminidase allows the virus to be released from infected cells and infect new ones . \n`` There are 16 Hs and 9 Ns , but as far as we know , only H1 ,2,3 and only N1 and N2 have ever made it into a human virus , '' says Dr Morens . \nBut beyond what is currently speculation that only a few strains may be transmissible among humans , the structure of flu gives us almost no clues about how it might behave and change . \n`` History teaches us to take these pandemics very seriously , '' says Howard Markel , director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan . \n`` But it also teaches us that they are predictably unpredictable . '' \nThe first of the four pandemics was Russian flu - each takes its name from the country where the first case was reported - which emerged in 1889 . \nThis was well before the science of virology had even been conceived . \nIt rapidly spread through Europe , and reached North America and Latin America , lasting until 1892 and eventually killing an estimated one million people . \nMedical facilities were overwhelmed by the 1918 flu pandemic `` We have very little information about this strain , '' says Dr Morens . \n`` But in the mid 1900s , scientists started collecting , and more importantly preserving , serum samples from people who had been alive during the flu pandemic . \nSo there is now some evidence that it could have been an H3 virus . \n`` If it turned out to be true that only limited types of influenza genes have the ability to work in a human virus , that would be important , because you could vaccinate the world 's population against the known possibilities of a pandemic virus , '' he says . \nAlthough at its early stages , work is already progressing on a universal vaccine - one that would stimulate human immune systems to recognize , and raise antibodies against parts of the influenza virus shared by all strains . \nBut , during the last century , the virus has shown a deadly ability to change beyond recognition . \nIn 1918 , an influenza pandemic started that became a global disaster - eventually killing more people than the Great War . \nEstimates of the death toll from the 1918 outbreak of Spanish flu range from 20 million to 40 million . \nSome historians argue it could have been as high as 100 million . \n`` There was a mild wave in the spring , but the very serious , lethal wave was in the autumn to the winter , '' says Professor Markel . \n`` Then a third wave in January to April 1919 , and a fourth wave in the winter of 1920 . '' \nThis tendency for `` waves '' of infection and re-infection makes the virus yet more unpredictable . \nNew vaccines for circulating strains are now designed every year At the time the medical consensus was that the disease was caused not by a virus , but by a bacterium called Haemophilus influenzae . \nSo some countries , including the US and UK , distributed vaccinations against the wrong disease-causing agent . \n`` Another problem was that the authorities stuck their heads in the sand , '' says Mr Honigsbaum . \n`` Their priority was the war and they did n't have the resources to deal with the health crisis . \n`` There 's an argument that if they 'd been more proactive , and diverted doctors and nurses from the front to civilian needs , they could have saved more lives . '' \nDr Morens refers to the 1918 H1N1 strain as `` the mother of all pandemics '' . \n`` In the category of Influenza A , which is the category of virus that has caused all human epidemics and pandemics , every virus circulated since 1918 has been a descendent of this virus in one way or another , '' he says . \n`` Descendants of the 1918 pandemic are still infecting human beings , but they have mutated again and again and again to be able to survive . '' \nThe 1918 influenza pandemic gripped a vulnerable , unprepared human population , but its ability to `` reassort '' - or exchange its genes with other viruses - was what made it `` dangerously novel '' . \nWe had two lineages of the disease , both of which have persisted National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases `` Every species has its own flu - when those species live together , and they can transmit their flu to different species , the virus itself changes its structure , '' says Professor Markel . \nSince our immune systems recognize and respond mainly to the H and N part of the molecule , scientists suspect that pandemics arise when a strain emerges with a big change in the structure of one of these proteins . \nBut how exactly the virus adapts to enable it to attach to receptors on the cells of a different species , is an `` unanswerable '' question , says Dr Morens . \n`` With only four pandemics in over 100 years , our sample size is too small to say , but it seems that a new H -LRB- on the surface of the virus -RRB- has been the major factor , '' says Dr Morens . \n`` We do n't know where the 1918 virus came from , but the evidence is that it was a new virus . \n`` At the same time that it infected humans , it also infected pigs . \nAnd at that point , we began to have two lineages of that disease - the human virus , and the pig virus , which persisted too , '' he adds . \nThe progeny of the 1918 influenza strain evolved and mutated as they were transmitted from one host to another . \nAnd on two further occasions , these strains incorporated completely new genes and spread globally once again . \n`` That 's what happened in 1957 and 1968 - a hybrid formed of the 1918 virus with genes that were never part of it before , '' says Dr Morens . \nIn the case of the 1957 Asian flu outbreak , a human H2N2 virus combined with the genes of a strain found in wild ducks . \nThe pandemic killed an estimated one million people worldwide . \nAn outbreak of H3N2 Hong Kong flu in 1968 , when avian and human virus genes combined once again , claimed another million lives . \nIn both cases , the impact was minimized by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccines available . \n`` Now , every year , around summer time , a group of flu experts get together and see what strains are circulating so they can design an appropriate vaccine , '' says Dr Markel . \nAnd in the last few years , principally because of the global concern about avian flu , anti-viral drugs that target influenza , such as Tamiflu , have been introduced . \nThe emergence of a virus that crosses a species barrier is extremely rare But Professor Markel points out that , despite having reached new levels of medical preparation , `` we live in a world of emerging infectious diseases '' . \n`` We have learned to take avian flu very seriously , and we have learned to take the animal kingdom very seriously , '' he says . \nBut in the rare event that a virus does develop that is able to cross the species barrier , he points out that the close proximity of domestic farm animals to humans provides an opportunity for human infection . \n`` Human beings travel farther and faster than ever before . \nAll of this means that we are set up for a potential epidemic or pandemic , '' concludes Professor Markel . \n`` We learn more every time , but the story of flu pandemics is still very much a story in progress .

Food and Agriculture Organisation 's chief veterinary officer , told Reuters . \nHe said the FAO had been trying unsuccessfully to reach Egyptian officials . \nPigs are mainly raised by Egypt 's Christian minority . \nIn a statement earlier on Wednesday , Health Minister Hatem el-Gabali said : `` It is decided to slaughter all swine herds present in Egypt , starting from today . '' \nCabinet spokesman Magdy Rady said Egypt would compensate farmers for their losses . \nRady said swine farms in Egypt were in poor condition and constituted a health hazard . \n`` That 's why people are really getting afraid , '' he told Reuters before the decision was taken . \nSwine flu has killed up to 159 people in Mexico and one in the United States , and cases have also been reported in Europe as well as in neighbouring Israel . \nEgypt has not reported any cases , but has stepped up monitoring at airports . \nEgypt has been harder hit by the H5N1 bird flu virus than any other country outside Asia . \nExperts have long feared the bird flu virus could mutate into a form that spreads easily among people , sparking a pandemic that could kill millions . \nEgypt has suffered a surge in human cases of bird flu this month even as the flu season nears an end . \nExperts say the culling of pigs is unlikely to have an impact on the spread of swine flu if it reaches the country via air travellers . \n`` I would n't say it is beneficial for swine flu . \nIt would be beneficial for the general hygiene ... Generally speaking , pigs can transmit many other diseases , '' Hussein Gezairy , regional director for the World Health Organization , told journalists . \nMona Aly Mehrez , director of the state-run Animal Welfare Research Institute , said Egypt had long wanted to move pigs away from urban centres as a precaution due to the bird flu threat . \nBut Rady said relocation , which would could six months , was not viable and Egypt wanted to remove even a theoretical risk . \nExperts say that it is technically possible but extremely unlikely that swine flu -- a mix of swine , human and avian flu -- could find a way to combine with H5N1 in Egypt to create yet another flu strain . \n-LRB- $ 1 = 5.6406 Egyptian pounds -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/h1n1_reuters/rsd/H1N1_reuters__2009-04-29__466.rsd.txt"}
{"txt": "WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - As leading U.S. senators discuss whether Congress should retroactively approve military operations in Libya , the Senate on Tuesday sidestepped a chance to reassert the war powers of Congress . \nThe Senate blocked a vote on a proposal by Rand Paul , a freshman senator and Tea Party Republican , aimed at reaffirming the constitutional authority of Congress to declare war . \nThe problem with Paul 's amendment , as seen by many members of the Democratic majority , was that it quoted then-Senator Barack Obama 's words from 2007 in what appeared to be an attempt to embarrass the Democratic president . \nBack in 2007 , Senator Obama told the Boston Globe `` the president does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- nation . '' \nPaul said he wanted the Senate to endorse Obama 's past words and thus establish that the president had overreached in authorizing the U.S. action in Libya last month without first obtaining Congress ' approval . \nPaul 's proposal was `` too cute by half , '' declared Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein on Tuesday after she joined other senators in voting to table it , 90-10 . \nPaul had trouble getting even his fellow Republicans to support his idea . \nSome said they did n't approve of where he had chosen to offer his war powers amendment -- on legislation to do with small businesses . \n`` I think we need to address Libya , when -LRB- that 's -RRB- the focus , '' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison , a Republican , after the vote . \nObama briefed leading members of Congress the day before launching attacks on Libya last month , but did not seek debate or vote in Congress , as some lawmakers say he should have . \nArticle I of the U.S. Constitution says Congress has the power to declare war . \nBut Article 2 says the president is `` Commander in Chief '' of the armed forces . \nThis has been a source of friction between the two branches for decades . \n`` I am amazed that this body does not take the time to debate whether we should be in Libya , '' Paul said on the Senate floor Tuesday . \n`` Some say we 'll debate it next week . \n...

{"txt": "President Obama 's oversight of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill may have been hampered by his relationship to BP , former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Sunday in the opening salvo of a verbal cage match with White House spokesman Robert Gibbs . \nAppearing on `` Fox News Sunday , '' Palin suggested that the White House is too cozy with the oil industry because of contributions to candidate Obama during the 2008 presidential race . \n`` I do n't know why the question is n't asked by the mainstream media and by others if there 's any connection with the contributions made to President Obama and his administration and the support by the oil companies to the administration , '' Palin , a Fox News Channel contributor , said on `` Fox News Sunday . '' \n`` If there 's any connection there to President Obama taking so doggone long to get in there , to dive in there , and grasp the complexity and the potential tragedy that we are seeing here in the Gulf of Mexico -- now , if this was President Bush or if this were a Republican in office who had n't received as much support even as President Obama has from B.P. and other oil companies , you know the mainstream media would be all over his case , '' she said . \n \nGibbs said he does n't think Palin was paying mucher attention to the Gulf oil spill during the 2008 presidential race . \n`` Sarah Palin was involved in that election but , I do n't think she was paying a whole lot of attention , '' Gibbs said on CBS ' `` Face the Nation . '' \n`` I 'm almost sure that the oil companies do n't consider the Obama administration a huge ally , '' he said , adding , `` My suggestion to Sarah Palin would be to get slightly more informed as to what 's going on in and around oil drilling in this country . '' \nPalin used Twitter shortly thereafter to respond to Gibbs . \n`` Obama is the top recipient of BP PAC & individual money over the past 20 years . \nDispute these facts , '' she wrote , linking to a Politico article citing campaign finance reporting showing more than $ 3.5 million given to candidates by BP since 1990 . \nThe largest single donation by BP -- $ 77,051 -- went to Obama . \nHowever , Palin did not point to another set of numbers reported by campaign watchdog , the Center for Responsive Politics , which showed the oil and gas industry overall contributed $ 2.4 million to John McCain 's 2008 presidential campaign while $ 898,000 went for Obama 's bid . \nThe Gulf oil spill began after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana on April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nAt least 6 million gallons of crude have spewed into the Gulf of Mexico since , though many scientists say it 's likely much more than that . \nGibbs said the Obama administration is doing whatever it can to work with BP to cap the spill , but BP has not been as transparent as it could be . \n`` We asked that a video feed be made public , and that took 10 days . \nWe are -- we have sent letters recently in order to get them to post their air and water quality data and to ensure that the dispersants that they 're spraying on top of the water and using it at a sub-sea level are the least toxic available , '' he said . \nBut Gibbs added that `` the president has told the team to spare nothing in trying to cap this well . '' \nGibbs said he did not think that the oil spill would be the administration 's `` Hurricane Katrina , '' which deeply wounded President George W. Bush 's second term . \nGibbs said the Obama administration is aggressively dealing with the aftermath of the spill . \n`` Well , I think if you look back at what happened in Katrina , the government was n't there to respond to what was happening . \nThat , quite frankly , was the problem , even tracking the hurricane for days and knowing fairly precisely where it was going to hit , '' Gibbs said . \n`` I think the difference in this case is , we were there immediately . \nWe have been there ever since . '' \nGibbs agreed that government and the oil companies do n't get into a cozy relationship . \n`` We have to regulate this industry . \nWe have to make sure that their safety standards are up to the very latest and highest standards whenever they do something like this , drilling in such a precious ecosystem as the Gulf of Mexico , '' Gibbs said . \nPalin too said she still supports offshore drilling , but also thinks oil companies need to be accountable for accidents . \n`` I am still a strong supporter of domestic energy supplies being extracted . \nHaving said that , these oil companies have got to be held accountable when there is any kind of lax and preventative measures to result in a tragedy like we 're seeing right now in the Gulf , '' she said . \nAs the administration continues to fight the perception that it has n't done enough to cap the gusher , three top Obama administration officials were returning to the Gulf Coast to monitor the spill response . \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa P. Jackson headed there to Louisiana on Sunday while Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were to lead a Senate delegation to the region on Monday to fly over affected areas and keep an eye on the response . \nObama also named a special independent commission to review what happened and the Justice Department has also been down on the scene to `` gather information '' though Gibbs would not say whether a criminal investigation is underway . \nMeanwhile , Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen , who 's leading the official response , said he understands the frustration . \n`` If anybody is frustrated with this response , I would tell them their symptoms are normal , because I 'm frustrated , too , '' Allen said . \n`` Nobody likes to have a feeling that you ca n't do something about a very big problem .

'' \nBut Syrian ruling party newspaper al-Baath is predictably defiant . \nIt says `` traitors , agents and mercenaries '' are mistaken if they think Syria will stop `` producing martyrs , brave and faithful men who are ready for sacrifice '' . \nAmong Syria 's non-Arab neighbors , Iranian hard-line conservative daily Qods says the appointment of a new defense minister , within two hours of the blast , `` points to signs of calm '' in Damascus . \nBut it warns that any collapse of the government `` will result in civil war '' . \nIran 's reformist daily Sharq acknowledges an `` unprecedented incident and a turning point '' . \nIt adds that Syrian opposition forces `` are trying to show that Kofi Annan 's ` Peace Plan ' is a failure '' . \nTurkish commentators are sombre . \nSyria is rapidly descending into civil war , says Taraf daily . \n`` Worse than that ...

The next wave of the flu is what we should prepare for . \nThis is the sort of irresponsible rubbish that is fuelling panic over the `` flying pig '' flu . \nIf the mortality rate was over 2 % it would be a the most serious form of pandemic for which the WHO recommends draconian action such as closing national boarders . \nIn publishing this incorrect information , you are saying that `` flying pig '' flu is already much , much worse than 1918 Spanish flu !!!!! As for a 98 % mortality from seasonal flu for those over 65 what utter crap . \nThis whole affair is revealing how scientifically and mathematically challenged journalists actually are . \nWe cant give all the blaim to the reporters , they only report what they are told . \nThere is hardly any concrete investigative reporting these days due to time restraints . \nWe all tend to lean on what is told is the supposedly truth , which is in many cases far from it . \nLook at how far this global warming issue has gone . \nAlthough we all agree that the problem is real , no one truely understands its cause and direction . . \nThere are less deaths from H1 N1 then from the ordinary flu that goes around every year . \nIt is anything but a pandemic . \nI am not sure why Who has called it a pandemic and it seem the rest of their numbers are off the charts as well . \nI have ever only had a flu shot once and after I was horribly sick . \nThe only reason I decided to get it was I was working with a large group of people . \nI am sorry I did get the bloody thing . \nOther then that I have never had one and have never gotten the flu and if I did it was so mild one would n't even have noticed . \nThe most I have ever really had is a mild cold . \nEverbody needs to back off with the `` journalists are horrible '' comments and look at the graphs again . \nThe estimated rates are NOT actual rates . \nThese are based upon the latest data and then projected , like any other probability . \nAlso , I totally agree with Judy H. Remember , not every country in the world has a viable , working health surveillance system . \nIt is guaranteed that there are more cases out there that we do n't know about . \nI would n't be surprised if there was a HIGHER mortality rate in certain populations . \nAlso , p emery is absolutely correct . \nWe have n't seen the full impact of this current outbreak yet . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters .

{"txt": "Scott Ritter was the former US marine captain tasked with finding Saddam Hussein 's weapons . \nNow , in this first detailed account , he reveals how the CIA plotted to use a UN weapons inspection to overthrow the Iraqi regime - and how fiasco turned to tragedy when it failed ` This is big , Scott , '' Moshe Ponkovsky said . \n`` We do n't share this with anyone . '' \nIsrael 's military intelligence was already assisting us at Unscom -LRB- the United Nations Special Commission , which ran the UN 's weapons inspections program in Iraq -RRB- by scrutinising the `` take '' from the American U-2 spy-plane flights over Iraq . \nIt had proved an unorthodox but fruitful relationship for Unscom : the Israeli analysts had proved far superior to the CIA 's . \nBut what I was now proposing to the Israelis was a dramatic expansion of this intelligence-sharing . \nI was asking Lieutenant Colonel Ponkovsky and his colleagues to accept tapes from a secret Unscom-British communications eavesdropping operation that we were planning in Baghdad itself . \nThe Israelis would process the data -LRB- ie , break any codes or ciphers the Iraqis might be using , and translate -RRB- , and analyze them to determine if there was anything useful for Unscom 's mandate of disarming Iraq . \nIt was an ambitious , and possibly dangerous , project , but I had the backing of Unscom 's senior executives - its chairman , the Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekus , his American deputy , state department official Charles Duelfer , and Russian arms control expert Nikita Smidovich . \nBy the end of January 1996 , the scheme was falling into place : Ponkovsky told me that his boss , director of military intelligence General Ya'alon , had given authorisation . \nJust one part of the jigsaw puzzle was missing : with Britain providing the intercept team , and Israel doing the analysis , that just left the Americans . \nEarlier that month , Duelfer had handed me a paper from the CIA containing a series of questions about Unscom 's communications intercept plan . \nUntil then , the CIA had been disdainful of Unscom as a tool for intelligence-gathering , but now they were getting interested . \nNot that I knew it at the time , but the hidden agenda was regime change . \nSteve Richter , the head of the CIA 's Near East Division , had decided that the CIA would extend a helping hand - as long as they could exploit Unscom 's work to further its plans for a coup against Saddam Hussein . \nThis newfound enthusiasm for Unscom was only confirmed when the CIA saw how weapons inspectors were increasingly gaining access to some of the most sensitive sites in Iraq , including bases belonging to the Special Republican Guard - Saddam 's personal bodyguard . \nThe CIA coup plan went like this : if Unscom inspections could somehow be used to trigger a crisis , that would create a pretext for a US military attack against the Special Republican Guard , then Saddam 's personal security force could be decapitated . \nThis would clear the way for the plotters , led by Mohammad Abdullah al-Shawani , a former commander of Iraqi Special Forces who had defected to Amman in Jordan and been recruited by the CIA , to make their move . \nBut I had no idea of the CIA 's ulterior motives for offering assistance when , on February 4 1996 , I greeted the British eavesdropping team as they arrived at Washington 's Dulles Airport to receive training and equipment from the CIA . \nThe five intercept operators , led by Gary , a short , fit man in his early 30s , would become known as the `` Special Collection Element '' -LRB- SCE -RRB- . \nThe Brits proved to be fast learners , and I was back in northern Virginia by mid-February , checking up on the preparation of the SCE team before escorting them to Bahrain and on to Baghdad . \nThe Iraqis , meanwhile , were well aware of the potential intelligence value of the access gained by the weapons inspectors . \nThe Iraqi secret service , the Mukhabarat , already maintained a unit dedicated to Unscom . \nThe Mukhabarat 's priority was to get sanctions lifted - Iraq 's number one national security priority . \nIts director had been told by Saddam Hussein himself that Iraq had disarmed , and no longer had any interest in developing any WMD capability . \nBut sanctions could not be lifted until Unscom inspectors reached that conclusion for themselves . \nSo the Mukhabarat 's objective was not to obstruct our work ; quite the reverse , they had an interest in getting the Iraqi experts who were our counterparts to cooperate . \nTheir problem was that these officials were petrified of the Special Security Organisation , run by Saddam 's son Qusay Hussein . \nIf their cooperation with Unscom was seen as compromising the regime 's security , the consequences for the individuals involved would have been brutal . \nBecause they regarded such locations as Special Republican Guard units as off-limits , the Special Security Organisation demanded early warning of any inspection effort targeting presidential security . \nAs a consequence , the Mukhabarat redoubled its efforts to penetrate Unscom - with outstanding success . \nFirst , electronic surveillance of our computers in Baghdad , Bahrain and New York was established . \nThen , with French technical assistance provided via the French economic liaison in Baghdad - whether by rogue element , or with official permission is still unknown - the Mukhabarat broke Unscom 's encryption system , so they could listen in on all `` secure '' phone calls between Baghdad and New York . \nWith their advance knowledge of Unscom 's plans , the Iraqis were able to pre-empt inspections at will . \nBy June 1996 , a new inspection , Unscom 150 , was getting under way . \nThe aim was to shed light on the Iraqi mechanism of concealment - specifically the role of the Special Security Organisation . \nThe paramilitary wing of the CIA was taking an extraordinary interest in Unscom 150 . \nA man I knew as Moe Dobbs , a former American weapons inspector who was in fact a senior officer in the CIA 's covert operations Special Activities Staff -LRB- SAS -RRB- , had assigned three men to provide logistics and communications support for the team . \nIn retrospect this was suspicious , but at the time I was just grateful to get the help we so badly needed . \nSmidovich and I put together an inspection plan , which had us `` squeezing '' Special Republican Guard facilities in the Baghdad area . \nWith Israeli help , I had found the location of every Special Republican Guard unit around the capital . \nStrangely , Dobbs and the SAS objected to one of these targets - a barracks belonging to the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Brigade . \n`` There 's nothing there , '' Dobbs said . \n`` We 've checked it out . '' \nWe dropped it from our list . \nWhile we were busy planning our inspection , the CIA 's Iraq Operations Group had dispatched a special team of agents to its Amman Station to coordinate coup planning with the Iraqi National Accord -LRB- INA -RRB- , a group of Iraqi expatriates led by a former Ba'athist official , Iyad Alawi , whom Richter had brought together with al-Shawani . \nThe White House was under political pressure to be seen to be doing something about Iraq . \nWhen the CIA said they had a plan - the `` Silver Bullet '' coup - to get rid of Saddam Hussein , the White House approved it . \nOf course , there was a political dimension : the upcoming presidential elections in November 1996 . \nTony Lake , the national security adviser to President Clinton , was sensitive to any possibility of an `` October Surprise '' and , in private discussions with CIA director John Deutch -LRB- denied by both Deutch and Lake , but acknowledged by many CIA insiders -RRB- , ordered that the coup be wrapped up by early summer . \nThe only problem was that this coup , supposedly planned in great secrecy , was well known to the Iraqi government . \nMany of the defectors being used by the CIA were actually Mukhabarat double agents . \nThen , through a series of tragic mistakes , the Mukhabarat took control of one of the CIA 's secure satellite communications units used by the INA to communicate with the plotters in Baghdad . \nSo the Mukhabarat learned every detail of the plan - including the fact that the CIA was linking the timing of the coup with the Unscom inspection in early June . \nWhen the Unscom 150 team arrived in Baghdad on June 10 1996 under the watchful , if somewhat hostile , stares of our Iraqi minders , Rolf Ekus and the rest of Unscom were completely unaware of the CIA 's ulterior motive . \nOn the very first day , one team was prevented from inspecting a Special Republican Guard barracks in Abu Ghraib . \nThe following day , another group set out for the headquarters of 1st Brigade , SRG . \nThe Iraqis were having none of that either , and Unscom 150 found itself in a stand-off with automatic-rifle-wielding SRG troopers . \nThe Security Council reacted to Baghdad 's non-cooperation by passing a new resolution , 1060 , which `` deplored '' the denial of access and demanded full cooperation . \nTwo days later , the inspectors were still parked in the sun . \nThe decision to send Ekus to Iraq was , on the surface , curious . \nClearly , had the US still wanted to bomb Iraq , they would have pushed harder for a finding of `` material breach '' . \nThe truth was that this sudden U-turn - renewed American support for diplomacy - was driven by the fact that the CIA coup plot was collapsing around them . \nWhile Unscom 150 was parked out front of the Special Republican Guard facilities , the CIA station in Amman was desperately trying to contact the ringleaders of the coup in Baghdad . \nBut their entire network was silent . \nIt was as if they had disappeared off the face of the earth . \nIn reality , Saddam 's intelligence service had so thoroughly infiltrated the plot that there was n't a single CIA-controlled asset left in Iraq who had not been arrested by the Mukhabarat . \nFor the Iraqi leadership there was a clear case for terminating all contact with Unscom , but the Mukhabarat 's Unscom cell had convinced Tariq Aziz and others , including Saddam , that Unscom was being used and was not a witting player in the coup attempt . \nThe Iraqis knew economic sanctions could not be lifted without a favourable report on compliance from Unscom ; Ekus promised to work hard to this end , but needed help . \nOn June 22 , Ekus and Tariq Aziz signed what became known as the `` Agreement for the Modalities of Sensitive Site Inspections '' , which governed how Unscom would go about inspecting sites belonging to Republican Guard , Special Republican Guard , Special Security Organisation , Mukhabarat and other security institutions . \nEkus had done his job - averting a war , while keeping weapons inspections on track . \nThe ramifications of the collapsed coup had yet to sink in . \nAny remaining hopes within the CIA were quashed when , on June 26 , the Agency 's Amman station allegedly received a transmission from one of their secure satellite phones . \nOn the line was the Mukhabarat , who told astonished CIA agents that the game was up . \nWithin days the CIA team in Amman vanished . \nThe US had witnessed a covert action fiasco of a kind not seen since the Bay of Pigs in 1961 . \nSaddam 's security services had rounded up more than 800 suspected plotters , most of whom were tortured and executed . \nAll traces of the CIA 's involvement in a coup plot against Saddam were eliminated . \nIt was the last time I , or anyone in Unscom , saw Moe Dobbs and his colleagues . \nMeanwhile , I was anxious for an opportunity to put the new agreement to the test . \nOn June 24 , I got it - in the form of a CIA-provided photograph that showed a gathering of vehicles outside a Special Republican Guard site on the southern tip of Saddam International Airport , which I labeled `` Site 1a '' . \nSCE intercepts of Iraqi minder communications showed that , at the time the U-2 photograph was taken , the Iraqis wanted to know where every inspector was - arousing our suspicion of ongoing concealment activity . \nThis made `` 1a '' an ideal candidate for testing the `` sensitive site modalities '' . \nLess than a month later , we formed up outside the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre . \nAt the initial Special Republican Guard checkpoint just on the edge of Saddam International Airport , the two convoys - Iraqi and Unscom - linked up and proceeded down the road . \nWe passed through the next two Special Republican Guard checkpoints without problems . \nBut then , as we closed in on Site 1a , we came to a new checkpoint , and these guards were n't playing around . \nTaking up positions in a horseshoe pattern , they aimed loaded rifles , machine guns and grenade launchers at our convoy . \nSuddenly , a vehicle arrived in front of us , on the other side of the checkpoint . \nTwo officers stepped out , took a quick look at the situation , and barked some orders . \nThe gate was opened and we moved on . \nTo our left was the southern edge of Saddam International Airport , and to our right a lush game park with several different species of gazelle and antelope - Saddam 's personal stock for his kitchen . \nFinally , we reached the compounds of Site 1a . \nAs soon as the inspection began , I understood why the Iraqis were so nervous about our presence here . \nThe eastern compound was , as we thought , affiliated with the Special Republican Guard . \nBut it was n't just any SRG unit - it was Saddam 's personal bodyguard , the Radwaniyah Platoon , 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion . \nThis unit was equipped with shiny silver Mercedes sedans , parked in a line under a covered lot . \nTwo of the cars had tarpaulins over them , which , when pulled back , showed the effects of an earlier ambush . \nOne had been riddled with machine-gun bullets , shattering the bullet-proof windows and penetrating the armored doors . \nThe occupants of the second car had gone through an even more terrifying experience : it had obviously been struck by a rocket-propelled grenade . \nOtherwise , it was a standard military barracks , but a search of files turned up something that caught my attention : an emergency administrative notice , declaring that the 3rd Battalion -LRB- Special Forces -RRB- , Special Republican Guard , was `` liquidated '' , and all its members were placed on administrative leave pending further notice . \nThe 3rd Battalion had been the unit singled out by Dobbs and the CIA as being off-limits for inspection during Unscom 150 . \nI now realized what this meant : `` Stay away , those are our guys . '' \nReading of their fate , I felt sick to my stomach . \nOn my way home through London , I again took advantage of a layover at Heathrow to pay a visit to the Defense Intelligence Staff , which had provided Gary and his colleagues for Unscom 's Special Collection Element in Baghdad . \nI was unshaven and dressed in jeans , with the desert dust of Iraq still in the crevices of my hiking boots . \nI looked very rough , but this was just a social visit , a chance to get a quick bite to eat with friends . \nOr so I thought . \nThe door to the director 's office opened , and the director himself walked out , a tall man with a broad smile and firm handshake . \n`` Please join us , will you ? \nWe have something we want you to read and comment on . '' \nInside the folder I was handed was a lengthy report , classified top secret , and containing several US codewords I was familiar with . \nThe subject line read : `` UN COMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPT OPERATION UP AND RUNNING IN BAGHDAD . '' \nI glanced down at the list of addressees . \nThis document had been sent around the world , to every embassy and military headquarters the US maintained . \nThis was more than just giving people a heads-up about our SCE operation . \nThis was blowing its cover to smithereens . \n`` The Yanks seemed to have sent it everywhere except Tariq Aziz 's own office , '' remarked a Ministry of Defense official . \nVery few people in London knew about the operation . \nAnd now all the details , including the real names of the personnel involved , had been broadcast around the world . \n`` We would like your opinion on this matter , '' said the director . \nI did n't hesitate . \n`` Clearly we have to take the best interests of the SCE team itself first . \nThis report represents a compromise of their security , which is unacceptable . \nFrom an Unscom point of view , we must cease the SCE operation immediately . '' \nWhether done on purpose or accident , the American publication of the sensitive details of a covert British intelligence operation , operating under Unscom cover , was an incomprehensible act . \nThe US had killed the SCE , so now we had nothing specific to go on . \nWe needed high-quality intelligence , without which weapons inspections were going nowhere . \nI had tried my best to develop sources of information , but had been sabotaged by the CIA . \nThe failed June 1996 coup attempt had largely been determined by domestic American political considerations . \nLike President George HW Bush before him , Clinton and his political handlers were sensitive to public perception in a presidential election year . \nThis shaped both the coup 's mission -LRB- get Saddam -RRB- and its timing -LRB- early summer , before the Republicans had nailed down their candidate -RRB- . \nNot only was the 1996 plot chiefly a `` wag the dog '' scenario , but once again , any chance of Iraq disarming under UN supervision had been cynically undermined by the larger US objective of regime change Ritter discovered that the barracks there belonged to the Radwaniyah Platoon - Saddam 's personal bodyguard , equipped with a fleet of silver Mercedes sedans . \nTwo of these cars were badly damaged by machine-gun fire and rocket attack - evidence of a recent assassination attempt on senior regime officials . \nThe mystery of the 3rd Battalion This U-2 photograph , provided by the CIA , was taken on June 11 1996 , just as Ritter 's Unscom 150 weapons inspection was getting under way . \nWhile searching the barracks here , Ritter found files declaring that the 3rd Battalion -LRB- Special Forces -RRB- of the Special Republican Guard had been liquidated and its members placed on `` administrative leave '' . \nRitter recalled that the 3rd Battalion had earlier been placed `` off limits '' by the CIA . \n`` I now realized what this meant : ` Stay away , those are our guys ' . '' \nThe sensitivity of Site 1a led to prolonged stand-offs between weapons inspectors and Iraqi soldiers . \nIntelligence gathered from Unscom 's covert listening post in Baghdad suggested that the vehicles may have been used to move material and documents they did not wish inspectors to find . \nThis is an edited extract from Iraq Confidential : The Untold Story of America 's Intelligence Conspiracy , by Scott Ritter , with foreword by Seymour Hersh , published by IB Tauris Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Scott Ritter on failed CIA plot to overthrow the Saddam Hussein 's regime using UN weapons inspection This article appeared on p8 of the G2 section of the Guardian on 01.25 BST on Wednesday 28 September 2005 The latest news and comment from our team of reporters , writers and editors in the US Auto update every minute On | Off Busfield : `` Beagles come in 2 sizes 13 inch and 15 inch . \nLike a MacBook Pro '' says @Mister_Solomon : Westminster Dog Show - live !

{"txt": "A housing bubble bursting , banks faltering toward failure , a nation plunging into recession . \nThe year was 1991 , and the Swedish government responded with a dramatic plan : Unpaid loans and other troubled assets would be dumped into new state-owned banks , scrubbing the banking industry of problems in the hope of sparking a lending revival . \nU.S. government officials now are considering a similar plan to address the simmering financial crisis , part of a broader discussion about ways to revamp a federal rescue effort that has helped curb panic but failed to slow bank losses or increase lending . \nThe idea of creating a `` bad bank '' to quarantine troubled assets is one of several approaches being considered , but it has gained momentum among President-elect Barack Obama 's economic advisers and banking regulators . \nWith all of the approaches , there could be hitches : Several senior officials suggested that the government is likely to need more than the roughly $ 320 billion remaining in the financial rescue program . \nThe renewed focus on toxic assets completes a trip around the block for the government 's rescue efforts . \nIn October , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. persuaded Congress to allocate $ 700 billion toward a financial rescue by describing a plan in which the government would buy troubled assets from banks . \nInstead , they chose to focus on direct capital investments . \nThe investments helped some banks endure through autumn , but bank losses have continued to grow , threatening to overwhelm the government 's support and preventing the banks from finding private investors . \nThe government was forced to fashion a pair of ad-hoc bailouts for Citigroup in November and Bank of America on Friday . \n`` A continuing barrier to private investment in financial institutions is the large quantity of troubled , hard-to-value assets that remain on institutions ' balance sheets , '' Bernanke said last week . \n`` The presence of these assets significantly increases uncertainty about the underlying value of these institutions and may inhibit both new private investment and new lending . '' \nThe government could engage in direct purchases of troubled assets , but doing so would require an enormous amount of money to buy a meaningful volume . \nAnother option under consideration is guaranteeing to limit losses on portfolios of troubled loans , as the government has done for Bank of America and Citigroup . \nBut officials are loath to hammer out deals with one bank after another . \nCreating a bad bank is viewed as the most comprehensive approach . \nIt is also a simple , understandable solution to a complicated problem , an important consideration in confronting what is ultimately a crisis of confidence . \nBut a bad bank has never been tried on this scale , nor with assets as complicated as those held by U.S. banks . \nBad banks are generally formed to deal with failed banks . \nAnd in almost every prior case , the cost to the government has been significant . \nThe idea has generated interest among key Democrats . \n`` It 's something I am very interested in , but I 'd have to see the cost , '' said Sen. Charles Schumer -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- , chairman of the joint economic committee . \nOne precedent for the discussions is the Resolution Trust Corp. , created by the government in 1989 to dispose of assets from the savings and loan industry . \nThe RTC eventually liquidated about $ 400 billion in assets , at an estimated cost to the government of about $ 125 billion . \nThe RTC is widely viewed as successful because it helped curb the crisis .

'' \nAiding the opposition is also complicated , officials said , because of the lack of clarity about the capability , motives and strength of the disparate groups comprising the opposition . \nWhite House and State Department officials said Friday that even though the opposition is arming itself and fighting the government , that does not entitle Gadhafi to fight his own people . \nGadhafi , officials said , lost his legitimacy when his forces fired on innocent protesters . \n`` It is the people of Libya that are forced to defend themselves in light of the aggression that the Libyan regime has carried on , not just a military forces , but by these mercenaries that are in the employment of Colonel Gadhafi , '' State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said . \n`` The unrest is aimed at ending his rule , his oppressive and violent rule , and we believe that that would result in a more peaceful Libya and would allow the Libyan people to take the kind of steps that they want to take towards a representative democratic government that addresses their legitimate grievances and respects their aspirations , '' said White House spokesman Jay Carney . \nEarlier in the week , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the situation demands `` a strong and strategic American response .

DHABI\\/HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP boss Tony Hayward met with an Abu Dhabi state investment fund on Wednesday , part of a quest for cash to ward off takeovers and help pay for the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nThe action on Thursday was set to move back to the courts with the oil drilling industry going head-to-head with the Obama administration over the White House effort to suspend deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for six months in the wake of the catastrophic well blowout . \n-LRB- nN07171381 -RRB- Hayward , BP 's chief executive , was seen by Reuters with a senior official from another Abu Dhabi fund , and a report said Saudi investors were looking to buy 10 percent to 15 percent of the British oil company . \nA United Arab Emirates official said Hayward 's visit with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority -LRB- ADIA -RRB- was a routine one . \nAn ADIA spokesman declined comment . \n`` We are here to talk to our existing shareholders , '' a cheerful-looking Hayward told Reuters in the ornate , marble lobby of an Abu Dhabi office building before heading into a meeting , along with his six-man entourage . \nBut bankers say BP is on a marketing drive for its stock , whose price has fallen by half since its well blew out in April , spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico and soiling the shores of every U.S. Gulf Coast state . \nHayward was in Azerbaijan on Tuesday . \nBP 's shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed up almost 4 percent , buoyed by investor relief the company had said it does not plan to issue new equity , and speculation the worst is behind for what they see as an underpriced energy giant . \n`` With the CEO in Abu Dhabi speaking to the sovereign wealth fund to get some investment , it 's not surprising that there is some enthusiasm in the market for BP shares , '' said Mic Mills , head of electronic trading at London-based ETX Capital . \nProgress on the relief well , seen as the best hope for finally stopping the 79-day-old disaster , also lifted investor hearts . \nThe U.S. official overseeing the spill cleanup said it was 15 feet from the side of the leaking well , although still not expected to be finished before mid-August . \nThe spill is wreaking havoc on coastal ecosystems , killing birds , sea turtles and dolphins and risking multibillion-dollar fishing and tourist industries at a time of high unemployment . \nAs a result , it sits atop U.S. President Barack Obama 's crowded domestic agenda and has sternly tested his leadership . \nOn Thursday , the next big round will play out in court in the fight between the drilling industry and the White House over its efforts to suspend offshore drilling . \nGiven the business and environmental stakes , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans is expected to rule quickly , after a rare one-hour oral argument , on whether deepwater drilling should be temporarily halted again . \nA federal judge , also in New Orleans , lifted the moratorium last month after Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc argued it was arbitrary because it was a blanket ban on all new drilling in depths below 500 feet . \nThe Obama administration appealed the decision , defending the suspension as needed to provide time to probe the BP oil spill 's cause and ensure other drilling rigs operate safely . \nThe administration is seeking a stay of the judge 's ruling at the hearing , slated for 3 p.m. local time -LRB- 2000 GMT -RRB- on Thursday . \nThe industry calls it an unnecessary infringement on its business that costs jobs . \nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration said the ban will reduce crude output an average of 82,000 barrels per day , more than previously estimated . \nBP 's Alaska unit said on Wednesday it will probably delay until 2011 development drilling at its offshore Liberty field . \nIt had been due to start late this year . \nA successful court challenge `` could give some of these -LRB- drillers ' -RRB- stocks a lift in the near term , '' said Channing Smith , co-portfolio manager of Tulsa , Oklahoma-based Capital Advisors Growth Fund . \nThe Philadelphia oil services sector index is down about 25 percent from its 2010 high hit in late April . \nThe European Union 's energy chief said in Brussels that the bloc should consider its own moratorium on new deepwater oil drilling until after a probe into the BP spill . \nEstimates of the leak 's severity vary widely , to as high as 100,000 barrels per day . \nA new collection vessel that should more than double BP 's oil-capture capacity to 53,000 barrels a day from around 25,000 is projected to take three more days to hook up , as rough seas hamper efforts to finish the job . \nWith the region settling into the six-month hurricane season , forecasters were watching a weather system over the southern Gulf that could develop into a tropical depression and hit the coast near the Texas-Mexico border on Thursday . \nPushed by the Obama administration , BP has committed to a $ 20 billion fund for clean-up and other costs stemming from the spill . \nIts costs to date have topped $ 3 billion . \nThe final bill may depend on how much crude pours from the well , which blew when a rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers . \nSo containment efforts are keenly watched . \nBP executives have held talks with sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi , Kuwait , Qatar and Singapore , seeking a partner that might help it avoid being taken over , a UAE source said . \nAbu Dhabi 's International Petroleum Investment Company , was not interested in buying a BP stake , a company source said . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe first target is to concentrate power to close that oil hole far 1500 meters from surface ships . \nWhat is happening seems a slow rallenty of eleven september2001 tragedy . \nI 'm crying every hour with my child -LRB- five years -RRB- for what is happening in Louisiana . \nI tried to communicate in every manner my technical ideas to somebody who wants really stop the leak . \ni tried to send emails with drawings of plug with steel plate crown around TO horizon support ... coast guard ... @uscg . \nmil ; and horizon support , The first reason of this accident should be bad maintainance of systems and eccessive pressures than preventived , then no gas tight and electrical problems ... . \nit is not thje first time . \nBut I am quite sure that the real criminal act of BP is their intention to continue to collect oil instead to stop it definitely and then drill again . \n... But as now we can program the positive act to close the leak completely : It is easy to be closed when the bottom area around this hole is free from interference objects : solution is to clean the area with the power of us coast guards and us navy . \nThe removal of all piping interferences and strange inventions to have an horizontal and clean area around the hole . \nThe column of water above this hole is 150 atm of pressure and can be used on a crown steel horizontal plate welded around a below positioned plug . \nThe pressure of water is on a steel larger area pushing on the bottom around the hole and the pressure from gas\\/oil is on the plug only . \nLike a cap `` sombrero '' . \nThis is enough to close this hole . \nWhithout losses of money and energies of great men who are fighting against effects of the oil invasion . \nPlease understand this simple concept which is not be taken in consideration enough . \nI am still confused if the pressure of oil coming out from the hole is more than 100 psi and the blow up was due to the pressure how then drilling a relief hole can be safeguarded so that we do not have another problem like the earlier one . \nCan someone kindly explain Jul 07 , 2010 6:50 am EDT -- Report as abuse This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-07-07__1263.rsd.txt"}

{"txt": "Massive dome lowered at site of huge U.S. oil spill ROBERT , Louisiana | Fri May 7 , 2010 7:40 pm EDT ROBERT , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc engineers using undersea robots maneuvered a massive metal chamber to fit over a gushing ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico on Friday in their best chance yet to contain a leak that threatens an environmental catastrophe on U.S. shores . \nThe four-story structure , the best short-term hope of controlling the spewing crude , was lowered to the seabed almost one mile below the surface in an attempt to funnel the escaping oil to a surface tanker . \nBP , which faces major financial losses from the spill , suffered a further blow when ratings agency Standard & Poor 's lowered its outlook on the British oil giant to negative from stable . \nIt is under pressure from the Obama administration to limit the damage from what could be the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nBP has said it will pay all legitimate costs , a bill that is likely to run into the billions of dollars . \nBP officials hope the container will begin funneling oil from the leak next week . \nWorkers will spend the next three to four days making the connections to pump crude to the surface . \nThe device has not been tried at that depth , where engineers guiding remotely operated vehicles battle darkness , currents and intense undersea pressure . \nBP Chief Executive Tony Hayward warned there was no certainty of success . \n`` The pressures and temperatures are very different here , so we can not be confident that it will work , '' Hayward told CNN . \nBP is drilling a relief well to halt the leak -- which began after the Deepwater Horizon exploded on April 20 , killing 11 crew members -- but it could take up to three months to complete . \nEngineers have also considered pumping heavy fluids into the top of the failed blowout preventer to plug the leaking well in a technique called `` top kill . '' \nThey gave up on efforts to close valves on a failed blowout preventer with underwater robots , after trying in vain for two weeks , Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said . \nSurface containment efforts continue , helped by calm seas . \nControlled burns on Thursday removed up to 9,000 barrels -LRB- 280,000 gallons\\/1 ,070,000 liters -RRB- of oil , he said . \nIt `` is a very powerful technique and when the weather is good it will continue , '' Suttles said . \nForecasts suggest light winds through Saturday , although they are expected shift and come from the south to southwest , which could push the slick toward the Louisiana shore . \nAbout 250 boats deployed protective booms and used dispersants to break up the thick oil on Friday . \nCrews have laid almost 800,000 feet of boom , and spread 267,000 gallons -LRB- 1 million liters -RRB- of chemical dispersant . \nOn Thursday , after meeting with BP executives in Houston , U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said the company and its partners made `` some very major mistakes . '' \nSalazar reiterated the U.S. government will issue no new offshore drilling permits until an inter-agency panel gives a safety review to President Barack Obama by May 28 . \nIn the meantime , current drilling will continue . \nStandard & Poor 's , in announcing the negative outlook , indicated a ratings downgrade was likely . \nMoody 's said the spill raised the specter of credit pressure for the five primary companies involved in the project . \nS&P cut its outlook for Anadarko Petroleum Corp , which has a 25 percent stake in the ill-fated well , to stable from positive , saying it is `` potentially liable for significant costs and liabilities relating to the clean-up .

{"txt": "Economic Crisis : Some Are Guilty All Are Responsible Well , I guess the conservative philosophy of `` faith '' in free markets that has dominated America for the past 28 years since Ronald Reagan and which was adopted by the religious `` right '' as if it was gospel has now been revealed to be what classic religious teaching would call idolatry . \nAnd I guess mistrust of government , another conservative article of `` faith '' , has turned out to be one of those morally relative judgments now that private financial institutions need bailing out . \nAnd I guess the basic religious and spiritual notions of accountability and taking responsibility have been annulled with regard to financial leaders and their institutions that need to be `` saved '' . \nAnd clearly the core obligations the powerful and affluent have to care for the vulnerable and poor are secondary to the `` commandment '' to rescue the wealthy . \nAnd there are the people who have been at the heart of the crisis - the people whose greed has led to the collapse of the financial system and the unprecedented collapse in the middle class and the middle and middle class . \nAnytime a society has millions of people lose their homes and jobs , major institutions disappear over night , and its citizens experience unprecedented levels of insecurity , uncertainty , and anxiety about the future there is a moral issue with moral implications . \nOf course , the first round of reaction we can expect is the typical low-level blame game between Republicans and Democrats , liberals and conservatives , free market economists and interventionists , supply-siders and Keynesians , and the poor and middle and wealthy classes . \nBut no great moral or spiritual insight is required to know that the moral failure that has led to our present crisis is as old as human beings - in a word GREED and it would be far too easy for any `` us '' to simply blame some other `` them '' and thereby deflect and project our responsibility on someone else . \nAnd there are many of `` us '' . \nThere are the hundred or so people at the head of each of these `` stalwart '' financial institutions whose greed led to decisions all along the way which destroyed their institutions . \nThere are the brilliant and innovative financiers , who developed incredibly complex investment vehicles which were supposed to spread risk , whose greed actually blinded them to risk as they and their investors `` earned '' ungodly sums of money . \nThere are the politicians on both sides of the aisle who failed in their roles as servants , representatives , and protectors of the people whose greed to maintain their power kept them from telling their constituents the truth that not everyone can own a home and limited their ability to tell their powerful supporters that regulations that had been gutted under President Clinton were indeed needed . \nThere are the nine federal agencies responsible for overseeing some part of the mortgage market and there are the real estate brokers whose greed inspired them to break every `` rule '' in seducing people with mortgages that were beyond buyer 's means . \nAnd then there is us : regular Main Street American home owners whose greed compelled us to take on mortgages -LRB- or second mortgages -RRB- that we knew were too good to be true in order to support consumption well beyond our means . \nEvery religious and spiritual wisdom tradition suggests that great moments of collective trauma or suffering are also invitations - not for flight -LRB- turning inwards to simply protect ourselves -RRB- or fight -LRB- blaming others -RRB- - but to honestly self-reflect , introspect , and grow . \nObviously , some people are guiltier than others for this economic crisis but in an interdependent reality all are responsible . \nFrom a religious or psycho-spiritual perspective we begin a genuine and healthy process of reconstruction and renewal when each of us , wherever we are on the continuum of `` power '' and `` influence '' is prepared to ask : What did I do that may have contributed to where we collectively find ourselves ? \nWhat personal responsibility do I have for what is happening ? \nIn what ways did I buy into an economic model completely built upon greater and greater consumption - a system in which our ever expanding desires far too easily are turned into needs ? \nHow has my understanding of happiness and success -LRB- getting , amassing , having , and consuming more and more -RRB- distorted my values and fed my greed ? \nHow much did I hide myself from the truth I knew deep down - that something was wrong as there is no easy credit in life : credit needs to be merited earned . \nYes , there has been serious moral failure that has led to this economic wreckage and moral failure requires accountability . \nAccountability begins with ourselves and then and only then can legitimately be extended outwards to those who do in fact carry greater responsibility . \nSo let 's start to rebuild our social contract which has been eroded by the age old vice of greed . \nNot by descending into a blame game but by each of us seriously asking ourselves three simple moral questions : What did I do to help get us to this place ? \nWhat do I need to change with regard to my own behavior ? \nWhat can I do to help the most vulnerable of my fellow citizens - those who more hurt and vulnerable than I am - and there is always someone more vulnerable than we are ? \n-LRB- For those who enjoy a Biblical reference : Where are you ? \nand Where is your brother ? -RRB- \nAnd let 's stop having faith in the economy and begin to have faith in each other - trusting that the happiness that comes from greed is transient at best while the happiness that comes from giving , serving and even sacrificing for each other is far more enduring and credit-worthy . \nThe reason why we are in this FINANCIAL MESS is because all those holes came into play at full throttle . \nSome people simply abused the weakness of the dollar for their benefit . \nUpon seeing the weakness of the dollar , they played up the price of oil . \nThey can do it because as we have seen last Monday , there is no regulation that can stop them from doing so . \nWith very high oil prices , the companies become vulnerable and weak . \nHere comes the SHORT SELLERS taking advantage of that weakness and betted that the stock prices of these companies would fail . \nAs a result of stocks plunging , many companies struggled and many could have borrowed money from banks and in the process raised the interest rates . \nAlso , profits from short selling contribute to excess liquidity and to offset this liquidity , interest rates are raised . \nAs interest rates climbed , so does the mortgage interest rates . \nMany homeowners defaulted which put banks on a tough situation . \nAgain the SHORT SELLERS saw the opportunity to profit so they came BETTING AGAINST the banks until we see all these big banks failed . \nNow , we can see that there are THREE BIG SUCKING HOLES that came into play that put us into this mess . \nThe FIRST are the SPECULATORS who played up THE PRICE OF OIL . \nThe SECOND are SHORT SELLERS which pulled down the stock market . \nThe resulting HOLE -LRB- third hole -RRB- which these two sucking holes created are the FORECLOSED houses which continue to burden the financial system . \nThe SOLUTION to this mess is simply to PLUG UP these THREE HOLES . \nFirst is to create an OIL PRICE STABILIZATION LAW which I explained in my earlier posts . \nSecond is to PERMANENTLY BAN SHORT SELLERS . \nThirdly , if they want a bailout , it should be used to relieve the homeowners by lowering their mortgage interest payments and return the foreclosed houses to its previous owners under a restructured payment scheme that 's affordable . \nThe third solution will release the banks from bad debt and can therefore continue and start clean anew . \nThe hedgefunds which will be affected by the ban on short selling can look for MORE PRODUCTIVE investments like the manufacturing sectors and new technologies sectors . \nThis shift of investment would lower interest rates because manufacturers would not be crowding in the banks for loans . \nThis will also make our manufacturing sectors competitive . \nAs a result more jobs will be created . \nThis is WIN-ALL SCENARIO and to achieve this , THESE THREE HOLES MUST BE ATTENDED TO , otherwise , NO BAILOUT WILL SUCCEED . \nThe reason why the U.S economy is so vulnerable to Wall Street speculation is because of SHORT SELLING . \nThe economists DO NOT REALIZE that these people -LRB- short sellers -RRB- are like PRINTING MONEY UNHINDERED . \nEarning money at the expense of others -LRB- short selling -RRB- is NOT EARNING BUT STEALING . \nIt 's the same reason why we ca n't print money freely because it is tantamount to stealing . \nUNLESS the regulators BAN THIS SHORT SELLING IN THE STOCK MARKET , Americans will continue to SUFFER ECONOMICALLY as what is happening now . \nThe ENEMIES of America does not need an airplane to crash to our buildings . \nThey only need to PLAY UP THE OIL PRICE IN THE STOCK MARKET and then start BETTING ON THE OTHER STOCKS TO FAIL thru SHORT SELLING . \nNot only can they ruin the economy of America , but they can also make themselves rich by doing so . \nNOW WHERE ARE THE BRAINS OF OUR LEADERS AND ANALYSTS ? \nBAN SHORT-SELLING AND IMPLEMENT THAT OIL PRICE STABILIZATION MECHANISM NOW and all will be well again . \nThat 700 billion dollar bail-out should be used to relieve American homeowners by lowering their mortgage interest rates and those who already lost their homes should be asked to return with their payments restructured . \nWe have seen how the price of oil jumped 16 points in just one day for no valid reason . \nIt 's very clear that the government -LRB- both Congress and the executive branch -RRB- has NOT DONE anything to rein-in speculators . \nIt is therefore NOT farfetched that oil would rise up again to an all time high as before . \nI hope they would now legislate a bill that would rein-in the STUPIDITY of these speculators . \nOil has been the lifeblood of world economy and people should not be allowed to play on this commodity . \nIt 's very clear that the speculators are not using their minds . \nThey do not understand that they are slowly hanging themselves as the price of oil shoots up to where the economy can not perform anymore . \nTheir money would be deemed useless if there would be a work stoppage worldwide . \nI hope Congress would make a law that would put a price cap on oil everytime speculators are playing with it . \nIf the price of oil today -LRB- Monday -RRB- is 120 dollars per barrel , the price cap tomorrow -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- should be 120 dollars per barrel . \nSince it can not go up that price , there would be massive panic selling which would pull down it 's price . \nIf the price of oil closes at 110 dollars tomorrow -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- , the price cap should be set at 110 dollars per barrel on Wednesday . \nThere is no way to go for the price of oil but DOWN if this mechanism would be put into place . \nOnce the oil price reaches a SANE LEVEL of maybe about 90 dollars , regulators can then SWITCH-OFF that mechanism so it can settle to it 's true value . \nThere must be a body that can switch that mechanism on or off as the need requires . \nWe NEED THAT MECHANISM NOW AND CONGRESS SHOULD ACT NOW BEFORE THESE IDIOTIC SPECULATORS WOULD HAMMER THE ECONOMY AGAIN . \nThe foundation of the capitalism is the selfish human nature , and the stock market , while drawing out capitals otherwise tucked under beds , is in fact to encourage one rob millions with a few key punches in the cubicle of a merry and innocent-looking glass building without seeing a pain-twisted face or hearing an anguish cry of the robbed , and without awakening the warm-hearted animal of guilt in shallow and uneasy sleep . \nYes , someone could follow your advice , have a profound reflection , and become a saint . \nBut at most the society gains one hermetic eccentric , a laughable nuisance , a sore loser in the eyes of people swimming along the mainstream . \nThe cruel joke is that , no matter where he hides , he ca n't escape from being robbed , because the wealth of the world is re-distributed with every key stroke of the Wall Street traders if Warren Buffet makes $ 1 billion today , we each must in some way contribute unless we count consumer confidence as commodity . \nThe saddest casualty of the capitalist triumph is the total collapse of sense of care in health care . \nAs health care is put on price-tags in the market like a smuggled girl in a red district , all the human compassion is striped bare and `` care '' becomes a misnomer : all but a few people are in it for the money and the sick are no more than milking cows . \nThe intricate healthcare market makes the concept of care almost hypocritical ; doctors , administrators , and everyone else could all let loose of their greedy instincts in pursuing the green bills without any moral afflictions , because , in the open market , they never directly take money from the sick and frail they take `` care '' of . \nDoctors simply demand more from insurers and government what they deserve , and insurers demand more from the insured with all good reasons , government borrow more from China without worrying who will eventually pay . \nSo here is our market system that sugar-coat greed so perfectly and deliriously , until one day everything sinks into the global-warmed , elevated ocean . \n`` Then the Devil took him to Jerusalem , to the highest point of the Temple , and said , `` If you are the Son of God , jump off ! \nFor the Scriptures say , ` He orders his angels to protect you , and they will hold you with their hands to keep you from striking your foot on the stone . ' '' \nJesus responded , `` The Scriptures also say , ` Do not test the Lord your God . ' \nFacing Temptation is Human , not Spirit ? \nDo Humans test GOD or the Devil in their ` Flesh Temptations ' . \nWho is Ahead on Planet Earth in the Tests of Temptation , in the Human Race ? \nGOD or the Devil ? \nGOD , nor God , our Human Ancestors , tempt Humans . \nDevil Male Body Birth , Devil Flesh Lust does . \nHow do Misbred Humans Resist Flesh Lust ? \nIs it Time to Accept Who Humans are Serving . \nThe Devil 's Ultimate Weapon , the Nuclear Bomb , and Killing Laser Technology ? \nWhy Kill GODs Planet , and All Life Our Ancestors Colonized on Earth ? \nThe Unknown GOD\\/LIFE has given the Human Species Free Will , to follow LIFE or Death . \nThe High Tech Science Equal Humans , our Human Ancestors , have chosen GODs Eternal Physical Life , After Equal High Tech Science Birth . \nEqual Male and Female Equal Human Clones , took over the Unequal Reproduction of Humans . \nEver since Humans began Killing Each Other . \nSo what are the Results of Sin ? \nA Dead Planet Earth after the Last Days Nuclear ` Arm ` ageddon , and the Planetary Judgement Day Fire from our Pollution ? \nThe Human Species do Colonize Planets . \nWe do Know this High Tech today . \nWhat exactly is Life After Death in Heaven ? \nOur Decomposed Elements returning to GODs Storehouse , Our Universe ? \nA Prophecy whose TiME is Cometh ! \n`` Give the people of the United States the facts which reach our government with regard to events in all areas in which the freedom of the American press is in any way restricted . '' \nIn our society the people decide for themselves what is best and the press supports the people . \nThe government does n't always like that , but it beats having a ruined press and ignorant people that are both powerless . \nInvest in the newspaper business and use some of the profit to help those less fortunate . \nWall Street can help itself . \nIt will do about as well as those it helps . \nThe economy just keeps rolling forward along with the presses . \nSome people would like to stop both and it just ca n't be done . \nYou ca n't stop the rain . \nTake an umbrella if it looks like rain . \nIt looks like rain here at the estate , so the garden should be happy . \nThat 's where my lunch is now growing out of the ground , so I better go pick lunch . \nSome things you ca n't pick , so you need to choose . \nChoices are good and options are many . \nBut somehow I doubt it . \nAnd I do n't mean ` sacrificing ' by letting the government spend tons of taxpayer money to bail everyone out . \nReal sacrifice is on an individual level . \nAnd there 's plenty of people who are very deserving of the charity of those who were either better-prepared for this , or just lucky enough not to get hurt by everything happening . \nI am not responsible . \nI 've spent a lifetime being ridiculed because I did NOT jump on the gravy train - did NOT live beyond my means - No , religion does not call it idolatry - religion calls it USURY - And unless you are free form it 's influence in your own life - you do n't really have the moral high ground to assume that everyone else is guilty . \nPeople will not ask themselves these questions - and as soon as the DOW bumps up a bit - people will promptly forget and revert to their ususal consumptive ways . \nUnless you are truly practicing your religion as proscribed , and have no usurious history yourself - your censures have a flatness about them .

{"txt": "According to the Guardian ; William Hague , the -LRB- UK -RRB- foreign secretary , approved the botched plan to send a team of armed diplomats and SAS -LRB- Special Air Service -RRB- soldiers into eastern Libya in an effort to build diplomatic contacts with anti-Gaddafi rebels . \nThe eight M16 officers and SAS soldiers were arrested then deported after only two days in the country . \nThey were later released , but were not allowed to leave the country . \nHow could that happen to a British delegation that was trying to help ? \nHague 's statement at the Commons created more questions than answers . \nHe said : On 5 March opposition groups in the East formed an Interim National Council based in Benghazi . \nMinisters and FCO -LRB- Foreign and Commonwealth Office -RRB- officials are in contact with members of this Council , who welcomed the idea of a British diplomatic mission to Libya ... Last week I authorised the despatch of a small British diplomatic team to Eastern Libya , in uncertain circumstances which we judged required their protection , to build on these initial contacts and to assess the scope for closer diplomatic dialogue . \nI pay tribute to that team . \nThey were withdrawn yesterday after a serious misunderstanding about their role leading to their temporary detention . \nThe British opposition smells blood . \nShadow Foreign Secretary , Douglas Alexander is accusing the government of `` serial bungling , '' saying that `` The British public are entitled to wonder whether , if some new neighbors moved into the Foreign Secretary 's street , he would introduce himself by ringing the doorbell or instead choose to climb over the fence in the middle of the night ? '' \nMenzies Campbell , a former opposition leader from the Liberal Democrats , called the mission `` ill-conceived , poorly planned and embarrassingly executed . '' \nBut that 's just rhetoric at the Commons . \nIt 's part of the usual thrust and parry of British politics , and it 's internal . \nThe real embarrassment for Britain was played out across TV screens in Tripoli . \nHere 's what happened : 10 Downing Street 's man in Libya was called in to explain what the `` diplomats '' were doing in eastern Libya . \nBritish Ambassador Richard Northern spoke to a rebel leader to explain the mission . \nAnd , you guessed it , the call was intercepted by Gadhafi 's regime and duly found its way to Libyan state television on Sunday . \nNow all of Libya will have a very different take on James Bond . \nThe whole fiasco makes it ever more important for countries to think very carefully before they engage with Libya . \nThere 's also the question of who you 're dealing with in Libya -- Gadhafi himself , or the varied opposition groups that are rising up in arms ? \nAnd how will they respond ? \nAs U.S. Defense Secretary Gates testified at a House hearing last week , discussing no-fly zones without fully understanding the repercussions is just '' loose talk .

{"txt": "Family devastated by death of Scottish swine flu victim The prematurely born son of Jacqui Fleming , the mother who died yesterday from swine flu , has also died tonight The Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley , Scotland . \nPhotograph : David Moir\\/Reuters The family of the first British swine flu patient to die said today they were `` absolutely devastated '' as health experts tried to allay public fears about the virulence of the virus . \nJacqui Fleming , 38 , from Carnwadric in south Glasgow , was named today as the first person outside the Americas to have died since the H1N1 virus first emerged in Mexico more than three months ago . \nFleming was one of 10 people in hospital with swine flu in Scotland , where hospitalisation rates are the same as in the United States . \n`` Jacqueline had suffered from a number of complications during her fight against the virus , '' Nicola Sturgeon said in a statement . \nThe birth was induced nearly three months early because of her critical condition . \nNHS Greater Glasgow said tonight that her son , named Jack , also died today . \nAn NHS spokesman said the baby did not die from swine flu . \nA statement issued on behalf of Ms Fleming 's partner William McCann , said : `` My beautiful son was born on 1st June 2009 , 11 weeks early . \n`` He suffered from a number of complications and despite his brave fight he passed away earlier this evening at the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley . \n`` Coming so soon after the death of his mum , this is an extremely distressing and difficult time for our family and I would ask the media to respect our privacy as we try to cope with the loss of Jacqueline and Jack . '' \nA statement from NHS Greater Glasgow said : `` Earlier this evening , baby Jack , the son of Jacqueline Fleming and her partner William McCann , tragically passed away . '' \nShe leaves two other children , one boy aged 18 and another at primary school . \nHer family said : `` Our whole family is absolutely devastated and we are doing everything we can to support Jacqueline 's two sons and her partner . \n`` Jacqueline has been ill in hospital for a number of weeks but nothing can prepare you for such shattering news .

{"txt": "By Hilary Andersson BBC Panorama , Washington Tyrone Benton : ` We saw a leak ' A Deepwater Horizon rig worker has told the BBC that he identified a leak in the oil rig 's safety equipment weeks before the explosion . \nTyrone Benton said the leak was not fixed at the time , but that instead the faulty device was shut down and a second one relied on . \nBP said rig owners Transocean were responsible for the operation and maintenance of that piece of equipment . \nTransocean said it tested the device successfully before the accident . \nBP said it was responsible for the operation and maintenance of that piece of equipment . \nOn 20 April , when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded killing 11 people , the blowout preventer , as the device is known , failed . \nInvestigations into the US oil spill are focused on the blowout preventer system of valves on the seabed . \nThe system 's control panel is its electronic `` brains '' , keeping valves open to allow flow from well to rig . \nIn an emergency , hydraulic valves or shear rams should close shut on the pipe , sealing it and preventing flow . \nBACK -LCB- current -RCB- of -LCB- total -RCB- NEXT The most critical piece of safety equipment on the rig , they are designed to avert disasters just like the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe blowout preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- has giant shears which are designed to cut and seal off the well 's main pipe . \nThe control pods are effectively the brains of the blowout preventer and contain both electronics and hydraulics . \nThis is where Mr Benton said the problem was found . \n`` We saw a leak on the pod , so by seeing the leak we informed the company men , '' Mr Benton said of the earlier problem he had identified . \n`` They have a control room where they could turn off that pod and turn on the other one , so that they do n't have to stop production . '' \nProfessor Tad Patzek , petroleum expert at the University of Texas , was blunt in his assessment : `` That is unacceptable . \nIf you see any evidence of the blowout preventer not functioning properly , you should fix it by whatever means possible . '' \nMr Benton said his supervisor e-mailed both BP and Transocean about the leaks when they were discovered . \nHe said he did not know whether the leaking pod was turned back on before the disaster or not . \nBP - In Deep Water , BBC One , Monday , 21 June at 2030BST Then available in the UK via the link below Henry Waxman , a House of Representatives Democrat who is overseeing congressional investigations into the rig disaster , has accused BP of taking safety shortcuts to save money . \n`` BP appears to have made multiple decisions for economic reasons that increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure , '' Mr Waxman said . \nBP chief executive Tony Hayward , giving evidence to Congress , said : `` There is nothing I have seen in the evidence so far that suggests that anyone put cost ahead of safety , if there are then we will take action . '' \nCongress has identified numerous other problems with the blowout preventer , including design problems , unexpected modifications and a flat battery . \nThe other major problems on the rig , Congress has said , centred around the cement job . \nCement in an oil well blocks explosive gases from escaping , and it appears the cement may not have set properly on the Deepwater Horizon . \nEnd Quote Robert Peston BBC business editor BP said it had indications of a successful cementing operation and the company that was in charge of the cement job , Halliburton , has said it was consistent with that used in similar applications . \nSeveral rig workers the BBC spoke to who were on the Deepwater Horizon said there was pressure in April to work fast . \nWork to prepare and then seal the well was behind schedule and had to be completed before a production rig could move in and start turning profits . \n`` Too many jobs were being done at one time . \nIt should have just really slowed down and just took one job at a time , to make sure everything was done the way it should have been , '' said Mr Benton , who is now suing BP and Transocean for negligence . \nBP has responded to Mr Benton 's account saying Transocean was responsible for both the maintenance and operation of the blowout preventer . \nTMC Net Daily Mail : Oil worker ` alerted BP about rig fault ' -LRB- Daily Mail -LRB- London , England -RRB- -RRB- - 3 hrs ago Sky News Protesters Interrupt BP Speech - 4 hrs ago Mirror . \nco. uk I WARNED OF BP SAFETY FAULT WEEKS BEFORE RIG EXPLODED - 10 hrs ago x BP hit with 64,000 claims over Gulf coast oil spill - 14 hrs ago News24 . \ncom Rig worker makes safety charge - 28 hrs ago The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

Kent Conrad -LRB- D-N.D. -RRB- chairs the Senate banking committee . \nConrad is the chairman of the Budget Committee . \n \n \nAnd we 're in a Category 4 . '' \nOthers wondered whether Geithner , who has a youthful manner , could inspire youthful confidence in the markets . \n-LRB- This story was corrected at the bottom of the story . \n-LRB- Daniel Acker - Bloomberg News -RRB- President-elect Barack Obama has selected New York Federal Reserve Bank President Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary , handing the post to a primary architect of the Bush administration 's response to the financial crisis , according to Democratic and industry officials yesterday . \nAt 47 , he is the same age as Obama and would represent a generational change in the highest levels of Washington economic policymaking , heading a remarkably young team of White House economic advisers tasked with sorting out one of the worst financial messes since the Great Depression . \nA Democrat and a relative unknown outside the world of high finance , Geithner has worked closely with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to devise responses to the most critical events of the market turmoil , including the bailouts of the investment bank Bear Stearns and the insurance giant American International Group . \nLike Paulson , Geithner believes that the Treasury should be given vast powers to develop experimental strategies for responding to the crisis and the flexibility to abandon them if they do n't work . \nGeithner 's mentor is Lawrence H. Summers , 53 , a Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration who also was in the running for the job . \nSummers instead will go to the White House and serve as a senior economic adviser to Obama , according to a senior Democratic official familiar with the matter . \nMeanwhile , Obama is seriously considering a former opponent in the primary campaign , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , to head the Commerce Department , according to the official . \nJoining Summers in the White House would be Jason Furman , 38 , as a top economic adviser ; Peter R. Orszag , 39 , as White House budget director ; and Austan Goolsbee , 39 , on the president 's Council of Economic Advisers , sources familiar with the matter said . \nThe rollout of the economic team is expected to take place in Chicago on Monday , according to a transition source who spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcements have not been made yet . \nAs for the timing , this source said , `` Everything has been accelerated on the economic front because of the news of the last few months '' but not in reaction to any specific market trends this week . \nThe problems facing the new administration are dire as the government 's effort to rescue the banking system falters . \nYesterday , Goldman Sachs said it expected the economy to shrink even faster during the fourth quarter of this year , at a 5 percent annualized rate . \nThe investment bank predicted that unemployment would soar to 9 percent by the end of next year . \nThe stock markets cheered the would-be appointment of Geithner , who is well-known to Wall Street . \nThe Dow Jones industrial average had been down as much as 1.4 percent in the morning . \nAround 3 p.m. , when news of Obama 's pick broke , the index shot up , ending the day 494.13 , or 6.5 percent , higher . \n`` Geithner is uniquely situated and has the business experience and the political experience and the policy experience to handle this crisis , '' said Scott Talbott , senior vice president of the Financial Services Roundtable , which lobbies for the nation 's largest financial firms . \n`` Everyone I talked to at the New York banks have had positive comments or no negative comments . '' \nHe also has experience in addressing complex crises . \nIn the late 1990s , he worked under Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Summers to guide the Clinton administration 's response to currency collapses in Russia , Mexico and Asia . \nIn the last years of the administration , Summers became Treasury secretary and Geithner was promoted to undersecretary . \nGeithner `` will get a very favorable response in the Senate , '' said Sen. Kent Conrad -LRB- D-N.D. -RRB- , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee . \n`` You saw the relief rally in the market today ...

{"txt": "The White House is `` analyzing '' the speech of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi to see `` what possibilities it contains for meaningful reform , '' a senior U.S. administration official said Sunday night after the Libyan leader 's son took to the airwaves to propose speedy implementation of significant democratic reforms following days of anti-government demonstrations . \nThe same source confirmed that President Barack Obama was monitoring the situation in Libya and `` considering all appropriate actions .

'' \nThe terminology echoed an earlier statement from State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley . \nIn a speech on Libyan state television that he said was unscripted , Gadhafi warned of a civil war and mass poverty if citizens sided with anti-government demonstrators . \n`` Tomorrow , we can speak rationally , we can spare the blood , we can stand all together for the sake of Libya , '' he said . \nBut if the unrest continues , `` forget about democracy , forget about reform ... It will be a fierce civil war . '' \nEvents in Libya are very difficult to confirm , since the government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated CNN requests for access to the country . \nInside Libya , a local leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in the coastal city , Misurata , was unimpressed by Gadhafi 's speech . \n`` He is worse than his father , '' the leader said . \n`` His claims about the establishment of Islamic emirates in the country is not true at all . \n`` Despite our differences , Libyans are all one , '' he continued . \n`` They are all out on the streets against the regime . \nHe called the protesters unstable ! \nIt is the regime members who are not stable for spending the country 's wealth on petty things ! '' \nThe country 's second-largest city , Benghazi , has seen some of the bloodiest clashes since protests began . \nA staff member working at the Benghazi Medical Center said of Gadhafi : `` He is a liar . \nContrary to what Saif said , there are no divisions among Libyans . \nWe are proud to be free from this regime . \nWe have liberated the east of the country and we want to be united with our brothers and sisters in the east . \n... All Libyans think this way , it is the regime that lacks knowledge about the people . '' \nMeanwhile , a journalist working in the capital Tripoli said the speech caused further confusion . \n`` But most do not believe his talk of civil war , '' the journalist said . \n`` Earlier , thousands went to the streets chanting anti-government slogans calling on Gadhafi to leave the country . \nBut now after the speech some pro-government crowds gathered in the downtown area . '' \nHuman Rights Watch researcher Fred Abrahams said that he did n't believe the speech would placate crowds of people who are looking for change . \n`` There 's been so much resentment built up over four decades of rule , '' he said . \n`` Serious violations , disappearances , political killings , total restrictions on freedom of assembly , no free media , and corruption ...

{"txt": "Syria 's Foreign Minister Walid Muallem : `` We have withdrawn some military units '' Fresh clashes have broken out in Syria despite the passing of a UN-backed deadline for a complete withdrawal of government troops and weapons . \nActivists reported shelling in Homs and areas of northern Aleppo province , and unrest in the capital , Damascus . \nRights groups said 11 people had been killed on Tuesday . \nSyria 's Foreign Minister Walid Muallem , in Russia for talks , said Damascus had taken steps to adhere to the plan by withdrawing some troops . \nHe blamed `` armed gangs '' for the continuing violence . \nUnder the peace plan - negotiated by the UN and Arab League 's special envoy on the Syrian crisis , Kofi Annan - Syrian troops were to have completed their withdrawal from population centres and stopped the use of heavy weaponry by Tuesday , ahead of a full ceasefire coming into place on Thursday . \nDamascus had agreed to the deadline , but on Sunday demanded written guarantees first that its opponents would give up arms , along with a promise from foreign states not to fund them . \nJim Muir BBC News , Beirut Mr Muallem 's suggestion that a ceasefire should coincide with the arrival of international peace monitors is getting things completely out of the sequence envisaged by Kofi Annan . \nThat called for the government to take the first step in pulling back its forces , and the opposition would follow suit in applying a ceasefire by Thursday morning . \nThe observers would then come in to monitor an existing peace , not be part of the stabilisation process in terms of going into a combat situation and trying to calm it themselves . \nIt indicates to me there is no clear way forward coming out of the meetings , unless there are things that have been decided behind the scenes . \nEverybody recognizes the Annan peace plan went as far as anybody could go in providing a balanced , peaceful political solution . \nIf this does n't work its very hard to see how any other plan could . \nSpeaking after talks with his Russian counterpart , Mr Muallem said army units had been withdrawn from some areas , a number of detainees released and agreement reached on getting humanitarian aid to those in need . \nBut he said that `` despite all these positive measures we noticed on a daily basis the escalation of opposition by the armed terrorist gangs '' . \nMr Muallem told the BBC Syria would only stop killing civilians `` when these groups stop killing '' . \nHe said a ceasefire could only come into force once a team of international observers had arrived , but also accused Turkey of supplying militant groups with weapons and allowing them to cross its borders , AFP reports . \nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Syrian government `` could have been more active and decisive '' in implementing the plan , but that Mr Muallem had assured him Damascus was committed to it . \nSuccess rested on those countries with influence over the opposition groups putting pressure on them to abide by a ceasefire as well , he said . \n10 April : Government must withdraw troops and heavy weapons such as tanks from towns , cities and villages Following 48 hours : Ceasefire to be implemented on the ground with the onus on the opposition to follow the government 's lead 06:00 local time on 12 April : All forms of violence must be stopped on all sides Next step : All parties to hold talks on a political solution Russia is one of Syria 's closest allies and as a permanent member of the UN Security Council has vetoed resolutions condemning Damascus . \nFrance 's foreign ministry described Mr Muallem 's comments as `` a fresh expression of this blatant and unacceptable lie '' that Damascus was committed to the Annan plan and urged the international community to react against the `` feeling of impunity '' . \nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said six civilians were killed by fresh shelling in Homs on Tuesday and another was shot dead in the city . \nIt said another four people were killed in Kfar Zeita in central Hama province , while military activity was also reported in Aleppo province . \nIt may be too early to draw a definitive line under Kofi Annan 's peace plan for Syria , but it is not looking in terribly good health '' Mr Annan was visiting some of the

{"txt": "The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist . \nThe opinions expressed are his own . \nA young Syrian called Ausama Monajed was on a train to London . \nOne of his hobbies was reading e-books . \nOn this trip , he picked Gene Sharp s From Dictatorship to Democracy , which maps out strategies for using non-violent struggle to bring down repressive regimes . \nMonajed , now one of the revolution s leaders outside the country , became engrossed . \nIt was as if I was reading an exact description of Syria , Monajed told Reuters Breakingviews . \nThe next thing he noticed was a conductor tapping him on the shoulder . \nThe train had arrived at its terminus in Euston Station . \nHe asked me if I wanted to return where I d come from . \nSharp , who was inspired by India s Mohandas Gandhi and who himself influenced some of the activists behind the Egyptian revolution , stresses that a dictator s power isn t monolithic . \nIt relies on the army , police , civil service , business and , indeed , the wider society just to function . \nActivists should therefore analyze those pillars of support and systematically undermine them . \nThe best way to do this is not to fight dictators with their own weapons - matching violence with violence in a struggle they are likely to lose but to use non-violent tactics . \nIt is much harder for the security forces to kill unarmed civilians than those who fire back at you . \nThe more brutally the regime represses them , the shakier its pillars of support become . \nEventually , the violence boomerangs on the regime and destroys it . \nSharp makes clear that non-violent struggles normally don t succeed through spontaneous combustion . \nThey need planning and training . \nMost importantly , it is vital to maintain nonviolent discipline which isn t easy when activists are being killed , tortured and detained . \nMonajed , now 31 , was smitten . \nAn economist by training , he had hoped that Syria s president Bashar al-Assad would be a reformer when he succeeded his father Hafez Assad , who died in 2000 . \nMonajed worked for the United National Development Programme and then the European Commission on development programs inside Syria . \nBut then he became disillusioned and joined the opposition . \nAfter being arrested several times , Monajed quit the country in 2005 and has never returned . \nHe says he has become one of the regime s most wanted people after writing an article in the Washington Post this April . \nThis said the U.S. government had several years ago funded Barada TV , a London-based channel beaming anti-regime programming into Syria which he had helped establish . \nAfter coming across Sharp s work , Monajed studied previous nonviolent revolutions , especially the Serbs overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 . \nHe went to see Sharp , now an 83-year-old academic , in Boston . \nHe also wrote a master s degree dissertation on the role of the internet and information technology in non-violent struggle with a focus on Syria . \nIn 2007 Monajed organized a meeting with some disaffected Syrian friends in London . \nHe says it is too risky to reveal their names . \nThey decided to get trained in the techniques of nonviolent struggle and use that as the basis for training others . \nWe brought Syrians out of the country and trained them in nonviolent techniques , Monajed says . \nThe idea was to train leaders and send them back to train others . \nThey found it hard to recruit volunteers . \nThey were told nonviolent struggle wouldn t work in Syria because of religious and geopolitical factors . \nIn the end , they managed to train around 100 people . \nThen came the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions . \nThe whole Middle East was electrified . \nSyrians began to think they too might get their freedom . \nPeople contacted Monajed s group , saying that now they understood what it was advocating . \nThe first protest took place on March 15 in the Hamidiyeh bazaar in the heart of old Damascus . \nThey chose Hamidiyeh because it is a covered market . \nThere were only about 40 protesters but their chants , calling for freedom , echoed off the iron roof making it seem like there were more . \nBecause the bazaar was crowded , it was hard to distinguish who was a protestor and who was just an onlooker - again exaggerating their numbers . \nThe next protests took place spontaneously in Deraa , near the border with Jordan , after 15 school children had been arrested for scrawling anti-regime graffiti on walls . \nThese protests were much bigger , with thousands eventually taking part . \nThe security services fired on unarmed civilians . \nThe killing began in earnest . \nAfter that , protests started mushrooming around the country . \nFacebook pages were created ; people communicated via Twitter ; protesters took video clips with their mobile phones and posted them on YouTube . \nEverything was happening faster than Monajed and his colleagues had imagined . \nMost of the protests had nothing to do with them . \nThe challenge was how to put some order into the revolution . \nAn early priority was to set up a virtual operation center , staffed by dozens of volunteers outside the country , feeding what was happening on the ground to the world outside . \nMost foreign journalists were quickly kicked out of the country , including one Reuters journalist who was beaten up by the secret police , so it was important to get information out to the international media . \nMany of the most popular internet pages were coordinated through a new body , The Coalition of Syrian Pages . \nOn the ground , local coordinating committees started emerging in different neighborhoods . \nThey organize campaigns , raise money to cover living costs of the families of those who had been killed or detained , and help communicate what is happening in their area . \nThe Coalition of Syrian Pages has gradually taken a bigger role in coordinating activity . \nIt consists of about 20-25 people , some inside the country and some abroad . \nMonajed won t reveal their names . \nThe authorities don t know who all the members of the Coalition are or where they are , he explains . \nOne of the current priorities is to have a strategic plan that includes action on the ground and international lobbying for things like an oil embargo . \nThis has involved coordinating the work of the activists , most of whom are young , with the traditional cohort of opposition made up of politicians , lawyers and human rights campaigners , many of whom signed the anti-regime Damascus Declaration in 2005 . \nInitially there wasn t a plan ; just an idea of demonstrating until the regime falls , says Monajed . \nNow , with the Coalition , we are trying to guide the effort in a strategic manner to knock down the -LRB- regime s -RRB- pillars of support . \nA particularly sensitive issue , which didn t exist in either Egypt or Tunisia , is the potential for sectarian conflict . \nAssad is an Alawite , a minority Shi ite Muslim sect . \nMany of the top positions in government , the military and business are also held by Alawites . \nBut most of the population is Sunni Muslim . \nGiven this background , the regime s four main pillars of support in order of importance , according to Monajed , are : the security forces including secret police ; the Alawites ; army generals , especially those who are Alawite ; and the Sunni business elite , many of whom have prospered since Assad partly liberalised the economy . \nIn order to knock down these pillars , it is essential to keep the campaign peaceful , says Monajed . \nPeople don t want a Libyanisation of the situation , he says , referring to the civil war across the Mediterranean Sea . \nSo demonstrators give roses to the army and don t insult them in their chants . \nThe underlying message they are trying to send to the top generals is : We differentiate between you and the security service . \nSome soldiers have mutinied after being ordered to kill unarmed protesters . \nThe message to the Alawites is that they are being held hostage by the Assad regime - and it can t be in their interests to engage in a war of elimination . \nThe protesters have used chants stressing the unity between Sunni , Alawites and Christians -LRB- another minority -RRB- and called on Alawite and Christian generals to lead the transition to democracy . \nDespite this , there are signs of sectarian violence . \nThere has already been at least one case of a group of Alawites being killed -- in retaliation for a Sunni elder being killed and cut into pieces , according to Monajed . \nThat , in turn , provoked a ferocious backlash against Sunnis in the city of Homs . \nMeanwhile , the message to the business community is that they won t continue to prosper under Assad . \nThe Syrian pound has fallen on the black market , tourism is dead , consumer demand has been thwacked and the economy is shrinking . \nWhat about the secret police ? \nThis is the toughest part of the regime to crack , according to Monajed . \nHe doesn t have a simple message for them . \nRather , he predicts that , as the revolution goes on , the regime will get tired and exhausted . \nThe top generals may then liaise with Alawite leaders , arrest Assad and the top security chiefs , and form a transitional council with members from all parts of the community . \nWhile strategizing is important , nothing will happen without action on the ground . \nAlthough protests have been the most visible tactic , they are not the only method being deployed . \nThere are low-risk tactics for those who don t want to go on protests where they could get killed . \nOne is to release freedom balloons at a specific time in a particular city , to give people courage that they are not alone . \nAnother is to open their windows at night time and play revolutionary rap songs . \nActivists have drawn up lists of shame of businesses , actors , intellectuals , imams and priests who are considered too close to the regime . \nThese are used to determine boycotts and strikes . \nCampaigners have also produced lists of government informers , according to the Financial Times . \nTheir aim is to put pressure on them and isolate them . \nHowever , there are also reports of at least two informers being killed . \nThe Assad regime has been far from idle . \nAs of last week , 1,634 civilians had been killed , according to Avaaz , the human rights group . \nThen on Sunday tanks were sent into the central Syrian city of Hama , in what looks like an attempt to break the protesters ' morale before the holy month of Ramadan , which has now started . \nDemonstrations have been particularly big on Fridays after people have gathered to pray in mosques . \nSome protesters have been saying that Ramadan could be like a month of Fridays . \nAs the regime 's violence ramps up , it would be natural for the protesters either to lose courage or to take up arms themselves . \nThe challenge for Monajed 's group will be to ensure that neither happens . \nIf they succeed , they will then have a chance to witness whether a nonviolent struggle can really bring a brutal regime tumbling down . \nRevolutions -- for better or worse -- are flash points in the process of human evolution which can be traced back to advances in technology . \nHistory shows that to be a universal truth . \nFor the so called `` Western World , '' the advent of written Language and Law is the story of Moses . \nThe printing press made it possible for many more humans to have their own copy of the Bible . \nOnce the word got out the next period of unrest gave us the Protestant reformation . \nFast forward to Vietnam . \nAs soon as video of the mayhem became television fodder , government propaganda insisting that people on the other side of the world are somehow less human became repugnant . \nThe Soviet Union disintegrated because their citizens desire for Blue Jeans and MTV made it impossible to maintain the illusion that the West lived in abject poverty . \nLikewise the Internet and World Wide travel have forced the sun shine of truth into every hell hole on the planet . \nOne person with a cell phone can reach out and touch the hearts of more people then the President of the United States . \nAmerica , China , Russia and even Saudi Arabia have had to appease citizens opinion by saying Syria 's is a dictatorship that has to go even though they know full well that such sentiments may be applied at home as well . \nWhat we are witnessing is a none economic kind of creative destruction that will bring down all the pillars of false power -- government corruption , fiat monitory schemes and religious dogma . \nThe American revolution lead to years of instability and adjustments as the theory of individual sovereignty met the reality of

{"txt": "LONDON | Thu Oct 6 , 2011 10:36 am BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Defensive stocks in sectors such as telecoms and utilities offer `` outstanding value '' and are set to benefit as investors switch out of over-priced government bonds , said Armstrong Investment Managers ' Patrick Armstrong . \nArmstrong , whose London-based firm manages 251 million pounds in assets , said the telecoms , healthcare and utilities sectors had been hit by `` indiscriminate selling '' by index investors , and said he had added to telecoms holdings on Tuesday . \n`` Investors are destroying the real value of their wealth with bonds which yield significantly less than inflation , '' Armstrong , who is joint managing partner and head of investment selection at the firm , said in an interview late on Tuesday . \n`` We expect a rotation out of these bonds into high-yielding equities , which have stable earnings and cash flows , '' he said . \nAccording to Armstrong , Western economies are heading for stagflation -- an unhealthy mix of economic stagnation and inflation -- as governments and central banks continue to try to revive their flagging economies . \nThis is set to make government bonds -- in which investors have taken refuge from this summer 's financial market woes -- less attractive , he said . \nGerman 10-year bond yields have dropped below 1.8 percent from above 3 percent at end-June , while 10-year Treasury yields have fallen to less than 1.9 percent from 3.2 percent . \nEuro zone inflation , in contrast , rose unexpectedly to 3 percent in September , its highest level in almost three years . \nThe STOXX Europe 600 Utilities . \nSX6R index is down 13 percent since end-June and is on a price\\/earnings ratio of 9.9 times , for instance . \n`` France Telecom -LRB- FTE . \nPA -RRB- is on less than three times cashflow . \nEven if there 's no growth again ... you get the cash in less than three years . \nAnd there 's a dividend yield of 12 percent , '' said Armstrong . \nArmstrong has bought shares in luxury goods companies CF Richemont -LRB- CFR . \nVX -RRB- and Tiffany -LRB- TIF . \nN -RRB- in recent days , as well as in drinks giant Coca-Cola -LRB- KO . \nN -RRB- , believing emerging market demand can drive earnings growth even as Western economies slow . \nSuch companies now account for 4.8 percent of his fund . \n`` At 13 times earnings there 's still potential for earnings growth if we do n't have a global recession , and just have a Western recession , '' he said . \n`` In China the lower-middle class view it -LRB- Coca Cola -RRB- as a luxury good .

{"txt": "Based on measurements taken in June , scientists have recreated the shape and distribution of oil in a massive plume in the Gulf of Mexico -- evidence the spill may not vanish as quickly as hoped . \nBlue indicates low methane concentrations , red high . \nScience\\/AAAS Is the Gulf getting cleaner ? \nOr does oil there pose a long-term hazard ? \nIt seems to depend mostly on whom you ask . \nScientists have discovered an oil plume at least 22 miles long , 3,000 feet deep in the Gulf of Mexico -- suggesting that the tens of millions of gallons of oil that leaked from a broken BP well could persist far longer than expected . \nWhether the plume 's existence poses a significant threat to the Gulf ecosystem and sea life is not yet clear , the researchers say . \n`` We do n't know how toxic it is , '' said Christopher Reddy , a Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute -LRB- WHOI -RRB- marine geochemist and oil spill expert and one of the authors of the study . \n`` But knowing the size , shape , depth , and heading of this plume will be vital for answering many of these questions . '' \nThe existence of the plume , which was concretely pinned to the blown-out well , seems to contradict a five-page report released August 4 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- , which claimed `` a vast majority '' of the BP oil spill is now completely gone . \nThe remaining 25 % consists of residual oil buried in sediments and sand , the report claimed . \nResearchers and scientists as well as environmental groups and Gulf residents immediately disagreed with the report , calling it `` misleading if not totally inaccurate . '' \nYet despite the seeming contrast between the government report and their new findings , Reddy refused to describe this new evidence as a contradiction . \n`` What the government has done and other universities are trying to do is constrain a budget , '' he said , arguing that it was too early to determine whether this finding was a smoking gun or just `` a penny in a very big checking account . '' \n`` I ca n't tell you how much oil is in the plume , '' he noted , so it does n't contradict the government 's report that only 26 % of the leak remains . \nAnd the picture will change as more chemical analysis is done , Reddy pointed out . \nBut one thing is clear : There 's definitely still oil down there . \n`` We 've shown conclusively not only that a plume exists , but also defined its origin and near-field structure , '' said Richard Camilli the other lead researcher from WHOI , of the 1.2 mile wide , 650 foot high plume . \nThe team 's observations were made during a June 19-28 scientific cruise aboard the National Science Foundation owned ship Endeavor . \nIt was halted by the onset of hurricane Alex. Since measurements ended nearly two months ago , the scientists admit they are unsure what has happened to the plume . \n`` We do n't know where these hydrocarbons are . \nWe saw them in June , '' Reddy said . \nThe findings were based on two technologies : an autonomous underwater vehicle called Sentry and an underwater mass spectrometer . \nBy integrating the two , researchers were able to detect even minute quantities of petroleum as well as other chemical compounds , something previous investigators were unable to achieve using conventional profiling . \nThey discovered consistent concentrations of hydrocarbons throughout the plume . \nGiven the makeup and concentration -- in excess of 50 micrograms per liter -- the researchers concluded that the plume could not have developed from natural seepage . \nFurther analysis of the samples will provide a clearer picture of the plume structure as well as a better estimate of the total amount of spilled oil . \nIt will also give insight into what sort of threat the plume poses . \n`` The plume is not pure oil , '' Camilli said . \n`` But there are oil compounds in there . '' \nIt may require a few months of laboratory analysis and validation , Reddy said . \nBoth researchers were surprised by the size and concentration of the plume . \n`` -LRB- The plume -RRB- is persisting for longer periods than we would have expected , '' Camilli said . \n`` Many people speculated that subsurface oil droplets were being easily biodegraded . '' \nThe underwater oil was also remarkably stable , hanging at around 3,000 feet beneath the surface . \n`` We do n't have any indications as to why it 's set up at that water depth , '' he said , an area meriting additional research . \nAnother unexpected result was the lack of `` dead zones , '' regions of significant oxygen depletion as a result of microbe metabolism . \n`` The oxygen data from the plume layer are telling us it is n't being rapidly consumed by microbes near the well , '' said Benjamin Van Mooy , a geochemist on the research team . \n`` The hydrocarbons could persist for some time . \nSo it is possible that oil could be transported considerable distances from the well before being degraded .

{"txt": "Wednesday 13 April 2005 01.03 BST The number of soldiers to desert the army or go absent without leave has more than doubled over the past year , the Ministry of Defense has revealed . \nThere are now more than 500 soldiers whose whereabouts are unknown . \nThe rise coincided with the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath . \nIndependent sources said yesterday that the war was clearly a factor . \nHowever , the rising trend over four years suggests that other issues also played a part . \nThe number of soldiers still illegally absent last year totalled 530 , compared with 205 in 2003 , 150 in 2002 , and 100 in 2001 . \nThe figures show that soldiers went Awol more than 3,000 times last year , with only a third of that figure accounting for returns to base within 21 days . \nThe largest number of soldiers going Awol came from the infantry , followed by the Royal Logistic Corps and the Royal Artillery , according to the MoD . \nThe figures were released to Bob Russell , the Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester , a garrison town . \nThough he first asked for the information in January , the MoD did not respond until it was too late for him to pursue the matter . \nThe response to his original question came more than two months later in a letter from the armed forces minister , Adam Ingram . \n`` The mere fact they took so long to answer the question is significant , '' Mr Russell said yesterday . \nHe asked for the information after being told by a source that a growing number of soldiers disapproved of the government 's stand on Iraq . \nHe still has not seen Mr Ingram 's letter , which was addressed to the Commons on the last full working day of parliament and gives no explanation for the rise . \nThe MoD said yesterday that it was unable to comment . \nGilbert Blades , a lawyer representing Awol soldiers , said Iraq was `` probably the biggest factor '' . \nBut he said a growing number of young soldiers were also not prepared to `` suffer the indignities and discipline '' of army life . \nJustin Houston-Roberts , who also represents soldiers , said : `` There 's been a very noticeable increase of not only soldiers but airmen as well asking our advice on being absent without leave , '' he said . \n`` Some are subjected to horrific bullying and run away to save themselves ...

{"txt": "Monday 28 February 2005 00.53 GMT Who would have thought that 13 pages of paper would so come to haunt Tony Blair ? \nYet the full version of the opinion drawn up by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , about the legality of a military attack on Iraq will , I suspect , come to rank in recent British history only with the protocol enshrining the Anglo-French-Israeli collusion before the invasion of Suez in 1956 . \nSir Anthony Eden instructed his cabinet secretary to burn the British copy of that protocol . \nTony Blair has long been irritated by what he sees as a malign British obsession with procedure rather than results . \nIn the past he has publicly dismissed such debate about the nuances and due processes of government as a kind of anorakry . \nHere he is in the House of Commons in July 2000 on the significance of the ministerial code , formerly known as questions of procedure for ministers : `` No one will be better governed through finetuning the ministerial code . \nThose are good issues for academics and constitutional experts , but they are not the big issues that parliament should debate when we consider our role in modern society . '' \nThe Butler report placed such matters as proper procedure right at the heart of Blair 's prime ministerial `` role in the modern society '' . \nOn July 20 2004 , six days after Butler was published , Blair was on his feet in the Commons undertaking to implement its procedural recommendations . \nThe constitutional anorak suddenly fitted the prime ministerial shoulders . \n`` Prior to the war , '' he said , `` meetings were held with an informal group , including the foreign and defense secretaries , the chief of the defense staff , the head of the Secret Intelligence Service , the chairman of the JIC , and my foreign policy adviser . \nIn any future situation , such a group , which brought together the key players required to work on operational military planning and developing the diplomatic strategy , will operate formally as an ad hoc cabinet committee . '' \nIn his report , Lord Butler showed that the government 's fundamental shift in the spring of 2002 from a policy of containing Saddam Hussein to one designed `` to enforce disarmament '' was not based on any new development in the current intelligence picture on Iraq . \nSimilarly , in the run-up to the war , Goldsmith -LRB- who eventually judged it legal without a further , specific UN resolution authorising the use of force -RRB- warned his ministerial colleagues that `` there would be no justification for the use of force against Iraq on grounds of self-defence against an imminent threat '' . \nOne of the impressive aspects of the Butler report was the way his committee followed the intelligence trail into the attorney general 's office and assessed the degree to which it did or did not shape his advice to the prime minister 's group on Iraq and to the cabinet . \nThe attorney general 's legal opinion has not been published in full . \nAll parliament has been given is a written answer from Goldsmith , with an accompanying summary prepared by the Foreign Office , dated March 17 2003 . \nThe Butler committee has seen the opinion in full . \nWhat we did not know until Butler appeared before the select committee on October 21 2004 was that initially the government had been unwilling to show it to Butler 's committee of privy counsellors . \nAs Butler put it : `` There were moments when we had a bit of tension with the government about whether they were going to disclose documents to us . \nOne of the examples of that was the attorney general 's legal opinion . \nHad we gone public and said , ` We think this is relevant to our committee and the government will not give use access to it , ' we would have had huge public and media support . \nThat was an important leverage on the government . '' \nButler 's revelation was striking in itself . \nBut it also suggested that Goldsmith 's opinion , which led to the resignation of Elizabeth Wilmshurst , the FO 's foremost expert on the legality of military operations , was even more finely balanced than we had thought . \nMissing from the Butler report is the information that it was not ministers who requested that final legal opinion from Goldsmith . \nIt was the senior military and top civil servants in the Ministry of Defense who did so . \nCan the full cabinet really have tested Goldsmith 's opinion when , as Butler reported , the attorney general set out his view on the legal position to the cabinet on March 17 2003 , by producing and speaking to the written answer he gave to parliament on that date ? \nFor me , this and the other accumulations of failures to scrutinise and question in the privacy of the cabinet room amounts to a dereliction of cabinet government comparable only to 1956 . \nThen Eden 's cabinet did not press him at the height of the Suez crisis on the significance of his telling them that `` from secret conversations which had been held in Paris with representatives of the Israeli government , it now appeared that the Israelis would not alone launch a full-scale attack against Egypt '' . \nFrom these remains you did not need a background in British intelligence to sniff out the collusion between the UK , France and Israel , which Eden subsequently flatly denied in the Commons . \nFor me , Goldsmith 's March 2003 opinion on the legality of the Iraq war remains the fault-line under the Blair government . \nLike the permanent stain of Suez on Eden 's reputation , it will not be eradicated from the memory of the Blair premierships for generations to come . \nThe ultimate systems failure in both instances occurred at proper , formal cabinet meetings . \nIf the full cabinet will not take on a dominant prime minister in full cry , there is no other part of the system of government that can compensate for such supineness . \nThe Commons , even if it is permitted a specific vote on peace and war -LRB- as it was in 2003 -RRB- , is not going to possess a range and detail of knowledge comparable to that of ministers . \nIn the Commons last July , Blair promised to tighten up his procedures if , heaven forbid , he should contemplate leading his country into another war of pre-emption . \nIt was a welcome recognition that Butler 's concerns were justified . \nBut can it make any difference if cabinet ministers will not , in a phrase beloved of Roy Jenkins , `` rise to the level of events '' ? \nWith a few big exceptions in the cabinet room , such as Gordon Brown and John Prescott , power and place come courtesy of Blair alone . \n`` Tony wants '' usually means that `` Tony gets '' . \nWill the Butler report really change those ingrained habits on the part of the dispenser and the receivers of patronage ? \nOnly , I suspect , if the engines of war are cranked up once more . \nPeter Hennessy is Attlee professor of contemporary British history , Queen Mary , London . \nThis is an edited version of an article in the current issue of the Political Quarterly www.blackwellpublishing.com Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Peter Hennessy : The blame for the Iraq war lies with our supine cabinet This article was published on guardian .

{"txt": "A somber Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak recognized demonstrators ' concerns while asserting his government 's duty to protect the African nation 's security in a nationally televised speech early Saturday , which he punctuated by announcing that he had asked his government to resign . \nMubarak began the address , which started just after midnight , with a call for unity , saying , `` We all honestly should stand with each other for this country . '' \nStill , it was n't until the speech 's conclusion that he detailed a major step he had taken to begin addressing the crisis : asking for his current government 's resignation . \nThe president -- who has been in power for 30 years -- then said he would form a new team , with a refocused mission acknowledging a popular desire for economic reforms , starting Saturday . \n`` I will ask the new government to have clear and specific responsibilities to deal , in a calculated way , with the the vital next phase , '' Mubarak said , according to a translation of his remarks from Arabic . \nMubarak said earlier that he had heard , and understood , demonstrators ' pleas asking for the government to take more action to create jobs , lower prices and improve the plight of the poor . \n`` I know all these things ... that the people are asking -LRB- because -RRB- I 've never been separated from it . \nI work for it every day , '' he said . \n`` I 'll always be on the side of the poor .

{"txt": "Get Wonkbook delivered to your inbox or mobile device every morning . \nIt 's like reading it on the blog , only much more convenient . \nWhat Does the U.S. Economy Need ? \nMichael Leachman of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities argues that the stimulus has created more jobs than recovery . \nBruce Katz , Emilia Istrate , and Jonathan Rothwell note that rising exports would do a lot for metropolitan areas . \nThe Sustainable Defense Task Force proposes cuts to the defense budget . \nBarry Eichengreen and Peter Temin compare the Gold Standard and the Euro . \nFlavio Cunha and James Heckman revew research suggesting that non-cognitive skills are important for young people 's life prospects . \nWhat Does Ben Bernanke Believe About the Financial Crisis ? \nBen Bernanke recommends that we read Yale University professor -- and former AIG consultant -- Gary Gorton 's papers for insight into the financial crisis . \nIt 's not a bad recommendation . \nGorton 's latest paper , '' Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand , '' is very good . \nBut it contains a lot of sentences like `` If securitization debt is informationally-insensitive , it can be an input into the repo system of creating a kind of transaction medium , i.e. , collateral that can be rehypothecated . '' \nSo let 's try to clean this up a bit . \nI should warn you that this post is , by blog standards , a bit long . \nBut I can also promise that it 's much , much shorter than Gorton 's paper . \nGorton 's basic argument is actually pretty elegant . \n`` The period from 1934 , when deposit insurance was enacted , until the current crisis is somewhat special in that there were no systemic banking crises in the U. S , '' he writes . \n`` It is the ` Quiet Period . ' '' \nThe Great Recession has been a high-decibel disruption of our happy quiescence . \nThe question is : What changed ? \nWhat did n't change , Gorton says , is the commercial banking sector . \nWe did not have a 1929-style bank run . \nDeposit insurance -- the system wherein the government insures deposits of individuals up to $ 250,000 -- worked . \nIndividuals did not line up around the block . \nRather , the entirety of the crisis was in the `` shadow banking sector . '' \nThis is where major institutions lend to one another . \nIt is a new , and largely unregulated , market . \nBut , in certain important ways , it is very similar to the old banking sector . \nAnd not the banking sector we 've had since 1934 . \nThe banking sector we had before 1934 . \nFixing the shadow banking sector will , for that reason , require the application of principles that fixed the commercial banking sector in the 1930s . \nIn other words : We 've done this before . \nThe important parallel between the two markets is that both individual depositors plugging $ 1,000 into their bank and institutional investors looking to park $ 12 million want the same thing . \nThey want , according to Gorton , `` informationally-insensitive debt . '' \nThis is a key concept , so let 's spend a moment on it . \nImagine you give Apple $ 1,000 for shares in its company . \nThe next day , a rumor starts . \nApple CEO Steve Jobs , it seems , has had his head amputated . \nHe might not be back at work for three to five months . \nYour iPhone cries a salty , electronic tear . \nSo does your portfolio . \nApple 's stock plummets . \nYour $ 1,000 is now worth $ 812 . \nThe stocks you bought from Apple were informationally-sensitive . \nThey were vulnerable to information . \nYou could not count on your $ 1,000 to exist come hell or high water . \nImagine , now , that you deposited that $ 1,000 in the bank instead . \nA week later , the bank becomes insolvent . \nHalf its employees immediately commit suicide . \nThe other half flee the country . \nThis is literally the worst information possible for your deposit . \nBut it does n't matter . \nThe government -- through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- insures your money . \nYour $ 1,000 is perfectly safe . \nIt was , as it turns out , information-insensitive . \nLarge investors , Gorton argues , also want informationally-insensitive debt . \nThey want to give a bank $ 10 million dollars , have the bank owe them $ 10 million in return and be assured that the $ 10 million is safe . \nBut the FDIC does n't ensure deposits that large . \nHence , the shadow banking market . \nI 'm going to glide by the details a bit , as they 're complex . \nHis paper has a fuller explanation . \nBut the shadow banking market , according to Gorton , works like this : A mega investor -- the `` depositor '' -- has $ 500 million he wants to deposit . \nAnother institution -- the `` bank , '' though it does n't have to be a bank as traditionally composed -- is willing to give the depositor collateral in return . \nThe collateral is , in most cases , a senior tranche of securitized loans -LRB- if you want a good explanation of that concept , see this paper -RRB- . \nThose tranches were generally considered informationally-insensitive . \nThey were the depositor 's insurance . \nBut there is a difference between being informationally-insensitive and being actually riskless . \nAn individual 's $ 500 deposit is safe unless the government itself defaults . \nThat 's pretty unlikely . \nThe senior tranche of a pack of subprime mortgages is safe as long as housing prices keep increasing . \nThat , as it turns out , was n't very unlikely at all . \nWhich brings us to another key point : `` a ` banking panic ' occurs when ` informationally-insensitive ' debt becomes ` informationally-sensitive ' due to a shock , in this case the shock to subprime mortgage values due to house prices falling . '' \nIn other words , a banking panic occurs when deposits stop looking safe . \nThat , Gorton argues , is how it happened in the days before deposit insurance , too . \nThen , for some reason , they did n't seem safe because the banks seemed like they might go bust . \nDepositors would panic and run to get their money back before the bank folded in on itself . \nThat would create a bank run , which would , in turn , create insolvent banks . \nWe ended bank runs in two ways : First , deposit insurance and associated regulations made bank deposits essentially riskless . \nSecond , we made bank charters valuable by promoting local monopolies , underpricing deposit insurance and other means . \nPut another way , the 75-year `` quiet period '' was a product of making deposits in commercial banks riskless for individuals and making commercial banks profitable for banks . \nGorton argues that a similar approach is needed for the shadow banking sector . \nToward the end of the paper , he offers a `` very broad '' sketch of what it would look like : 1 . \nSenior tranches of securitizations of approved asset classes should be insured by the government . \nThe government must supervise and examine banks , i.e. , securitizations , rather than rely on ratings agencies . \nThat is , the choices of asset class , portfolio and tranching must be overseen -LRB- by -RRB- examiners . \nEntry into securitization should be limited , and any firm that enters is deemed a ` bank ' and subject to supervision . \nIt is , in other words , very much like what we did after 1934 . \nExamining and insuring `` senior tranches of approve assets classes '' -- insuring collateral , in other words -- is rather a lot like what the FDIC does with deposits . \nLimiting access of firms into the shadow market -- which would probably be referred to as the `` institutional market '' or something similarly less-sinister sounding -- is rather like what we do with commercial bank charters . \nThis has been a bit of a long post , so I want to remind folks of the lede : I 'm not summarizing this paper because I think it 's interesting . \nI 'm summarizing it because Ben Bernanke is talking it up . \nYesterday , Felix Salmon wrote a post asking `` what use economic history ? '' \nI do n't know if it 's of any use , but the appeal of Gorton 's analysis to Bernanke might speak to its impact . \nGorton is essentially making an argument based on economic history . \nBernanke , of course , was an economic historian for most of his career . \nAnd according to Bernanke , this is a pretty good summation of how he 's understanding the banking crisis . \n-LRB- Photo credit : Brendan Smialowski -- Bloomberg News Photo -RRB- By Ezra Klein | May 29 , 2009 ; 6:45 AM ET Really great post Ezra . \nThe paper is interesting and your summary is a real service . \nI 'm so glad to see you expanding your expertise into the economy in such a disciplined way . \nKeep up the good work . \nIf they wanted a riskless asset they would have bought US bonds . \nNo they wanted a riskless asset that had the returns greater than a riskless asset . \nNo matter you opinion of full information in markets that large of an arbitrage opportunity just is n't there . \nConvincing yourself that there was no risk is the problem . \nIt happened to be real estate this time , but securitization could occur on anything . \nThat is the current problem , companies want their cake and eat it too . \nThat has happened already too many times . \nHave we not yet realized that true captilisim is a great sin ? \n-LRB- Not in religious terms but in moral and ethical terms -RRB- Posted by : 4thFloor | May 29 , 2009 9:28 AM | Report abuse I actually asked Gorton about this : He says that he thinks there simply are n't enough Treasury Bonds to fill this whole market . \nIf you look at his table on page 25 , you 'll see that mortgage-related debt and corporate debt have both been bigger than Treasury bonds in recent years . \nSo we 'd be talking about doubling or tripling the Treasury bonds in the field . \nI agree that investors turned to the shadow banking market because of higher returns , and , I would hazard to guess , they fell hook , line and sinker to the argument that risk , because of the quants , was a quaint `` old '' notion . \nHubris , in other words . \nSo , not different than the stock market , really . \nAnyone who did not know they were investing into a bubble was blind , and anyone who held on just 1 more day after the bad news started trickling out a long time before the `` crisis '' was greedy . \nI am not sure why investors in the shadow banking market be insulated from their bad decision making . \nDepositing your cash into a bank is something that most citizens MUST do in the current world in order to do anything else -LRB- cable , utilities , credit , mortgage , etc. -RRB- . \nInvesting in securitizations , hedge funds , etc. is something that the wealthy and institutional investors CHOOSE to do but not necessary in order to do anything else . \nMr. Gorton 's seductive analysis is nothing more than `` high school '' economics with the government becoming the insurer of last resort regardless of the actual risk . \nAs for Mr. Gorton and Mr. Klein , may I humbly suggest that they revisit their Econ 101 text paying close attention to the critical importance of risk adjusted interest rates as the only realistic method to insure the MOST EFFECTIVE ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL ! \nIf they only wanted the latter , then the individual investors who fund the institutional investors would have desposited in FDIC-insured banks or bought government bonds , as endaround suggests . \nMy reading of economic history suggests that part of the reason deposit insurance `` worked '' is that the shadow banking system was able to take up the slack , directing money toward riskier lending in a way that the FDIC-insured banking sector no longer could . \nI worry that if we try to make shadow banking `` safe , '' we risk unraveling both banking systems because it will be harder for riskier investments , which are critically important to the economy , to receive credit . \nA failing in that area of finance could ripple through the rest of the banking system -- unless a shadow shadow banking system emerges to take up the slack . \nFDIC insurance accomplishes two things that are broadly good for society : 1 -RRB- it encourages people to save money while providing capital for investment and 2 -RRB- it prevents bank runs . \nI 'm not so sure that securitization is something that 's worth providing tacit encouragement . \nBesides -- it 's hard to see how this would have changed things too much . \nThe asset bubble STILL would have burst , and you 'd have the government on the line for trillions in bad bets -LRB- just like they are now -RRB- . \nSure the banks and investors would be fine in the short term , but the burden would be just placed more directly on the taxpayer -LRB- though I suppose there 's something more honest about this -RRB- . \nMy guess is that he is interested in formally extending the reach of government licensing -LRB- and its counterpart : regulation -RRB- into securitzation , which he is well aware comprises about 50 % of the credit delivery system in the US today . \nHe has already taken the Fed there in a big way . \nIn my view there are reasons to want to shrink our reliance on securitization and bring it back within the boundaries of regulated banking . \nAs compared to old-fashioned banking , which required one-off credit judgments all along the life of a long from inception to repayment , securitization relies on statistical methods to automate lending and servicing . \nIn securitization , credit judgments are also skewed toward lending against payment streams -LRB- cash flow -RRB- rather than lending against asset values , whereas old-fashioned banking tended to rely more on asset coverage as a defense against loss . \nBernanke has not been asking questions about what kind of credit delivery system works best as much as he has been trying to keep the system that has evolved intact and functioning . \nThere seems to be no one in Washington thinking hard about this issue , but perhaps I am ill informed . \nMy personal policy recommendations would be to make the regulated deposit-taking banks the originators of all loans that are ultimately securitized , so as to have the benefit of old-fashioned underwriting , and to require that loans be seasons on the books of the banks for some initial period before they are sold into the secondary market , and then only rated AAA if the originating bank retains a 20 % equity stake . \nAs things stand , in mortgage lending for instance , the program definitions coming from the secondary market prescribe what kinds of loans are available and banks are doing no more than fitting applicants into boxes . \nThe information content is being massaged out of the loans . \nAlso , it seems to me that deposit insurance has removed information from the market place that would cause banks to be more prudent . \nWithout removing deposit insurance , there could be a rating system that would allow consumers to chose to put their money in safer banks rather than riskier ones , and for safer banks perhaps to pay less for deposits . \nI have a crazy idea : why do n't we call it the `` capital markets . '' \nYou know , like everyone in the world did for over a century before August 2007 , when the press adopted the sexier-sounding `` shadow banking sector '' name -LRB- at least partly to justify their inexplicable failure to cover the enormously-important capital markets -RRB- . \nBut I suspect that the reality left by the end of World War II had more to do with it . \nThat period seems to be at an end now . \nThere may be good reason to question whether financial manipulations on their own can produce a new quiet one . \nThe adjustments to the excesses of that boom period are one problem . \nThere is also the problem of adjusting to the end of the 500 year period of European world dominance . \nThen there is the problem of adjusting to one time events in human history like the depletion of energy , global warming , the impact of human generated waste on the planet , and exponential advancements of technology that probably will eventually allow major modifications in the natural curve of a person 's life . \nThe exact timing of the unfolding of these trends is of course very uncertain and it is not impossible that there will still be some extended periods of relative stability . \nBut it is also not impossible that these trends will all merge together in an extended period of much greater instability than those of us born after World War II are used to . \nThe line of reasoning is interesting . \nHowever , I have a lot of trouble gicing much credence to anything Gary Gorton Says given he spent years working for AIG FP consulting and building models for the credit business . \nHis online CV now omits this information , although given it was over a period of 9 or 10 years , I doubt it simply slipped his mind . \nPerhaps Gorton could give us some insight on what went wrong at FP ? \nYour readers need to know that Gortonis helped develop the formula for underwriting CDOs and CDOs squared when he was a paid advisor to the now infamous London AIG office . \nGorton is largely responsible for the notion of risk-free investment in CDOs -LRB- thanks to the AIG insurance institutional investors purchased -RRB- which is precisely what caused the current bubble and crash . \nIf the institutions could n't buy insurance at least the majority , if not the great majority , would have been a lot more cautious . \nInstead of learning from his mistake , he is trying to peddle the same crap to governments . \nThere is no hope for finance if anyone still takes Gorton seriously .

{"txt": "How to stop civil war Nicaragua and South Africa , not the US , should be the inspiration for the people framing Iraq 's constitution Tuesday 30 August 2005 11.05 BST Between the idea and the reality falls the shadow of occupation . \nWhatever the parliamentarians in Iraq do to try to prevent total meltdown , their efforts are compromised by the fact that their power grows from the barrel of someone else 's gun . \nWhen George Bush picked up the phone last week to urge the negotiators to sign the constitution , he reminded Iraqis that their representatives - though elected - remain the administrators of his protectorate . \nWhile US and British troops stay in Iraq , no government there can make an undisputed claim to legitimacy . \nNothing can be resolved in that country until our armies leave . \nThis is by no means the only problem confronting the people who drafted Iraq 's constitution . \nThe refusal by the Shias and the Kurds to make serious compromises on federalism , which threatens to deprive the central , Sunni-dominated areas of oil revenues , leaves the Sunnis with little choice but to reject the agreement in October 's referendum . \nWhat can the Iraqi parliament do now ? \nCan anything be done ? \nIt might be too late . \nBut it seems to me that the transitional assembly has one last throw of the dice . \nThis is to abandon the constitution it has signed , and Bush 's self-serving timetable , and start again with a different democratic design . \nThe problem with the way the constitution was produced is the problem afflicting almost all the world 's democratic processes . \nThe deliberations were back to front . \nFirst the members of the constitutional committee , shut inside the green zone , argue over every dot and comma ; then they present the whole thing -LRB- 25 pages in English translation -RRB- to the people for a yes or no answer . \nThe question and the answer are meaningless . \nAll politically conscious people , having particular interests and knowing that perfection in politics is impossible , will , on reading a complex document like this , see that it is good in some places and bad in others . \nThey might recognize some articles as being bad for them but good for society as a whole ; they might recognize others as being good or bad for almost everyone . \nWhat then does yes or no mean ? \nLet me be more precise . \nHow , for example , could anyone agree with both these statements , from articles 2 and 19 respectively ? \n`` Islam is the official religion of the state and is a basic source of legislation : no law can be passed that contradicts the undisputed rules of Islam . '' \n-LRB- In other words , the supreme authority in law is God . -RRB- \n`` The judiciary is independent , with no power above it other than the law . '' \nOr both these , from articles 14 and 148 ? \n`` Iraqis are equal before the law without discrimination because of sex , ethnicity , nationality , origin , color , religion , sect , belief , opinion or social or economic status '' ; `` Members of the presidential council must ... have left the dissolved party -LRB- the Ba'ath -RRB- at least 10 years before its fall if they were members in it . '' \nFaced with such contradictions , no thoughtful elector can wholly endorse or reject this document . \nOf course , this impossible choice is what we would have confronted -LRB- but at 10 times the length and a hundred times the complexity -RRB- had we been asked to vote on the European constitution . \nThe yes or no question put to us would have been just as stupid , and just as just as stupefying . \nIt treats us like idiots and - because we can not refine our responses - reduces us to idiots . \nBut while it would have merely enhanced our sense of alienation from the European project , for the Iraqis the meaninglessness of the question could be a matter of life and death . \nIf there is not a widespread sense of public ownership of the country 's political processes , and a widespread sense that political differences can be meaningfully resolved by democratic means , this empowers those who seek to resolve them otherwise . \nLast week George Bush , echoed on these pages by Bill Clinton 's former intelligence adviser Philip Bobbitt , compared the drafting process in Baghdad to the construction of the American constitution . \nIf they believe that the comparison commends itself to the people of Iraq , they are plainly even more out of touch than I thought . \nBut it should also be obvious that we now live in more sceptical times . \nWhen the US constitution was drafted , representative democracy was a radical and thrilling idea . \nNow it is an object of suspicion and even contempt , as people all over the world recognize that it allows us to change the management but not the firm . \nAnd one of the factors that have done most to engender public scepticism is the meaninglessness of the only questions we are ever asked . \nI read Labor 's manifesto before the last election and found good and bad in it . \nBut whether I voted for or against , I had no means to explain what I liked and what I did n't . \nDoes it require much imagination to see the link between our choice of meaningless absolutes and the Manichean worldview our leaders have evolved ? \nWe must decide at elections whether they are right or wrong - about everything . \nShould we then be surprised when they start talking about good and evil , friend and foe , being with them or against them ? \nAlmost two years ago Troy Davis , a democracy-engineering consultant , pointed out that if a constitutional process in Iraq was to engender trust and national commitment , it had to `` promote a culture of democratic debate '' . \nLike Professor Vivien Hart , of the University of Sussex , he argued that it should draw on the experiences of Nicaragua in 1986 , where 100,000 people took part in townhall meetings reviewing the draft constitution , and of South Africa , where the public made 2 million submissions to the drafting process . \nIn both cases , the sense of public ownership this fostered accelerated the process of reconciliation . \nNot only is your own voice heard in these public discussions , but you must also hear others . \nHearing them , you are confronted with the need for compromise . \nBut when negotiations are confined to the green zone 's black box , the Iraqis have no sense that the process belongs to them . \nBecause they are not asked to participate , they are not asked to understand where other people 's interests lie and how they might be accommodated . \nAnd when the whole thing goes belly up , it will be someone else 's responsibility . \nIf Iraq falls apart over the next couple of years , it would not be unfair , among other factors , to blame the fact that Davis and Hart were ignored . \nFor the people who designed Iraq 's democratic processes , history stopped in 1787 . \nDeliberative democracy is not a panacea . \nYou can have fake participatory processes just as you can have fake representative ones . \nBut it is hard to see why representation can not be tempered by participation . \nWhy should we be forbidden to choose policies , rather than just parties or entire texts ? \nCan we not be trusted ? \nIf not , then what is the point of elections ? \nThe age of purely representative democracy is surely over . \nIt is time the people had their say .

{"txt": "Dave Lee | 14:19 UK time , Monday , 25 January 2010 BBC World Service has begun broadcasting a daily 20-minute program for Haiti . \n \nThe service is aimed at providing information to people caught up in the devastation caused by the devastating earthquake in Haiti . \nThe program will be produced and edited by a BBC team in Miami . \nIn a special post for the Over To You blog , the BBC 's Nick Miles describes the challenges he and his team have had to overcome to put out the lifeline program : It 's been an extremely swift launch of a new radio service to say the least . \nIt was only about four days from the first ideas being jotted down on a piece of paper to the program , Connexion Haiti , going on air . \nBut it had to be quick . \nThe need for information in Haiti is acute and many of the local stations are still off air so Connexion Haiti is providing an important service for Haitians . \nWhen we arrived at the BBC offices here in Miami last Thursday we already knew we had two Haitian Americans living in Miami who would present the program . \nWe also had a means of transmitting the program via six FM frequencies across Haiti . \nThe frequencies are normally used by Radio France International for their broadcasts and they kindly stepped in to help the our program gone on air . \nConnexion Haiti now also goes out on short wave and can he heard via the BBC Caribbean service website . \nWe broadcast a trial program on Friday morning to test the signal and tell people how they could listen across Haiti and what they could expect from the program . \nSo , with some of the logistics sorted out , we then had to decide what to put in Connexion Haiti . \nA man listens to a radio at a refugee camp in Port-au-Prince , Haiti . \nPicture : Associated Press We knew this was would be a lifeline service for Haitians and we needed to provide as much up-to-the-minute information as possible about where people could find food aid , clean water , medical assistance and shelter . \nWe pulled together that information from , among other sources , our BBC correspondents in Haiti along with the main aid organizations and the US military . \nWe set about getting a list of people we could interview in the Haitian language , Creole . \nWe wanted to speak to as many people as we could who were working for the relief program in Haiti to give an idea of where the new distribution points for aid were and where new field hospitals were situated . \nBut we 've also used the interviews to broadcast appeals from the humanitarian organizations , specifically appeals for people to remain calm and to make sure they do n't block any of the the main roads that might prevent aid getting through . \nConnexion Haiti is also about hearing from ordinary Haitians caught up in the earthquake to find our how they 're coping and what they need . \nTo make this happen we set up a dedicated email address for our listeners , along with a number they could text and another where they could leave recorded messages . \nSo far the response has been encouraging . \nWe 've received texts emails and calls from Haitians saying that they 're listening to the program . \nSome have told us how they survived the earthquake while sadly members of their family did not . \nOthers have left telephone numbers so that loved ones can get in touch . \nOthers have just emailed to say how important the service is for them because they know that the world cares about what 's happened in Haiti . \nWe 've tried to broadcast as many of these messages as we can . \nThe program 's only twenty minutes long , and in that short time we want to get as much crucial information to people as possible but we 've also tried to include items that show the people of Haiti that people around the world are thinking about them and taking concrete actions to help . \nIn our first broadcast , for example , we ended the program with the music of Haitian pop star Wyclef Jean playing at an international charity concert for Haiti . \nHe bellowed out his solidarity with his compatriots and perhaps that in some small way will give psychological boost to the people of Haiti who are living such desperate times . \nNick Miles is Producer , BBC Connexion Haiti Over To You is your chance to have your say about the BBC World Service and its programs . \nIt airs at 10:40 and 23:40 every Saturday , and at 02:40 on Sunday -LRB- GMT -RRB- . \nSend the team your feedback by email -LRB- overtoyou@bbc.co.uk -RRB- , telephone -LRB- 44144960900 0 -RRB- , SMS -LRB- 447786 202006 -RRB- or by leaving comments on this blog . \nI BELIEVE THE cooporate effort of aid workers is the solution Thanks , for the support regarding the news to the people of Haiti -- in the recent Earthquake and providing a support system ...

{"txt": "There are not many newspaper articles that can genuinely claim to have changed the world for the better . \nBut on Sunday , 28 May 1961 , The Observer published a campaigning piece on the front of its Weekend Review section . \nThe article was entitled ` The Forgotten Prisoners ' and it was by Peter Benenson , a 40-year old Eton-educated London lawyer . \nBenenson had been angered after learning about two Portuguese students who had been arrested and imprisoned for seven years after drinking a toast to liberty in a Lisbon cafe during the Salazar dictatorship . \nAs Benenson later said : ` That so enraged me that I walked up the steps of St Martin-in-the-Fields , out of the Underground , and went in to see what could really be done effectively to mobilise world opinion . ' \nHis solution seemed simple : to bombard the Portuguese regime with written protests . \nAs Martin Ennals , a future Amnesty secretary-general observed later , it was ` an amazing contention that prisoners of conscience could be released by writing letters to governments ' . \nBut rather than have just one campaign for one country , why not draw public attention to the plight of political and religious prisoners throughout the world ? \nThis was the basis of his Observer article , which took the shape of a series of letters published as an ` Appeal for Amnesty ' . \nHis article began : ` Open your newspaper - any day of the week - and you will find a report from somewhere in the world of someone being imprisoned , tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government . \nThe newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence . \nYet if these feelings of disgust all over the world could be united into common action , something effective could be done . ' \nHe could not have predicted how right he has proved to be . \nBenenson had intended his campaign to run for a year , but the response to his article was overwhelming . \nThe term ` prisoner of conscience ' , which he coined , soon became common currency and the movement 's logo , a candle surrounded by barbed wire , became a worldwide symbol of hope . \nAmnesty 's campaigns have saved countless prisoners from torture or death . \nFrom South Africa , Chile and Uganda to Iraq , Burma and China , Amnesty 's work has helped secure the release of political prisoners and highlighted human rights violations . \nCloser to home Amnesty has also been critical of policies of the former prime minister , Margaret Thatcher , and more recently Tony Blair 's anti-terrorist legislation . \nIrene Khan , its present secretary general , said yesterday : ` His vision gave birth to human rights activism . \nPeter Benenson 's life was a courageous testament to his visionary commitment to fight injustice around the world . \nHe brought light into the darkness of prisons , the horror of torture chambers and tragedy of death camps around the world . \n` This was a man whose conscience shone in a cruel and terrifying world , who believed in the power of ordinary people to bring about extraordinary change and , by creating Amnesty International , he gave each of us the opportunity to make a difference . ' \nThe Leader of the House of Commons , Peter Hain , a long-time campaigner against the former apartheid regime in South Africa , led the political tributes last night . \n` He lit a torch for human rights which Amnesty International has kept burning across the world in being constantly vigilant about abuses , ' Hain said . \nIn Amnesty 's first few years Benenson 's energy was vital to its success . \nHe provided much of its funding and was involved in all aspects of the organization . \n` At that time we were still putting our toes in the water and learning as we went on , ' he later said . \n` We tried every technique of publicity and we were very grateful for the widespread help of journalists and television crews throughout the world who not only sent us information about the names of prisoners but also , whenever they could , gave space to stories about prisoners . ' \nAmnesty 's membership is now more than a million , with supporters in more than 160 countries and territories . \nIt has dealt with the cases of 47,000 prisoners of conscience and other victims of human rights violation . \nMore than 45,000 of these are now closed . \nIn 1977 Amnesty International was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its tireless fight against injustice . \nFormer prisoner of conscience Julio de Pena Valdez , a trade union leader in the Dominican Republic , has spoken of the impact of an Amnesty letter-writing campaign . \n` When the 200 letters came , the guards gave me back my clothes . \nThen the next 200 letters came and the prison director came to see me . \nWhen the next pile of letters arrived , the director got in touch with his superior . \nThe letters kept coming and coming - 3,000 of them . \nThe president was informed . \n` The letters still kept arriving and the president called the prison and told them to let me go . ' \nBenenson was born on 31 July 1921 , the grandson of the Russian-Jewish banker Grigori Benenson . \nHe later converted to Catholicism . \nHe was tutored privately by WH Auden , then went to Eton and Oxford , where he studied history . \nHis flair for controversy emerged early , when his complaint to the headmaster of Eton about the poor quality of the school 's food prompted a letter to his mother warning of her son 's ` revolutionary tendencies . \nAt age 16 , he launched his first campaign : to get school support , during the Spanish Civil War , for the newly-formed Spanish Relief Committee which was helping Republican war orphans . \nHe himself ` adopted ' one of the babies , helping to pay for its support . \nHis concern about political imprisonment and mistreatment was inspired by Arthur Koestler 's Spanish Testament , which described the horrors of imprisonment and threatened execution by the Fascists . \nIt was this concern that led to his next campaign - the plight of Jews who had fled from Hitler 's Germany . \nDespite some opposition , he succeeded in getting his school friends and their families to raise # 4,000 to bring two young German Jews to Britain . \nAfter leaving Eton , he helped his politically committed mother find homes in various countries for refugee children who arrived in London . \nThe Trades Union Congress sent him to Spain as its observer at the trials of trade unionists in the early Fifties . \nHe was appalled by what he saw in the courtrooms and in the prisons . \nIn one instance he was so outraged by the proceedings that he drew up a list of complaints with which he confronted the trial judge over dinner . \nThe trial ended with acquittals , a rarity in fascist Spain . \nBenenson , who had been ill for some time , died on Friday evening at the John Radcliffe Hospital , Oxford . \nLighting a candle in St Martin-in-the Fields church to mark the twentieth anniversary of Amnesty , he said : ' I have lit this candle , in the words of Shakespeare , ` against oblivion ' - so that the forgotten prisoners should always be remembered . \nWe work in Amnesty against oblivion .

'' \nBesser said the CDC is sending out testing kits to U.S. states that will allow individual state labs to confirm their own cases of swine flu . \n`` We are in the process of rolling out testing capability in every state , '' Besser said . \nH1N1 swine flu is not classified as a pandemic virus . \n`` We have a small number of cases , but we do not have a large number of cases , said Besser . \nBut the symptoms it causes are virtually identical to regular seasonal flu , as well as a host of other respiratory illnesses from the common cold to more exotic coronaviruses . \nA quick on-the-spot test can tell doctors if a patient has influenza and some will tell whether it is type A. But more sophisticated tests must be done to show whether it is an H1N1 , the type that includes both one of the seasonal influenza strains and the new swine flu strain . \nEven further testing will show if it is the new strain , but this requires either a process called PCR , which amplifies and analyzes the genetic material of the virus , or using a test called an antibody test to see if the patient 's immune system has mounted a defense against the virus . \n`` What is being rolled out right now by the CDC is a specific test for this new virus , '' said the CDC 's Dr. Lyle Petersen . \nIt will fit onto the PCR platform used in state health departments for influenza surveillance and will produce a result in a matter of hours , Petersen said . \nBut it is not something a doctor or clinic can do . \n`` You need a fancy machine to do it , '' he said in a telephone interview . \nFor now , the CDC recommends only that people with flulike symptoms who have some kind of recent travel to Mexico or who have been in close contact with a known swine flu patient should get the test . \nPetersen said there is a limited amount of material , called reagent , that can be used to make the PCR tests work . \nAnd if the disease is spreading , that will become clear anyhow . \n`` No one is going to recommend doing wholesale testing anyway . \nIf you have a giant outbreak of flu you do n't need to test every single person if you know what it is , '' he said . \n-LRB- Reporting by Maggie Fox , Editing by Sandra Maler -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/h1n1_reuters/rsd/H1N1_reuters__2009-04-30__910.rsd.txt.app-auth-final"}
{"txt": "-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three key Republican senators said Monday they oppose a proposal by Sen. Joe Lieberman , I-Connecticut , to arm rebels in Libya fighting Moammar Gadhafi . \nThey had mixed thoughts on whether the United States should be involved in imposing a no-fly zone in that country to protect protestors from attacks by Libyan war planes . \nI would not suggest either of those courses for the moment , said Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee who indicated U.S. involvement could lead to war . \nDepending upon the method of delivery and what we decide to do we could decide to have a war in Libya to join the war in Afghanistan and Iraq . \nSen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , a member of the Armed Services Committee , said she would be leery of providing arms at this point but said she supports a no-fly zone . \nI do believe our allies may be able to join together with us to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya to help protect the people from Gadhafi , she said . \nAny actions that we take I believe should be in concert with our allies . \nSen. Lindsay Graham , R-South Carolina , who is also on the Armed Services Committee , credited the diplomatic efforts underway by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and suggested the U.S. work with the United Nations to stiffen and enforce sanctions against Libya . \nProviding arms , I m not sure that helps us , Graham said . \nI don t know if you could control right now who would get the arms . \nWhat I would suggest is that we really keep implementing U.N. sanctions on the economic side , on the travel side , go after assets , Graham added . \nAnd a no fly zone would make a lot of sense to me . \nThe three senators spoke in a Capitol hallway after a vote on the Senate floor . \nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid , R-Nevada , said he has asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , D-Kentucky , about Lieberman 's proposal to arm the Libyan rebels in a no-fly zone . \nMcConnell said he has asked Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee , to brief Senate Republicans at their weekly policy lunch in the Capitol Tuesday about his trip to Egypt over the weekend . \nLieberman traveled to Egypt with McCain , and they appeared together on CNN Sunday . \nMcCain supported the idea of a no-fly zone but did not say if he supports providing arms to Libyans fighting Gadhafi . \nA no fly zone is a UN scenario ! \nFebruary 28 , 2011 09:57 pm at 9:57 pm | Liebermans take on anything in the middle east is an opinion that no one should listen to , and Bomb Bomb McCain lost all judgement and respect the day he brought the Palin Plague to the forefront . \nLieberman works for another country and can not be trusted and starting another war is just another way Republicans think they can get out of creating jobs like they promised to get back in the house . \nFebruary 28 , 2011 10:11 pm at 10:11 pm | What is it with Mccain and Lieberman ? \nWe cant even afford these other two wars we are fighting , and they are ready to get neck deep in Libya ? \nThese guys just dont get it . \nFebruary 28 , 2011 10:11 pm at 10:11 pm | GOP = Greed Over People P.S.

{"txt": "PARIS | Wed Oct 26 , 2011 7:09 am EDT PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will almost certainly fall under the pressure of protests and sanctions , but it will take time due to the complexity of internal and regional politics , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Wednesday . \nWith a crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Syria now seven months old , Western powers including France are relying on a combination of sanctions and diplomatic pressure to weaken Assad 's hold on power . \nThe European Union widened sanctions against Assad and the Syrian state after China and Russia blocked an attempt by Western powers to bring about a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning violence against protesters . \n`` It 's true that in New York -LRB- at the United Nations -RRB- we were blocked , and that is a stain on the Security Council , which said almost nothing about this barbaric repression , '' Juppe said on France Inter radio . \n`` This will end with the fall of the regime , it is nearly unavoidable , but unfortunately it could take time because the situation is complex , because there is a risk of civil war between Syrian factions , because surrounding Arab countries do not want us to intervene .

{"txt": "YYemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh speaks during a joint news conference in Sanaa , March 21 , 2011 . \nCredit : Reuters\\/Yemeni TV via Reuters TV By Cynthia Johnston and Mohamed Sudam SANAA | Tue Mar 22 , 2011 3:31 pm EDT SANAA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Yemen 's president said on Tuesday his country would descend into civil war if he were forced to quit and Washington voiced concern about instability in the Arab state that has become an al Qaeda stronghold . \nSeven weeks of unrelenting anti-government protests and defections among the ruling elite have piled pressure on Ali Abdullah Saleh , a U.S. ally against radical Islamist ambitions in the Arabian peninsula , to step down immediately after 32 years in power . \nBut an aide said he would leave office only after organizing parliamentary polls and establishing democratic institutions , by January 2012 -- a declaration the opposition promptly rejected . \n`` Ali Abdullah Saleh does not seek power , '' Saleh 's media secretary Ahmed al-Sufi told Reuters . \n`` Ali Abdullah Saleh will not leave without knowing who he is handing over to . '' \nThe United States , grappling with the diplomatic fallout of uprisings and uncertainty across the Arab world , voiced rare public alarm about the situation in Yemen . \n`` We are obviously concerned about the instability in Yemen , '' U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said . \nHis chief concern was to avoid `` diversion of attention '' from opposing al Qaeda there . \nOpposition spokesman Mohammed al-Sabry , rejecting Saleh 's offer to go by January 2012 , said the coming hours would be decisive . \nIn speeches to army officers and tribal leaders in Sanaa , Saleh said Yemen faced a danger of civil war and disintegration because of efforts to stage a `` coup '' against his rule . \n`` You have an agenda to tear down the country , the country will be divided into three instead of two ... -LRB- parts -RRB- . \nA southern part , northern part and a middle part . \nThis is what is being sought by defectors against ... unity , '' he said , referring to northern Shi'ite rebels and al Qaeda militants . \n`` Those who want to climb up to power through coups should know that this is out of the question . \nThe homeland will not be stable , there will be a civil war , a bloody war . \nThey should carefully consider this , '' Saleh told army commanders . \nPresidential guards loyal to Saleh surrounded an air force battalion in the coastal city of Hudaida after its commander said he supported the protesters . \nA presidential guard and a soldier died in clashes between the two forces in the southern coastal city of Mukalla late on Monday , medical sources said . \nIn southern Abyan province , troops clashed with al Qaeda militants , killing 12 and wounding five , state media said . \nLiquefied natural gas producer Yemen LNG has told customers that unrest could lead to supply disruptions , leading stakeholder Total said . \nWestern countries fear the political crisis could hasten a slide into failed nation status for a country that borders the world 's biggest oil exporter , Saudi Arabia , and major shipping routes . \nOne scenario could see the country split into separate zones along tribal , military or regional lines . \nAl Qaeda has already used Yemen to attempt attacks in Saudi Arabia and the United States in the past two years . \nThe Shi'ite Houthi movement has staged a number of revolts against Saleh . \nOne opposition leader offered Saleh the prospect of secure retirement if , like Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , he would go quietly , unlike Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . \n`` He should n't follow the style of Gaddafi by destroying the country and killing people , '' Yassin Noman , rotating head of Yemen 's opposition coalition said . \n`` After this long term of governing , he should say : Thank you my people , I leave you peacefully . '' \n`` I know the morality of Yemeni people . \nIf he left peacefully , they will look at him as a real leader . \nHe will be able to live wherever he likes , '' Noman told Reuters . \n`` They will ensure him a very nice life . \nHis dignity will be kept . '' \nSeveral generals and officials have abandoned Saleh this week after a massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators on Friday On Tuesday , Abdel-Malik Mansour , Yemen 's envoy to the Arab League , told Al Arabiya television he was siding with protesters . \nAbdul-Rahman al-Iryani , whom Saleh sacked as environment minister on Sunday along with the rest of the cabinet , said on Facebook he was joining `` the revolutionaries . '' \nDefections have included generals , tribal leaders , diplomats and ministers . \nThey have gained momentum since gunmen loyal to Saleh opened fire on demonstrators in the capital Sanaa on Friday . \nFifty-two people were killed . \nA crowd of around 10,000 gathered outside Sanaa University in a rally that has been repeated for the past seven weeks , with youth playing a key role . \nSaleh offered dialogue with young people on Tuesday , and state media said he was sympathetic to their problems . \nProtesters , however , have been uncompromising . \nEchoing demands that have been satisfied in Tunisia and Egypt and continue to be heard elsewhere across the region , they chanted : `` The people want the fall of regime . '' \nThe body of one of those killed on Friday was brought to the protesters before burial . \n`` The people want a trial for the butcher , '' they shouted , hurling abuse at Saleh . \nFrance on Monday became the first Western power to call publicly for Saleh to stand down . \nForeign Minister Alain Juppe described his departure as `` unavoidable . '' \nYemeni Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi returned from Riyadh on Monday where Saleh sent him to seek Saudi-led Gulf Arab mediation . \nA diplomatic source said there had been no indication of success in the effort to involve those countries . \nTribal sources said tribal sheikhs had embarked on mediation efforts on Tuesday , focusing on a potential agreement that protests could continue , violence against protesters would be investigated and a smooth transition of power would take place . \nNo more details were available . \nOn Tuesday , soldiers were preventing cars driving along roads close to Saleh 's presidential palace in Sanaa . \nLate on Monday night residents heard explosions and shooting near a presidential place in Yemen 's eastern port of Mukalla . \nGeneral Ali Mohsen , commander of the northwest military zone and Saleh 's kinsman from the al-Ahmar clan , said on Monday he was backing the protesters and warned of civil war . \nOn Tuesday Mohsen -- seen by northern rebels as a ruthless military leader -- declared in a statement read out to the protesters camping out in Sanaa that the `` era of military coups is over '' and vowed to protect the `` youth revolution . '' \nTanks were deployed outside the presidential palace in the southern port city of Aden , focal point of a separatist movement hoping to escape Yemen 's myriad problems by recreating the former South Yemen that feels cheated by unity under Saleh . \nOpponents complain that Yemen under Saleh has failed to meet the basic needs of the country 's 23 million people . \nUnemployment is around 35 percent and 50 percent for young people . \nOil wealth is dwindling and water is running out . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThere are turmoil in Yemen , Bahrain and Libya . \nWhy in the world would France , the US and etc. western countries only declaired a war to Libya ?!

' \nTo speak of the ` Auden generation ' is to perpetuate a myth of the Thirties . \nThe majority of the population , including the majority of Labor supporters , never read an Auden poem or hitched a ride with communism . \nWhat is meant is the ` progressive ' middle-class left : publishers , authors , academics , teachers , liberal journalists , the odd lawyer and odder advocate of various forms of alternative life styles . \nPeople like me , in short . \nIn their later years , most tried a defense which Auden was too honest , and too filled with disgust at his younger self , to advance . \nOur priority was fighting fascism , the excuse-making ran . \nWe were faced with a psychopathic movement of the extreme right which was dripping in blood . \nIt looks bad now that we went along with Stalin , but we were socialists and he called what he was doing socialism , and in any event we had other priorities . \nToday 's middle-class left is made up of the same types as 70 years ago . \nThe faults of small-mindedness and self-righteousness and the virtues of instinctive suspicion of the British establishment and sympathy for the British underdog have n't changed either . \nThe fact is that the middle-class left is made up of the same types as 70 years ago . \n`` The left is not the same , '' said Yusuf al-Qaradawi . \nWhen Tony Blair goes we will have the first Labor leadership election without a serious left-wing candidate . \nIndeed , it is impossible to imagine what a serious left-wing candidate would look like and what his or her program might be . \nI 'm sure that any halfway competent political philosopher could rip the assumptions of modern middle-class left-wingery apart . \nWhy is it right to support a free market in sexual relationships but oppose free-market economics , for instance ? \nBut his criticisms would have little impact . \nIt 's like a religion : the contradictions are obvious to outsiders but do n't disturb the faithful . \nYou believe when you 're in its warm embrace . \nAlas , I 'm out . \nLast week , after 44 years of regular church-going , the bell tolled , the book was closed and the candle was extinguished . \nThe officiating bishop was Peter Wilby , a former editor of the New Statesman and a friend of long-standing , who delivered his anathema in the Guardian . \nThe immediate heresy was a piece I 'd written about how difficult the courts made it to deport suspected Islamist terrorists . \nAs I 'd campaigned to protect asylum seekers in the past , Wilby used the article as damning evidence of ' a rightwards lurch ' . \nThe old bat did n't understand that genuine asylum seekers are the victims of the world 's greatest criminals - four million fled Saddam Hussein - not criminals themselves . \nEven if he 'd grasped that the Mail was wrong and real refugees were n't villains , I doubt it would have made a difference . \nMy mortal sin had been to question ` harshly the motives of the anti-war movement ' , and to that I had to plead guilty . \nThe least attractive characteristic of the middle-class left - one shared with the Thatcherites - is its refusal to accept that its opponents are sincere . \nThe legacy of Marx and Freud allows it to dismiss criticisms as masks which hide corruption , class interests , racism , sexism - any motive can be implied except fundamental differences of principle . \nWilby went through a long list of what could have motivated mine and similar ` betrayals ' . \nPerhaps we became right wing as we got older . \nPerhaps we wanted to stick our snouts into the deep troughs of the Tory press . \nPerhaps taking out a mortgage committed us to the capitalist system or having children encouraged petit bourgeois individualism of the most anti-social kind . \nGenerously in light of the above charge sheet , he plumped for the conclusion that our restless minds just got bored with the ` straitjacket ' of left-wing thought . \nWe left the slog of building a better world to the decent plodders . \nGenerous to me , and over-generous to allegedly left-wing thought . \nWhat he and a large part of the mainstream liberal-left do n't and wo n't confront is that they have become the fellow travellers of the psychopathic far-right . \nMany emotions have been stirred by the grisly spectacle - anger , scorn and incredulity among them - but boredom , no , never boredom . \nAs in the 1930s , there 's little doubt that few apart from George Galloway and others in the gruesome leadership of the anti-war movement were keen on saluting Saddam Hussein . \nThe reason why one million people marched through London without one mounting a platform to express solidarity with the victims of fascism was that it never occurred to them that there were people in Iraq who shared their values . \nIt felt like nit-picking to point this out at the time . \nWars are usually worth opposing , especially capricious wars advocated by a slippery Prime Minister in alliance with a repellent US President . \nBut arguments have their own dynamic . \nIf you start by refusing to look Baathism or Islamism in the face , the logic of blaming everything on Tony Blair and George W Bush pushes you into making ever more excuses for the extreme right . \nAuden noticed a retreat from universal principles in the 1930s - communism was fine in ` semi-barbaric ' Russia but would have been a screaming outrage in a civilised country . \nHe should have been alive today . \nWith no socialism to provide international solidarity , good motives of tolerance and respect for other cultures have had the unintended consequence of leading a large part of post-modern liberal opinion into the position of 19th-century imperialists . \nIt is presumptuous and oppressive to suggest that other cultures want the liberties we take for granted , their argument runs . \nSo it may be , but believe that and the upshot is that democracy , feminism and human rights become good for whites but not for browns and brown-skinned people who contradict you are the tools of the neo-conservatives . \nOn the other hand when confronted with a movement of contemporary imperialism - Islamism wants an empire from the Philippines to Gibraltar - and which is tyrannical , homophobic , misogynist , racist and homicidal to boot , they feel it is valid because it is against Western culture . \nIt expresses its feelings in a regrettably brutal manner perhaps , but that ca n't hide its authenticity . \nThe result of this inversion of principles has been that liberals ca n't form alliances with the victims of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan or Iraq any more than the Auden generation could form alliances with the victims of Stalinism . \nThis is n't simply about international relations . \nWho is going to help the victims of religious intolerance in Britain 's immigrant communities ? \nNot the Liberal Democrats , who have never once offered support to liberal and democrats in Iraq . \nNor an anti-war left which prefers to embrace a Muslim Association of Britain and Yusuf al-Qaradawi who believe that Muslims who freely decide to change their religion or renounce religion should be executed . \nIf the Archbishop of Canterbury were to suggest the same treatment for renegade Christians all hell would break loose . \nBut as the bigotry comes from ` the other ' there is silence . \nPerhaps it will break soon . \nThere always was far more disquiet on the left at this ` rightwards lurch ' than the Guardian or Radio 4 admitted . \nIf my emails are a guide , the London bombs have added a practical reason for breaking with the consensus : now they 're trying to kill us . \nEven if people think that the Iraq war has made Britain a bigger target , they are still confronted with a fascistic cult of murder and self-murder which allows no compromise . \nThe thing to watch for with fellow travellers is what shocks them into pulling the emergency cord and jumping off the train . \nI know some will stay on to the terminus , and when the man with the rucksack explodes his bomb their dying words will be : ` It 's not your fault . \nI blame Tony Blair . ' \nMy advice to my former comrades is to struggle out of your straitjackets and get off at the next station . \nIt would be good to see you on this side of the barrier .

{"txt": "They can thank the age of social media . \nThere s the fake Twitter account , BPGlobalPR , posing as the public relations mouthpiece for an arrogant powerhouse . \nToday it tweeted its 184,466 followers : Attention lazy fishermen ! \nIf you won t clean our mess , we re taking your money . \nThey also produced this fake press conference . \nYouTube , not around in 1989 , is brimming with satirical videos targeting BP . \nThere 's BP spills coffee , now at more than 9 million views . \nSpoof ads are also hot contenders for `` viral '' status : Oil is natural and the slickly produced BP Bringing People Together are two of the more popular . \nParody t-shirts are a dime a dozeon on the Internet , with slogans such as BP . \nWe re bringing oil to American shores . \nOr the oil-smeared BP Cares . \nAre Americans being too hard on the company ? \nThe spill in the Gulf of Mexico has so far cost the company $ 3 billion in clean-up costs . \nOn a daily basis , BP repeats its commitment to taking full responsibility and will pay for all legitimate claims . \nBut the public is ruthless , and a question emerges , are critics hiding behind the anonymity of the blogosphere ? \nThe Boycott BP group on Facebook is climbing with more than 450,000 followers -- but actual protest rallies draw only a fraction of that . \nEarlier this week , the UK s Metro unleashed this doozie : a rare , early 1970s board game called `` Offshore Oil Strike '' produced by BP and partner Printabox where tycoons compete at exploring for oil and avoid hazard cards which threaten rig blowouts and oil spill costs . \nNo joke , although an odd self parody given the current situation . \nThe late Texan columnist Molly Ivins wrote , `` Satire is traditionally the weapon of the powerless against the powerful . '' \nPhoto shows a protester holding a syrup covered plastic earth ball to protest against the BP oil spill on the North side of the White House in Washington June 16 , 2010 . \nREUTERS\\/Larry Downing Come on Americans , this is your backyard ! \nThis is an upward flow against gravity that pulls down . \nIt can be stopped by some easy tricks on fluid dynamics using concepts of surface transport of particles . \nBubbling flow upward can be clogged by high density objects coming down by gravity pull . \nInstead of doing a junk shot with gulf balls and shredded tires they were supposed to put high density and sinking geometry to clog the well . \nWe do it a lot in Soil Science and the Dust Bowl provides insights on surface transport of particles by erosion regarding detachment , transport , and deposition . \nHydrology is being curbed in the patenting affairs and technological development deeply missing now to solve simple problems like clogging a spilling well . \nThe use of golf balls in the junk shot is a clear evidence that the experts have no handle on deep Hydrology . \nI am not surprised since a sort of scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being constantly violated by lay people as Patent Examiners , Patent Attorneys , and Scientists . \nTry to find any address of wick\\/wicking on Hydrology textbooks and you will see that this oil spill is something that could have been stopped on the day ONE if science were respected and honored . \nUSPTO has near 6,000 Patent Examiners and it already confirmed that none of them is a Hydrologist ! \nThis OIL SPILL is a consequence of a bunch of people pretending to be smart overstepping the boundaries of a classic science called HYDROLOGY . \nMr. Obama assigned Dr. Regina Benjamin 42 lbs overweight to take care of your health system . \nA person near obese in the health system that can not help herself is going to provide Americans insights to shed weight and be healthy . \nThis way Americans are becoming 85 % obese by 2040 . \nI suggested Mr. Obama to resign because my advanced breakthrough scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being violated by flawed patents that even do not work . \nWhy to ignore science ? \nI already sent Mr. Obama 14 lettters regarding violations of Hydrology getting no reply . \nMy doubt is if people at the White House read English or people around there do not need to care about their country outcome . \nJust imagine if the well could be clogged in few hours by appropriate approach making gravity pull heavy objects downward on a bubbling upward flow with variable flow velocity due to the dragging effect of well casing . \nThe relief wells may not work as clay in the mud can only clog tiny pores but fail on cracks and fissures . \nWhat is the chance that PB hires any Soil Scientist in the technical staff ? \nWhat is the chance that BP Engineers ever learned about Soil Erosion to understand detachment , transport , and deposition of particles in a dynamic flow ? \nI believe this entire nightmare is preventable and consequence of a failing leadership you have . \nHow would I stop the spill ? \nEasily running some trials with a visible display employing translucent 22 in pipes with similar upward flow and check the dragging effect on many particle sizes and formats . \nThe bubbling effect should increase fall by reducing the fluid density , as well as variable radial flow velocity which is higher in the center and lower around the containment case as a stationary surface . \nWhen we start injecting the junk shot we know what to expect and change the particles sizes and formats as the velocity of spill reduces by the this downward effect from the falling particles . \nLower and lower velocity suggests smaller and smaller particles until clay can be used to seal tiny pores inside the well lumen definitively . \nWhat am I charging for it ? \nI just want USPTO to stop violating my scientific discovery US pat . \n6,766,817 with flawed patents that even do not work shamefully harming and dishonoring HYDROLOGY . \nI got PhD at Penn State University and Bill Clinton was the speecher of my commencement on May 10 , 1996 . \nCNN is controlling info by removing comments on its website . \nI am curious who takes advantages by this ongoing catastrophe . \nThe Valdez was a tanker that crashed with a finite amount of oil , not comparable . \nThe bottom line was and is BP is responsible to stop the leak in a timely manner . \nThree months and they are still battling this mess . \nThey were not prepared with solutions and that 's irresponsible . \nThe earned and deserve bad PR . \nPosted by GSH10 | Report as abusive Are Americans bullying BP ? \nRead Obama 's lips , the fish stinks from its head . \nI think the problem is that all the actions to date have been undertaken with the intent to save possible production from the well ; if they were really serious about stopping it they would 've blown it up the day after the rig sank -- period full stop . \nNo phony caps or junk shots , but a straight detonation -- the physics of explosions are much better understood than the technology of deepwater robotics . \nWould n't be so bad if the same thing did n't happen twenty-one years ago , trying the same tricks that did n't work , for months upon months . \nDifferent company , same issue . \nIt 's as if , 1 -RRB- they 're clueless , or 2 -RRB- they do n't care . \nBP has a history of playing fast and loose , paying fines as they go . \nAre we bullying them ? \nDo they deserve it ? \nIt 's absurd for anyone to expect any amount of sympathy for a soulless corporation , when the livelihood of so many ` little people ' are completely ruined because of their -LRB- BPs -RRB- mistake . \nBP 's first priority is BP in this case , not anything else . \nWhen companies made mistakes , they all rushed to the site to apologise ; Hayward stated he wanted his life back . \nA tearful apology might have eased the American anger a little , but their behavior is less then commendable . \nAre Americans bullying BP ? \nWould it be called bullying if a man got irate because someone threw a bunch of junk in their back garden ? \nThere 's a difference between spilling the rubbish bin in your own back garden and doing the same in the neighbor 's garden . \nThe author clearly supports big business despite the extreme damage done . \nThis is not something that BP can simply apologize for and expect to move on . \nThis is an ecological disaster that could and probably will have an effect on generations to come . \nIMO BP has not suffered nearly the damage that it has caused . \nAlthough there are efforts , BP has not returned things to the way they were before its negligence caused this tragedy . \nUntil they do , I say let the bullying go on ! \nBP -- BIG PROFITS BEFORE PEOPLE AND ENVIRONMENT I think that we are being too hard on BP . \nyes they made some bad decisions along the way but most of the actual drill work was subcontracted and all done to current law and standard practice . \nIt could have happened to any company and if we do n't change current requirements and improve technology it will given time ! \nEase up everyone ... I live along the Gulf Coast and I will forgive . \nFrom an external , non-US , perspective America gives the impression that it no longer understands how business works and how it can be regulated ; all the way from the banks to the energy industry . \nAs evidenced by the banks , and now the oil industry , this leaves an open gap for those wishing to make profits or cut risky cost corners for their own or their corporate benefit to step through . \nThis lack of integration and understanding in government -LRB- eg drilling moratorium , Browner 's unlimited liability proposals etc. -RRB- leaves the US open to powerful non-democratic lobbies , like the Environmental Lobby , who have successfully campaigned against nuclear power , coal and now have the opportunity to shut-dwon the oil industry . \nWIth a lack of leadership in government there is only one way this can go . \nUnfortunately , the environmental zealots do not understand the unintended consequences risks , as they probably do n't with Climate Change hypotheses , of losing industrial capacity , jobs and wealth . \nLuckily , in a decade or so , we wo n't have to listen to America 's hegemonistic arrogance as we will have China and India with enough power to ensure that the new wealthy countries ' views are heard to the detriment of the US . \nIn this sense BP , as an individual entity , is not being targeted but the whole of the fossil fuel society is a target . \nI wonder if , in 10 years or so , the US will be rich enough to buy all those wind turbines and solar panels from China and India that they will need for their Green Revolution ? \nVery good points here . \nBeing involved in social media and passionate about Sustainability this is always a difficult question . \nIs the activism on the street more effective then online , or what do you do best to make your voice heard . \nI believe that we as stakeholders need to practice all of the possibilities we have at our disposal to make our voices and opinion heard . \nIn the the case of BP this is even more so the case because of the scale of the disaster . \nWe need to use all channels we have to oppose corporate malpractice . \nRight now I am using the blogosphere but next week I am doing something different to make my voice heard . \nThat is what I call sustained stakeholder activism . \nSurely this piece is a joke . \nDefinition of bully : To force one 's way aggressively or by intimidation . \nIf only we \\* could \\* bully BP ! \nClearly no one can make them do much . \nBut that 's what happens when you go far too far in deregulating industry . \nSpeaking of ... `` yes they made some bad decisions along the way but most of the actual drill work was subcontracted and all done to current law and standard practice . \nIt could have happened to any company and if we don t change current requirements and improve technology it will given time ! '' \nBut it 's BP and their oily brethren that routinely pay high-powered lobbyists big bucks to lobby in DC to lessen restrictions in every way possible . \nToo many of people have bought into the ridiculous concept that deregulation is the key to a bright and glittering economic future . \nAnd the average lawmaker who 's being offered huge campaign contributions from industry will happily hop aboard the corporate gravy train unless there 's a loud enough outcry from mainstream voters to make it too dangerous to their re-election bids . \nIn short , BP and the rest of the industry has worked very hard for years to dictate `` current law and practice . '' \nDeregulation does n't happen by accident . \nAnd deregulation does n't favor business . \nIt favors crooked business . \nBut it can also create such an uneven playing field that it can put out of business those honest players that actually try to deal fairly with their employees and their customers and essentially try to be good corporate citizens . \nAre you serious , Reuters ? \nThis to me is a piece that 's written just to be controversial because that draws attention . \nIt 's simply offensive . \nNext time , try asking a real question like , `` Are Americans Being Bullied By Corporations ? '' \nNo , not even close as much as they should ! \nAs a non-US and non-UK citizen I observe this whole BP mess right from the very beginning and am shocked about BPs incompetence , ignorance and ruthlessness . \nBut there are still some positive aspects in it too . \n1 -RRB- Americans are starting to wake up and become more interested in alternative energies 2 -RRB- The catastrophic oil spills in other regions of the world are on the reporters lists too 3 -RRB- Germany will become the first G20 country run 100 % by renewable\\/alternative energies by 2050 , 18 % by now , to say `` bye bye '' to big oil , coal , natural gas and nuclear power . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nShe has been working for Reuters in Toronto since January 2003 .

{"txt": "Mexico to re-test swine flu cases The widow of swine flu victim Gerardo Leyva first heard of the cause of his death when an Associated Press reporter contacted her , the news agency says Stricter swine flu tests have cut the number of confirmed deaths in Mexico , where the virus was first reported , from 20 to seven , authorities say . \nBut officials warned the number of deaths likely to have been caused by swine flu has risen to 159 with more than 1,300 patients under observation . \nThe number of cases globally is rising though no-one outside Mexico has died . \nGermany has become the latest country to confirm cases of the H1N1 virus , reporting three sufferers . \nCountries with suspected cases : Brazil , Guatemala , Peru , Australia , and South Korea , and seven EU states All three recently returned from Mexico , officials said . \nSpain and the UK earlier confirmed two cases each and six other EU states have been monitoring patients suspected of having the virus . \nAt 64 , the US has the greatest number of confirmed cases outside Mexico . \nThe state of California has declared a state of emergency and President Barack Obama is asking Congress for an additional $ 1.5 bn dollars to bolster the US response . \nA US federal health official , Dr Richard Besser of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said on Tuesday : `` As we continue to investigate cases here , I expect that we will see deaths in this country .

'' \nCNN is withholding his real name for his own safety . \nOn an almost hourly basis , regime officials and government minders tell foreign journalists that Tripoli is a stronghold of Gadhafi and that dissent has vanished in recent months . \nCNN , like other media here , is under severe government restrictions . \nBut I recently managed to slip away from government minders to talk directly to several Libyans . \nAnd according to several eyewitness accounts , major demonstrations were held against Libya 's strongman as recently as last week . \nAnd in the Souq al-Juma neighborhood of the capital , where anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted in February , the government 's propaganda bubble is quickly burst . \nWhile international journalists including me were ferried by government minders to a pro-Gadhafi rally at Green Square on Friday afternoon , multiple sources tell CNN that several Tripoli neighborhoods were wracked by running battles between protesters and security forces . \n`` They were protesting right around the corner . \nThey streamed out of a mosque and onto the small square , '' said Mahmoud . \n`` Almost immediately Gadhafi forces fired at them with live rounds . '' \nMahmoud and other sources say that the group was several hundred strong . \nHe claims that three people were killed and that the area was put under lockdown by government security . \nOther people in the area confirmed the death toll , but it is impossible for CNN to independently verify this account . \nThe government has repeatedly denied any anti-Gadhafi protests in Tripoli in recent weeks , including on Friday . \nA taxi driver in his 20s also said that he took part in one of the protests in Souq al-Juma on Friday . \nCNN is calling him Jamal -- not his real name -- to protect his safety . \n`` We came out after afternoon prayers , '' he said , `` we were unarmed and peaceful and they just shot at us . '' \nHe says he a bullet grazed his arm . \nJamal says that unlike the rebels in the East , they do n't have easy access to weapons to fight . \nBut he says , `` I am not afraid . \nEven though we were unarmed , I am doing this for the future of my country . '' \nAnother protest was fired upon in a seaside neighborhood of the capital , Jamal says , citing friends who said they were at the demonstration . \nSpeaking to journalists in Tripoli is risky . \nGadhafi 's vast spying network means that almost anyone on the street could be an informer or worse . \nResidents of Souq al-Juma say that hundreds , if not thousands , have been summarily arrested by the dreaded intelligence `` brigades .

{"txt": "Asia worries over H1N1 flu vaccine production HONG KONG | Mon May 18 , 2009 1:35 pm IST HONG KONG -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Asia has shown steely resolve in fighting the H1N1 flu virus with health checks and quarantines , but with more than 90 percent of flu vaccine production capacity located in the West , is less prepared than it wants to be . \nVaccines are a key weapon to fight any pandemic influenza virus , but the bulk of production is sited in Europe and the United States and health experts and officials in Asia find that worrying . \n`` Do you actually think that in a really serious pandemic that vaccines will be shipped here -LRB- to Asia -RRB- ? '' \nsaid a microbiologist in Hong Kong , who declined to be identified . \nEven though the new H1N1 appears mild for now , countries like India and Indonesia are keenly aware of their vulnerability and have recently ordered local companies to develop H1N1 vaccines . \nBut Asia lacks sophisticated medical technology , experts say , and while it takes an experienced vaccine maker in the west four to six months to prepare a vaccine , Indonesian drugmaker Bio Farma said last week that it would need two years . \nLily Sulistyowati , an official with Indonesia 's Ministry of Health , said that if the country failed to come up with its own vaccine , it would push the WHO to distribute stocks fairly . \n`` We had the experience with bird flu where we had to line up to buy Tamiflu behind other countries that did n't have any cases . \nWhy should we line up when we have the most cases ? '' \n`` We hope that wo n't happen again , we should be given priority if we have more cases than other countries , '' she told Reuters . \nIndia has invited a number of local drugmakers to submit plans and the government will decide in the coming week which company gets to manufacture the H1N1 vaccine . \nV.M. Katoch of the Indian Council of Medical Research told Reuters : `` We 'll do our best ... We are very confident , whatever we try to do , we do succeed . '' \nIn Geneva on Saturday , health negotiators from rich and poor countries failed to clinch a full deal on virus sharing to produce vaccines , but said they had closed gaps on some tough political issues . \nThe vast majority of H1N1 cases are in Mexico and the United States but the spread of the disease to at least 39 countries led the WHO to declare a pandemic was imminent at the end of April . \nIts pandemic alert level is now 5 on a 6-level scale . \nThe WHO , whose data lags national tallies , earlier put the number of confirmed worldwide cases of the flu strain , a mix of swine , human and avian viruses , at 8,480 , with 72 deaths . \nBen Cowling , public health expert at the University of Hong Kong , said it would be interesting to see whether governments in Asia forge deals with western vaccine makers . \n`` Many western countries have agreements with vaccine makers . \nThat 's why phase 6 alert is a big deal because it means we promise to buy vaccines from you , it gives the vaccine producers the assurance that they need -LRB- to go into production -RRB- , '' he said . \nNearly all of the world 's flu vaccine factories - which produce 350 million doses annually - are in Europe and the United States . \nThey can ramp up production to 500 million doses , but that 's not enough for a global population of over 6 billion . \nChina , Japan , South Korea and Australia produce seasonal flu vaccines but these are mostly for domestic use and their combined share make up less than 10 percent of the world 's total . \n`` We are in touch with vaccine makers and have expressed our interest to buy . \nBut there are no details as they have not started production yet , '' a Hong Kong government spokeswoman said . \nSome countries are relaxed as the virus appears mild so far . \nTawee Chotpitayasunondh , head of Thailand 's unit for strategic planning in fighting pandemic flu , said Thailand was `` thinking about vaccine ' but this was not a priority . \n`` The priority now is how to stop the spread among people to prevent secondary spreading , that is what we are fighting now . '' \nMajor vaccine makers in the west have already obtained the new H1N1 virus samples from the WHO , but the organization has not decided whether manufacturers should shift their production away from seasonal flu vaccines to targetting H1N1 .

{"txt": "On November 8 , the American army launched its biggest ever assault on the Iraqi city of Falluja , considered a stronghold for rebel fighters . \nThe US said the raid had been a huge success , killing 1,200 insurgents . \nBut the city 's residents said they had never seen anything like it in their longtime lives . \nWhat really happened in the siege of Falluja ? \nIn a joint investigation for the Guardian and Channel 4 News , Iraqi doctor Ali Fadhil compiled the first independent reports from the devastated city , where he found scores of unburied corpses , rabid dogs - and a dangerously embittered population Watch an extract from the documentary It all started at my house in Baghdad . \nI packed my equipment , the camera and the tripod . \nTariq , my friend , told me not to take it with us . \n`` The fighters might search the car and think that we are spies . '' \nTariq was frightened about our trip , even though he is from Falluja and we had permission from one group of fighters to enter under their protection . \nBut Tariq , more than anyone , understands that the fighters are no longer just one group . \nHe is quite a character , Tariq : 32 and an engineer with a masters degree in embryo implantation , he works now at a human rights institute called the Democratic Studies Institute for Human Rights and Democracy in Baghdad . \nHe is also deeply into animal rights . \nFoolishly , I took a pill to try to keep down the flu , which made me sleepy . \nIt was 9am when we crossed the main southern gate out of Baghdad , taking care to stay well clear of American convoys . \nThe southern gate is the scene of daily attacks on the Americans by the insurgents - either a car-bomb or an ambush with rocket-propelled grenades . \nIt took just 20 minutes from Baghdad to reach the area known as the `` triangle of death '' , where the kidnapped British contractor Kenneth Bigley was held and finally beheaded in the town of Latifya . \nIt is supposed to be a US military-controlled zone , but insurgents set up checkpoints here . \nAs the road became more rural and more isolated , I got nervous that at any moment we would be stopped by carjackers and robbed of our expensive equipment . \nAt a checkpoint a hooded face came to the window ; he was carrying an old AK47 on his shoulder and looking for a donation towards the jihad . \nThere were six fighters in total , all hooded . \nThe driver and Tariq both made a donation ; I was frightened he would search the car and find the camera , so I gave him my Iraqi doctor 's ID card , hoping that would work . \nHe apologised and asked that we excuse him . \nNow , there was nothing ahead but the sky and the desert . \nIt was 1.30 pm and a bad time to use this road ; we had been told that carjackers were particularly active at this time of day . \nTariq pointed out four young men dressed in red , their two motorbikes parked by the side of the road . \nThey were planting a small , improvised explosive device made out of a tin of cooking oil for the next American convoy to leave the base outside Falluja . \nIt was 3.30 pm before we got to Habbanya , a tourist resort on a lake supplied with fresh water by the Euphrates , which was once controlled by Uday , Saddam 's oldest son . \nIt was here that Fallujans , who used to be wealthy as they supplied a lot of the top military for Saddam 's army , came for holidays . \nNow the place was freezing , and full of refugees . \nAll the holiday houses were crammed with people , sometimes two families to a room . \nThe first family we came across had been there since a month before the attack started . \nA man called Abu Rabe'e came up . \nHe was 59 and used to be a builder ; he said he had a message for our camera . \n`` We 're not looking for this sort of democracy , this attacking of the city and the people with planes and tanks and Humvees . '' \nHe had also fled Falluja with his family . \nThey were all living in a former mechanic 's garage in Habbanya . \nMost of the people we spoke to in Habbanya were poor and uneducated , and had fled Falluja in anticipation of the US attack . \nSome were in tents ; others were sharing the old honeymoon suites where newlyweds used to come when this was a holiday resort . \nThey squabbled among themselves to persuade me to film the conditions they were living in . \nThere was still a fairground in Habbanya , but nothing was working . \nIn the middle of the bumper cars an old lady had pitched a tent with bricks , where she was living with her son . \nI tried to talk to her but she told me to go away . \nThere was no cooking gas in Habbanya , so the Fallujan refugees were cutting down trees to keep warm and cook food . \nThen someone came up and said the resistance fighters had heard we were asking questions . \nWe decided to put the camera away and go to a friendly village that our driver knew . \nIt was also filled with refugees from Falluja . \nOne 50-year-old man , a major in the Iraqi Republican Guards under the former regime , took us in . \nThere were four families squeezed into one apartment , all of them once wealthy . \nThe major , like the others , was sacked after the liberation when the US disbanded the army and police . \nNow jobless , his house in Falluja was wrecked and he was a refugee with his five children and wife near the town where he used to spend his holidays . \nHe was angry with the Americans , but also with the Iraqi rebels , whom he blamed , alongside the clerics in the mosques , for causing Falluja to be wrecked . \n`` The mujahideen and the clerics are responsible for the destruction that happened to our city ; no one will forgive them for that , '' he said with bitterness . \n`` Why are you blaming them - why do n't you blame the Americans and Allawi ? '' \nsaid Omar , the owner of the apartment . \n`` We told the mujahideen to leave it to us ordinary Fallujans , but those bloody bastards , the sheikhs and the clerics , are busy painting some bloody mad picture of heaven and martyrs and the victory of the mujahideen , '' said Ali , another refugee . \n`` And , of course , the kids believe every word those clerics say . \nThey 're young and naive , and they forget that this is a war against the might of the machine of the American army . \nSo they let those kids die like this and our city gets blown up with the wind . '' \nI wanted to ask the tough old Republican guard why they had let these young muj have the run of the city , but I actually did n't have to . \nI remember being in Falluja just before the fighting started and seeing a crowd gathered around a sack that was leaking blood . \nA piece of white A4 paper was stuck on to the sack , which read : `` Here is the body of the traitor . \nHe has confessed to acting as a spotter for American planes and was paid $ 100 a day . '' \nAt the same time as we were standing looking at the sack , I knew I would be able to buy a CD of the man in this sack making his confession before he was beheaded in any CD shop in Falluja . \nThese were the people who controlled Falluja now - not old majors from Saddam 's army . \nIn the morning we went back towards Falluja and heard that there were queues of people waiting to try to get back into the city . \nThe government had made an announcement saying that the people from some districts could start to go back home ; they promised compensation . \nAbout midday we got a mile east of the city and saw that four queues had formed near the American base . \nThey were mostly men , waiting for US military ID to allow them back home . \nThe men were angry : `` This is a humiliation . \nI say no more than that . \nThese IDs are to make us bow Fallujan heads in shame , '' one of them said . \nI met Major Paul Hackett , a marine officer in the Falluja liaison base . \nHe said that the US military was not trying to humiliate anyone , but that the IDs were necessary for security . \n`` I mean , my understanding is that ultimately they can hang this ID card on a wall and keep it as a souvenir , '' he said . \nThey took prints of all my fingers , two pictures of my face in profile , and then photographed my iris . \nI was now eligible to go into Falluja , just like any other Fallujan . \nBut it was late by then , somewhere near 5pm -LRB- the curfew is at 6pm -RRB- . \nAfter that anyone who moves inside the city will be shot on sight by the US military . \nTomorrow , we would try again to get into the city . \nAt around 8am , Tariq and I drove towards Falluja . \nWe did n't believe that we might actually get into the city . \nThe American soldiers at the checkpoint were nervous . \nThe approach to the checkpoint was covered in pebbles so we had to drive very slowly . \nThe soldiers spent 20 minutes searching my car , then they bodysearched Tariq and me . \nThey gave me a yellow tape to put on to the windscreen of the car , showing I had been searched and was a contractor . \nIf I did n't have this stripe of yellow , a US sniper would shoot me as an enemy car . \nBy 10am we were inside the city . \nIt was completely devastated , destruction everywhere . \nIt looked like a city of ghosts . \nFalluja used to be a modern city ; now there was nothing . \nWe spent the day going through the rubble that had been the center of the city ; I did n't see a single building that was functioning . \nThe Americans had put a white tape across the roads to stop people wandering into areas that they still were n't allowed to enter . \nI remembered the market from before the war , when you could n't walk through it because of the crowds . \nNow all the shops were marked with a cross , meaning that they had been searched and secured by the US military . \nBut the bodies , some of them civilians and some of them insurgents , were still rotting inside . \nThere were dead dogs everywhere in this area , lying in the middle of the streets . \nReports of rabies in Falluja had reached Baghdad , but I needed to find a doctor . \nFallujans are suspicious of outsiders , so I found it surprising when Nihida Kadhim , a housewife , beckoned me into her home . \nShe had just arrived back in the city to check out her house ; the government had told the people three days earlier that they should start going home . \nShe called me into her living room . \nOn her mirror she pointed to a message that had been written in her lipstick . \nShe could n't read English . \nIt said : `` Fuck Iraq and every Iraqi in it ! '' \n`` They are insulting me , are n't they ? '' \nI left her and walked towards the cemetery . \nI noticed the dead dogs again . \nI had been told in Baghdad by a friend of mine , Dr Marwan Elawi , that the Baghdad Hospital for Infectious Diseases admits one case of rabies every week . \nThe problem is that infected dogs are eating the corpses and spreading the disease . \nAs I was walking by the cemetery , I caught the smell of death coming from one of the houses . \nThe door was open and the first thing I saw was a white car parked in the driveway and on top of it a launcher for an RPG . \nI went inside , and the sound of the rain on the roof and the darkness inside made me very afraid . \nThe door was open , all the windows were broken and there were bullet holes running down the hall to a bathroom at the end - as if the bullets were chasing something or somebody . \nThe bathroom led on to a bedroom and I stepped inside and saw the body of a fighter . \nThe leg was missing , the hand was missing and the furniture in the house had been destroyed . \nI could n't breathe with the smell . \nI realized that Tariq was n't with me , and I panicked and ran . \nAs I got out of the house I saw a white teddy bear lying in the rain , and a green boobytrap bomb . \nSome of the worst fighting took place here in the center of the city , but there was no sign of the 1,200 to 1,600 fighters the Americans said they had killed . \nI had heard that there was a graveyard for the fighters somewhere in the city but people said that most of them had withdrawn from the city after the first week of fighting . \nI needed to find one of the insurgents to tell me the real story of what had happened in the city . \nThe Americans had said that there had been a big military victory , but I could n't understand where all the fighters were buried . \nAfter I saw the body I felt uncomfortable about sleeping in Falluja . \nThe place was deserted and polluted with death and all kinds of weapons . \nImagine sleeping in a place where any of the surrounding houses might have one , two or three bodies . \nWe went back to my friend the old Republican guard officer . \nI was so tired I could hardly take my clothes off to go to sleep but I could n't sleep with the smell of death on my clothes . \nIn the morning , I went back to find the cemetery and look for evidence of the fighters who had been killed . \nIt was about 4pm before I got inside the martyrs ' cemetery ; people kept waylaying me , wanting to show me their destroyed houses and asking why the journalists did n't come and show what the Americans had done to Falluja . \nThey were also angry at the interim President Allawi for sending in the mainly Shia National Guard to help the Americans . \nAt the entrance to the fighters ' graveyard a sign read : `` This cemetery is being given by the people of Falluja to the heroic martyrs of the battle against the Americans and to the martyrs of the jihadi operations against the Americans , assigned and approved by the Mujahideen Shura council in Falluja . '' \nAs I went into the graveyard , the bodies of two young men were arriving . \nThe faces were rotting . \nThe ambulance driver lifted the bones of one of the hands ; the skin had rotted away . \n`` God is the greatest . \nWhat kind of times are we living through that we are holding the bones and hands of our brothers ? '' \nThen he began cursing the National Guard , calling them even worse things than the Americans : `` Those bastards , those sons of dogs . '' \nIt was n't the first time I had heard this . \nIt was the National Guard the Americans used to search the houses ; they were seen by the Fallujans as brutal stooges . \nMost of the volunteers for the National Guard are poor Shias from the south . \nThey are jobless and desperate enough to volunteer for a job that makes them assassination targets . \n`` National infidels '' , they were also called . \nI counted the graves : there were 74 . \nThe two young men made it 76 . \nThe names on the headstones were written in chalk and some had been washed away . \nOne read : `` Here lies the heroic Tunisian martyr who died '' , but I did n't see any other evidence of the hundreds of foreign fighters that the US had said were using Falluja as their headquarters . \nPeople told me there were some Yemenis and Saudis , some volunteers from Tunisia and Egypt , but most of the fighters were Fallujan . \nThe US military say they have hundreds of bodies frozen in a potato chip factory 5km south of the city , but nobody has been allowed to go there in the past two months , including the Red Crescent . \nSalman Hashim was crying beside the grave of his son , who had been a fighter in Falluja . \n`` He is 18 years old . \nHe wanted to be a doctor or engineer after this year ; it was his last year in high school . '' \nAt the same grave , the boy 's mother was crying and remembering her dead son , who was called Ahmed . \n`` I blame Ayad Allawi . \nIf I could I would cut his throat into pieces . '' \nThen , to the mound of earth covering her son 's body , she said : `` I told you those fighters would get you killed . '' \nThe boy 's father told her to be quiet in front of the camera . \nOn the next grave was written the name of a woman called Harbyah . \nShe had refused to leave the city for the camps with her family . \nOne of her relatives was standing by her grave . \nHe said that he found her dead in her bed with at least 20 bullets in her body . \nI saw other rotting bodies that showed no signs of being fighters . \nIn one house in the market there were four bodies inside the guest room . \nOne of the bodies had its chest and part of its stomach opened , as if the dogs had been eating it . \nThe wrists were missing , the flesh of the arm was missing , and parts of the legs . \nI tried to figure out who these four men were . \nIt was obvious which houses the fighters were in : they were totally destroyed . \nBut in this house there were no bullets in the walls , just four dead men lying curled up beside each other , with bullet holes in the mosquito nets that covered the windows . \nIt seemed to me as if they had been asleep and were shot through the windows . \nIt is the young men of the family who are usually given the job of staying behind to guard the house . \nThis is the way in Iraq - we never leave the house empty . \nThe four men were sleeping the way we sleep when we have guests - we roll out the best carpet in the guest room and the men lie down beside each other . \n`` Its Abu Faris 's house . \nI think that the fat dead body belongs to his son , Faris , '' said Abu Salah , whose chip shop was also destroyed in the bombing . \nIt was getting dark and it was time to go , but I needed some overview shots of the city . \nThere was a half-built tower , so I climbed it and looked around . \nI could n't see a single building that had n't been hit . \nAfter a few minutes I got the sense that this was n't a good place for me to be hanging around , but I had to pee urgently . \nI found a place on the roof of the building . \nWhile I was doing that a warning shot passed so close to my head that I ducked and did n't even wait to pull up my zip , but ran to the half-destroyed stairs to climb down the building . \nI felt as if the American sniper was playing with me ; he had had plenty of time to kill me if he wanted to . \nFor the rest of the day people were pulling on me to come and see their houses . \nAgain , they asked where all the journalists were . \nWhy were they not coming to report on what has happened in Falluja ? \nBut I have worked with journalists for 18 months and I knew it would be too dangerous for them to come to the city , that they are seen as spies and could end up in a sack . \nSo since I was the only one there with a camera , everyone wanted to show me what happened to their house . \nBack in Baghdad that night , I changed my clothes and decided to send them to the public laundry . \nI was worried about contaminating my family with Falluja . \nI was thinking that nobody was going to be able to live there for months . \nThen , I took a very long bath . \nI woke up at home in Baghdad around 9am . \nI had had enough of Falluja , but I still felt that I did n't understand what had happened . \nThe city was completely devastated - but where were the bodies of all the dead fighters the Americans had killed ? \nI wanted to ask Dr Adnan Chaichan about the wounded . \nI found him at the main hospital in Falluja at midday . \nHe told me that all the doctors and medical staff were locked into the hospital at the beginning of the attack and not allowed out to treat anyone . \nThe Iraqi National Guard , acting under US orders , had tied him and all the other doctors up inside the main hospital . \nThe US had surrounded the hospital , while the National Guard had seized all their mobile phones and satellite phones , and left them with no way of communicating with the outside world . \nChaichan seemed angrier with the National Guards than with anyone else . \nHe said that the phone lines inside the town were working , so wounded people in Falluja were calling the hospital and crying , and he was trying to give instructions over the phone to the local clinics and the mosques on how to treat the wounds . \nBut nobody could get to the main hospital where all the supplies were and people were bleeding to death in the city . \nIt was late afternoon when I drove out of Falluja and back to Baghdad , feeling that I had just scratched the surface of what really happened there . \nBut it is clear that by completely destroying this Sunni city , with the help of a mostly Shia National Guard , the US military has fanned the seeds of a civil war that is definitely coming . \nIf there are elections now and the Shia win , that war is certain . \nThe people I spoke to had no plans to vote . \nNo one I met in those five days had a ballot paper . \nA week after I arrived in London to make the film for Channel 4 News , the tape of the final interview arrived by Federal Express . \nIt was the interview with Alzaim Abu , who had led the fighters in the Shuhada district of Falluja and fought the Americans in the early battles in the city center . \nWe had been been trying to track him down for nearly three weeks . \nThen Tariq had got a call from him the night I had left for London saying that he would talk . \nThere was a lot of bullshit in the interview ; lots of bravado about how many Americans they had killed and about never surrendering and how Fallujans would win . \nHe said that there were a few foreign fighters in the city , but none in his units ; mostly , they were Fallujans . \nBut one thing stood out for me that explained the empty graveyard and the lack of bodies . \nHe said that most of the fighters had been given orders to abandon the city by November 17 , nine days after the assault began . \n`` The withdrawal of the fighters was carried out following an order by our senior leadership . \nWe did not pull out because we did not want to fight . \nWe needed to regroup ; it was a tactical move . \nThe fighters decided to redeploy to Amiriya and some went to Abu Ghraib , '' he said . \nThe US military destroyed Falluja , but simply spread the fighters out around the country . \nThey also increased the chance of civil war in Iraq by using their new national guard of Shias to suppress Sunnis . \nOnce , when a foreign journalist , an Irish guy , asked me whether I was Shia or Sunni - the way the Irish do because they have that thing about the IRA - I said I was Sushi . \nMy father is Sunni and my mother is Shia . \nI never cared about these things . \nNow , after Falluja , it matters .

{"txt": "By Tarek Osman , Special to CNN Egypt protests represent significant challenge to Mubarak regime , Tarek Osman writes The author says protests expose the divisions in economy and society Osman says rise of middle class means many have a stake in avoiding chaos He says the regime 's opponents are divided and not prepared to lead Editor 's note : Tarek Osman is an Egyptian writer . \nHe is the author of `` Egypt on the Brink : From Nasser to Mubarak '' -LRB- Yale University Press , 2011 -RRB- . \nCairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This week tens of thousands swamped the heart of Cairo , Alexandria , and other major Egyptian cities , facing down anti-riot police , to demand cheaper food , better services , and substantial changes to the regime 's modus operandi . \nWith five dead , more than 100 injured , and the police resorting to tear gas to disperse the demonstrators , most observers are examining whether the Egyptian regime will be able to contain the situation and suppress the protests without even more significant bloodshed . \nTwo factors suggest continued tension and further challenges to the regime . \nFirst , the Egyptian state 's institutional framework is at its weakest point since the coup\\/revolution of 1952 that created the Egyptian republic . \nThe delicate balance that the regime has nurtured , between the rise of the liberal capitalists within the ruling National Democratic Party -LRB- NDP -RRB- and the traditional power and influence of the military and security establishment , seems to be under strain . \nThe center of gravity and decision-making has shifted from the long-established anchors of stability toward inexperienced new economic and financial players . \nEgypt cracks down on protesters Suez crowds confront riot police Tear gas in the air in Alexandria The ascent of the new capitalists gave rise to the second factor : an unexpected solidarity between the politically active -- who see the influence of the new capitalists as a blurring of the lines between power and wealth -- and the disenfranchised poor , who as a result of successive financial reform measures , face severe economic pains . \nThe situation is made more acute by a youth unemployment rate of more than 15 % -LRB- in an 80 million population , 40 % of whom are under 30 years old -RRB- . \nThe politically active and the millions of poor Egyptians blame the Hosni Mubarak regime , which has been in power for three decades . \nThis is a tenuous political environment , where anguish and anxiety can quickly turn into anger , and with any catalyst , into action . \nBut , so far , the situation in Egypt is not combustible . \nDespite the regime 's overall poor record , its major upgrading of the country 's infrastructure , relative success in installing economic liberalization , and cautious foreign policy have fostered an environment in which a few million middle class families managed to secure economic gains . \nThe past decade also witnessed a notable rise in entrepreneurialism with hundreds of thousands of Egyptians able to build small enterprises leveraging the growth in economic sectors ranging from food and beverages , to tourism , to information technology , to entertainment . \nThe development of the Egyptian real estate industry and the country 's capital markets attracted the life savings of few more millions . \nIn today 's Egypt , specifically in Cairo , Alexandria , and the major cities of the Nile Delta , there is a relatively large middle class that has a serious stake in the country 's economic future , realistic ambitions for further economic gains , and which abhors the prospect of chaos in the country . \nAnother factor reduces the chances of immediate change in Egypt : the unpreparedness of the regime 's serious political opponents . \nThe street 's demonstrations create momentum and could be a catalyst for change . \nBut the regime 's rivals vying for power in Egypt remain deeply wanting . \nThis is a tenuous political environment , where anguish and anxiety can quickly turn into anger ... The liberal movement continues to be fragmented , from the traditional opposition parties , to students ' movements , to the upper-middle-class intelligentsia , to the new National Association of Change , the vehicle associated with Dr. Mohamed El-Baradei . \nArguably , the liberal movement benefits from the nationalist , inclusive slogans of the demonstrations which shunned appeals to Islam and Christianity in favor of Egyptianism . \nBut the liberal movement so far lacks the institutional structure required to evolve into a viable , immediate alternative to the regime . \nThis unpreparedness is a paramount deficiency in a country with colossal economic challenges such as Egypt 's . \nAs Egypt heads toward a presidential election in September , two things will shape its political landscape . \nOne is the interaction amongst the regime , political Islam , and the liberal movement ; the other is the relationship within the regime itself -- between the military and security establishment on the one hand and Egypt 's economic power centers on the other . \nIt is unlikely that the situation in Egypt will descend into chaos . \nThe military and security establishment can enforce stability , provided we do not see major unrest within the country 's middle class . \nBut these expressions of anger intensify the uncertainty surrounding Egypt 's future -- especially in the period post-Mubarak , who is approaching his mid-80s . \nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tarek Osman .

{"txt": "cents US suspends drilling in Arctic Ocean following Gulf disaster cents ` Top kill ' plan 's chance of success put at 50-70 % cents Untried deep underwater tactic uses heavy mud to stem leak Thursday 27 May 2010 18.05 BST This image made from video released by BP shows equipment being used to try to plug the gushing oil well in a maneouvre known as a `` top kill '' , which is untried at 5,000 ft underwater . \nPhotograph : Associated Press The Gulf oil spill has surpassed the Exxon Valdez as the worst in US history , according to new estimates released today , although the coastguard and BP said an untested procedure to plug the leak appeared to be working . \nA team of scientists , trying to find out how much oil has been flowing since the offshore rig Deepwater Horizon exploded on 20 April , found the rate was more than twice and possibly up to five times as high as previously thought . \nEven using the most conservative estimate , that means the leak has grown to nearly 72 million liters , surpassing the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , which at about 42 million litres had been the nation 's worst spill . \nUnder the highest estimate , nearly 148 million litres may have spilled . \nMeanwhile BP engineers hare well advanced on the risky procedure known as a `` top kill '' to try to cut off the flow by pumping heavy drilling fluid into the well . \nIf that works , BP will inject cement into the well to seal it . \nThe top kill has been used above ground but has never been tried in deep water . \nThe top kill started Wednesday night and it could be several days before officials know if it is working . \n`` The top kill was working , but said the chances of success were 50-70 % , '' Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , told reporters . \nLieutenant commander Tony Russell , an aide to Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , said Thursday that the mud was stopping some oil and gas but had a ways to go before it proved successful . \nThe top kill started Wednesday night and it could be several days before officials know if it is working . \n`` As you inject your mud into it , it is going to stop some hydrocarbons , '' Russell said . \n`` That does n't mean it 's successful . '' \nBP spokesman Tom Mueller also discounted news reports that the top kill had worked . \n`` We appreciate the optimism , but the top kill operation is continuing through the day today that has n't changed , '' he said . \n`` We do n't anticipate being able to say anything definitive on that until later today . '' \nOil is coating birds and delicate wetlands along the Louisiana coast , and the political fallout from the spill has reached Washington , where the head of the federal agency that oversees offshore drilling resigned today . \nElizabeth Birnbaum , the director of the minerals management service , stepped down hours before a planned White House press conference where President Barack Obama was expected to extend a moratorium on new deepwater oil drilling . \nBirnbaum and her agency came under withering criticism from lawmakers of both parties over lax oversight of drilling and cozy ties with industry . \nAn internal Interior Department report released earlier this week found that between 2000 and 2008 , agency staff members accepted tickets to sports events , lunches and other gifts from oil and gas companies and used government computers to view pornography . \nBirnbaum had run the service since July 2009 . \nAfter receiving the results of a 30-day safety review from the interior secretary Ken Salazar , Obama also planned to delay controversial lease sales off the coast of Alaska and cancel plans for drilling lease sales in the Western Gulf and off the coast of Virginia , according to a White House aide . \nIf the top kill fails , BP says it has several backup plans , including sealing the well 's blowout preventer with a smaller cap , which would contain the oil . \nAn earlier attempt to cap the blowout preventer failed . \nBP could also try a `` junk shot '' shooting golf balls and other debris into the blowout preventer to clog it up during the top kill process . \nThe only permanent solution is drilling a second well , but that will take a couple of months . \nBP plans to go ahead with that even if the top kill works . \nSpeaking six hours into the operation , BP 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , said it appeared to be working and that mud , not oil , was now coming out of the ruptured pipe . \n`` We 're doing everything we can to bring it to closure , and actually we 're executing this ` top kill ' job as efficiently and effectively as we can , '' he said . \nThe company has 50,000 barrels of mud on location , which it described as `` far more than necessary , but we want to be prepared for anything '' . \nLast night , Barack Obama described the disaster as `` heartbreaking '' and expressed hope that the procedure will work . \n`` If it 's successful , and there 's no guarantee , it should greatly reduce or eliminate the flow of oil now streaming into the Gulf from the sea floor , '' the president said . \nObama added : `` We will not rest until this well is shut , the environment is repaired and the clean-up is complete . '' \nHis statement followed a poll by CBS News yesterday which found 70 % disapproval of BP 's handling , and 45 % unhappy with the Obama administration 's response . \nYesterday , Salazar reiterated that BP will be `` held accountable '' for compensation and government costs . \nThe oil company may find itself having to answer further questions today , after revelations that just days before the Deepwater Horizon explosion the company had chosen to use the riskier of two types of casing for the leaking well . \nThe New York Times reported the existence of a BP document , given to the paper by a Congressional investigator , which noted the casing that the company had chosen was described in the document as the `` best economic case '' , despite BP admitting it carried risks beyond the potential gas leaks . \nGreg McCormack , director of the Petroleum Extension Service at the University of Texas at Austin , told the newspaper that BP 's decision was `` without a doubt a riskier way to go '' , an assessment which the New York Times reported several other engineers had agreed with . \nA BP spokesman argued that the Deepwater Horizon approach had not been unusual . \nHayward yesterday visited the scene of the environmental disaster in Port Fourchon in southern Louisiana , where he said he was `` absolutely gutted '' that the crude oil had started to wash ashore . \n`` As I said , it 's clear that the defense of the shoreline , at this point , has not been successful , '' Hayward said . \n`` I feel devastated by that , absolutely gutted . \nWhat I can tell you is that we are here for the long haul . \nWe are going to clean every drop of oil off the shore . \nJust days after a top US official suggested that BP faced an `` existential crisis '' , Hayward conceded : `` I think this is clearly a major reputational issue for BP .

{"txt": "June 26 : President Obama and British Prime Minister Cameron talk at the conclusion of the G20 conference in Ontario , Canada . \nAFP In an effort to defuse what will likely be the biggest point of contention in their Tuesday White House meeting , British Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to tell President Obama that the release of convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdel Baset al-Megrahi was `` wrong . '' \nIn their first White House meeting , the two leaders are also expected to discuss Afghanistan , BP 's handling of the oil spill in the Gulf and its alleged role in the release of al-Megrahi . \nIn an interview with BBC news , Cameron , who was elected prime minister in May , said he `` deeply regrets '' the pain the decision caused , but asserted that the release of al-Megrahi in August of last year was the decision of the Scottish government alone . \n`` All I know is , as leader of the opposition , I could not have been more clear that I thought the decision to release al-Megrahi was completely and utterly wrong , '' be told the BBC . \nCameron said on the topic , '' I have no idea what BP did . \n`` There was no discussion with the UK government about the release of al-Megrahi , '' said Carl-Henric Svanberg . \nAl-Megrahi , who suffered from prostate cancer , was released in August 2009 by Scottish officials on `` compassionate grounds '' after he was given only 3 three-months to live . \nAl-Megrahi received a hero 's welcome when he returned to his native Libya -- where he is still living -- almost one year later . \nJust as British-owned BP sealed the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , the company came under fire again , but this time for allegations that BP , which has lucrative oil contracts in Libya , lobbied the British government in 2007 to proceed with a UK-Libya prisoner transfer agreement . \nBP has acknowledged it warned the Labor government of a possible `` negative impact on UK commercial interests , '' but denies there were any discussions with either the UK or Scottish government about al-Megrahi . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said Saturday there was no evidence BP had any connection with al-Megrahi 's release , but there is little doubt Prime Minister Cameron , who travels to Capitol Hill for meetings with House and Senate leadership Tuesday , will be peppered with BP questions . \nJust last week New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer called on the company to suspend oil drilling plans in Libya until the company 's role in the release of al-Megrahi is investigated . \n`` The bottom line is simple : If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , then it just might be a corrupt deal between BP , the British government and Libya , '' said Schumer , who lost numerous constituents in the December 21 , 1988 , bombing , `` Back in 2007 , BP and the Libyan government struck a $ 900 million oil deal that the prime minister , Tony Blair , helped coordinate , '' said Schumer in a news conference with reporters . \n`` But the deal ran into roadblocks , and BP admits that it pushed the British government to expedite a prisoner exchange agreement with Libya to smooth the way for an oil deal . \nWe then know that the British government agreed to release al - Megrahi based on a fraudulent doctor 's prognosis that he only had three months to live . \nAll of a sudden , once Megrahi is released , all the roadblocks to that oil deal are removed and , lo and behold , the oil deal is finally approved . \nIf anyone thinks this is a coincidence , I have them a bridge to sell them in Brooklyn , '' the senior senator from New York charged . \nIn his interview with BBC , Cameron said on the topic , `` I have no idea what BP did . \nI am not responsible for BP . '' \nBut BP and the oil spill the in the gulf have strained relations between the U.S. and U.K. since the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion on April 20th . \nAnd as British prime minister , Cameron has had to lead the defense of the British-owned company amid harsh criticism from the American government and its citizens affected by the spill . \nJune was an especially tough month for relations . \nAs tens of thousands of barrels of oil continued to spill into the Gulf , President Obama , who early on in the environmental disaster referred to the company as `` British Petroleum , '' said he would have fired BP CEO Tony Hayward . \nThe president also embraced the idea that the oil company suspend its quarterly dividend and criticized BP for spending money on a PR campaign . \nThe angry words from Washington produced a backlash in the U.K. , where millions of British retirees depend on BP , the world 's third-largest oil company , for their pensions . \nAnd Cameron had promised to press Obama during their one-on-one first meeting during the G8\\/G20 in Toronto , for a dollar amount so BP would have an idea of the final costs related to the oil spill . \nNo such request was made , at least publicly . \nRelations between the two countries seem to have simmered since Hayward was pulled from handling the oil spill 's day-to-day operations and President Obama sat down with BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg . \nThe administration 's meeting with BP executives in June led to the company 's announcement of a $ 20 billion escrow fund over 4 years , to pay claims to Gulf Coast residents and business owners affected by the spill . \nFollowing the four hour meeting with senior administration officials , the chairman also announced the suspension of dividend payments to shareholders and the creation of a $ 100 million fund to assist out of work oil workers following the government 's six month moratorium on deepwater drilling . \nTuesday 's Oval Office meeting will be the second time the two world leaders are meeting , and the first time in the U.S. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said of all topics to be discussed , Afghanistan topped the U.S. 's list of priorities . \nThere are now approximately 10,000 British troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO led effort and the British have seen an increase in causalities as of late . \nThe U.K. hopes to have withdrawn all its forces by 2015 . \nAsked if Obama would try to dissuade Cameron from naming a target date , Gibbs said , `` it is hard to look that far into the future . \nObviously , the president has committed to July of 2011 as a date of our transition and begin to , based on -- judging that based on the conditions on the ground to begin removing some of the troops that -- that the president added as a part of our increased resources there over the past couple years . '' \nFollowing their Oval Office sit down , Obama and Cameron will participate in an East Room joint press conference . \nThe events speak to the often described `` special relationship '' between the U.S. and U.K. , but its a welcome Prime Minister Cameron 's predecessor did not receive . \nPresident Obama welcomed British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to the White House just six weeks after being sworn in himself , but the meeting between the president and the prime minister of one of the U.S. 's biggest allies was lackluster . \nMany Brits considered it a snub that Brown was only received for an Oval Office sit down meeting -- no joint press conference in the East Room or Rose Garden as his predecessor Tony Blair frequently participated in during his tenure with former President George W. Bush . \nOf course , Blair 's relationship with Bush was questioned back at home with many charging Bush treated Blair as a `` lap dog . '' \nAccording to Heather Conley of Center for Strategic and International Studies , a think tank in Washington , in forging his relationship with this U.S. president , Cameron needs to strike a balance between the perceived `` subordinate , ` poodle ' relationship '' he had with Bush , and Gordon Brown 's `` dour , technocratic approach . '' \n`` It remains to be seen if the two leaders will develop that ` special ' chemistry that has been historically evident between American and British leaders but appears to be somewhat elusive between President Obama and other world leaders , '' said Conley . \nConley added that Cameron should be given credit , after only two months on the job , for making some `` gutsy political calls '' like publicly apologizing for British actions related to the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Northern Ireland ; announcing a significant reduction in government spending as well as increasing taxes to reduce the U.K. 's budget deficit ; announcing that British forces will leave Afghanistan no later than 2015 ; and last , but certainly not least , politically navigating the fallout over the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAs part of his schedule while in the states , according to the British embassy , the prime minister will have breakfast with Vice President Joe Biden , travel to Capitol Hill for meetings with House and Senate leaderships , as well as have a sit down with Arizona Republican Senator John McCain . \nAlso on Tuesday , Cameron will have his first sit-down interview with a U.S. television outlet since becoming prime minister -- with ABC 's Diane Sawyer . \nOn Wednesday , the Prime Minister will travel to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier before proceeding to the Pentagon for military briefings on Afghanistan . \nHe will then travel to New York for meetings with U.S. business leaders , and with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon . \nHe also will have dinner with the Mayor of New York , Michael Bloomberg .

neatly take care of ` general welfare ' in a very fair form , but you are still going up against something Solomon couldn t solve . \nFareed Zakaria is perfectly correct mentioning consumers ' living on debt excessively , but perhaps he should point out more explicitely the fact that excessive risk appetite on the part of financial institutions is another important factor that lead to the current mess . \nSome financial institutions literally seemed to fall in love with very risky and very opaque products with no general and transparent valuation methodology available and where they believed they would always outsmart the odds and make a profit accordingly -LRB- like , for example re-securitisations where the investor can not have any reliable idea as to the quality of the underlying debt -RRB- . \nI remember feeling concerned when the voices of the lobbyists intent on loosening some of the financial market regulation originating from the FDR era were heard about 10 years ago , offering no really serious and tangible argumentation and wielding phrases about globalisation and financial innovation instead , and the current development seems to have acknowledged my concerns . \nI believe that what has happened justifies adopting tighter regulation in the financial market aimed at keeping risks within reasonable limits , even if this were at the price of lowering the potential for huge profits . \nI am a foreigner living outside the US who is interested in the issues concerning the current financial crisis . \nForgive please my possible English language mistakes . \nWe are a nation of assemblers . \nParts are made overseas and then imported back here to the U.S. and we merely assemble finished products . \nWhile I would like to believe that my Dell Computer was actually manufacturerd in Texas a quick perusal of its contents indicated that most of the parts were made overseas , mostly China and Taiwan . \nDo n't be fooled by how we have legislated `` manufacturing '' now . \nMy old Ford Taurus had many parts made in Canada and Mexico . \nManufacturing means taking raw material and creating value added processes that make that cheap material into something of worth . \nYou take the iron ore and make it into engine , here in the U.S. . \nWe start making TV sets , monitors , computers from parts made here , not from parts made in China . \nWe are NOT a manufacturing country anymore , we are a service sector economy that assembles stuff from parts made elsewhere . \nThat is why we have a trade deficit . \nThe US has been acting like a spoiled rich kid blowing his parent 's inheritance . \nSo many people thought that they were entitled to everything without having to work for it . \nIf not , we 're on our way to second-class status in the world . \nHigh pay low skill union jobs have been sent overseas . \nUnfortunately , we have n't done enough on the job training for these workers so they could take higher skill jobs till it 's too late . \nWhat we must do is to revive our education if we want to stay competitive in the hi-tech world . \nInstead of using money for roads and bridges all over the country , we probably should send more students to learn math , science and engineering for free . \nBut money ca n't buy everything . \nWithout a sufficient math background , you ca n't learn advanced physics or engineering . \nWe should raise standards in our K-12 math education . \nThe problem we hit firsthand is this out of control math-phobia in this country . \nTake the calculator away . \nMany students ca n't think or feel numbers . \nI think we should start using the metric system soon . \nIt makes math easier when you count with ten fingers rather than 12 or 16 . \nMost importantly , we should hire math teachers trained in math , not education or whatever . \nSadly , this all costs much less than 700 billions . \nThe United States manufactures more now than it ever has . \nManufacturing has increased almost every year -LRB- except a few dips in recessions -RRB- for the past 150 years . \nWhat has changed is the number of people employed in manufacturing . \nWe have automated to stay competitive , and those industries that could not automate have moved to lower wage countries . \nBut we still produce more than ever before . \nDo n't kid yourself that manufacturing went away and might come back . \nWhat has gone forever are high-wage , low-skill union jobs . \nThat they were ever highly paid is an anomaly stemming from the post-WWII world economy , where the USA had nearly the only intact industrial economy -LRB- + Canada and Sweden , who have similar problems -RRB- . \nIn the 1990s , the USA lost 10 % of its manufacturing jobs . \nBrazil lost 20 % . \nChina lost 30 % . \nDo n't kid yourself . \nManufacturing has thrived in the USA . \nOnly the low-skill jobs are gone . \nThey are gone everywhere , forever . \nThe only low skill jobs today are in the service sector . \nNothing a politician can do will change that . \nPart of our economic woes began in the 80s when we moved away from being a manufacturing country and became a service sector society -- basically we are nation of burger flippers . \nProblem is that we created jobs , but these were all minimum wage jobs and eventually with rising house debt , the burger flippers could n't afford to buy the burgers they were flipping . \nThe day comes when the burger joint has to close because no one can afford to buy the goods . \nAnother blogger here does raise an interesting point . \nIf we are indeed not manufacturing much than of course we really do not need much investment in roads and infrastructure . \nClearly , over the past 20 years this is the tact we have collectively chosen . \nThe recent collapse of the bridge in Minneapolis certainly makes that vivid point . \nSince we have become only a nation of assemblers and not creators , we do need some infrastructure but not the heavy duty kind . \nWe have let our education of future science and technology graduates go down the drain , but assemblers do n't really need scientists and engineers , after all the parts are quality assured in Asia . \nAn hey , we have consumers out there that tolerate crap because it is cheap . \nRethinking economic theory in total might be a better idea . \nThe death of reaganomics and the free market voodoo worship . \nAs well as the thorough destruction of government . \nWith the 80 's began the vulture capitalists feeding on the sound American companies with assets to spare and communities sustained by them . \nSo , yes the clever financial management game began aided , I believe , by the clever Wall Street experts brokering the deals and the junk bond financing and S&L defaults . \nWhining constantly about taxes , government programs , intrusive environmental restrictions , workplace safety , financial and food safety regulation and welfare cadillacs glutting our nations highways , and on and on and on . \nSo now we can have taxes to pay for bailouts , deteriorating infrastructure , hurricane disasters festering , vast armies of injuried and traumatized veterans , and the sooner the better . \nLets invest in something of value to our national security and provide jobs . \nAnd how about all that pharma research going to research not company profits and perks , CEO gold , advertising , lawyers etc and have gov ' t agencies and non-profits do it to profit the people of this country for a change . \nLet 's take the profit motive , which we can now clearly see is morally bankrupt , out of health care , drugs , war services , international affairs and diplomacy . \nWhy not hurricane proof our coastal infrastructure , and blizzard proof , and fire proof our country too . \nWhy not get more of the carcinogens out of our health care costs . \nLets invest in education and jobs and community organizers to rebuild some ghettos and serve up jobs rather than prison sentences . \nWhy not establish international coordinated disaster response teams , supplies , etc rather than scrambling at the last minute ? \nWhy not realize we live in an interdependent world economically and in all other ways and plan and act for some mutual benefit and understanding rather than worship this individualism that no longer has a place and is harming our world . \nBridges and roads are infrastructure and important for economic developments . \nHowever , if we are not going to revive manufacturing , the use of bridges and roads wo n't be as productive as before . \nThe question is , `` Can we revive manufacturing in the US ? '' \nWe must be selective in what we choose to manufacture in the future , because we must consider the costs of energy and environment for manufacturing . \nManufacturing for alternative energy has a much needed future . \nThis is thinking for America . \nIf we were to think for the world , we should stop globalization and resume local self-supporting economy in order to minimize more energy consumption in shipping intermediate and finished goods around the globe . \nUnfortunately , most costs of the imported goods are spent on energy and profits for few , not to improve workers ' lives around the world . \nIn fact , it takes independence away from the poor people in underdeveloped countries . \nNow they have to depend on big corporations for their livelihood ; and corporations would close the plant faster than they started it if they find a cheaper location . \nWorkers are left high and dry without any land to support themselves . \nFor us , we send more garbage to our landfill than before , because cheaper goods can be easily replaced . \nA second stimulus check wo n't stimulate anything as shown by the first check . \nIt is irresponsible to use it as bait for votes before November . \nAnti-globalization is not protectionism for the US . \nIf we are honest about globalization for personal profits , that is fine . \nIf we claim to globalize for a better Earth , we really have to think twice . \nOptimization techniques should not be applied blindly . \nThe decision-makers on Wall Street and in D.C. must understand that qualitative data analysis is just as important as quantitative methods . \nThe definition of the space you are to optimize is the No. 1 question you have to ask yourself . \nIs it just this project , your whole organization , your state , your country or our Earth that you want to optimize for minimal costs or maximal profits ? \nThe problem is that optimizers are not decision-makers and they do n't understand each other . \nThey hear only what they want to hear . \nFareed fails to note that it was a Republican who started this whole mess ... Ronald Raygun , the high priest of trickle down economics , who gave us the voodoo doll of tax cuts , and the Republican borrow and spend scheme . \nRemember Dick Cheney 's `` deficits do n't matter '' mantra ? \nFareed mentions that the deficit was 3 trillion in 1990 , but he does n't point out that the deficit was less than a trillion before Reagan took office , or that Bush , with the help of his Republican supporters in Congress , more than doubled the deficit in just 8 years . \nThis reader hopes that the silver lining turns out to be a wholesale rejection of Reagan economics , a permanent Republican minority , a whole series of reforms that end the corruption of our political process by money , including the idea that money is speech , and a rebuilding of this country productive capability and education system . \nGovernment is not the problem , except when the Republicans are in power . \nToo little government is as bad as too much government . \nI find it interesting that Mr. Zakaria considers infra - structure spending to be investment . \nI am pretty sure that infra-structures like roads , bridges and building improvements are consumption spending when made by the government . \nAll the funds are dispersed immediately in new jobs and consumption of materials . \nThey would benefit from the consumption multiplier effect since they are immediately injected into the economy and would benefit from the marginal propensity to consume which is much higher than the marginal propensity to invest . \nThat is why Obama 's plan to infuse the economy with these needed programs will create new jobs and do a lot more good than McCane 's program of freezing government spending which will so down job creation . \nNot to dispute Mr. Zakaria 's persuasive arguments above , btu I would like to suggest there is another , albeit less significant , silver lining to be found . \nI believe that the current credit crisis has done more to curtail identity theft issues than anything the government has tried so far . \nThe upside of this mess is that we may be forced to invest in initiatives that pay dividends by creating jobs -LRB- Neo-NRA\\/WPA -RRB- . \nAnother unintended upside is that the playing field , which has never been close to level , as the economic darwinists insist , may level somewhat now that everyone is sharing some pain . \nIt also helps Obama , if he gets elected , because there is nowhere to go but up , unless the whole deal does a 1929 nosedive , in which case he 'll probably be strung up . \nFluff peice stating the obvious . \nStick with foreign policy . \nYou 're good at that . \nUm , who says the politicians -- or the me , me generations since WWII -- will learn anything new ? \nThe pols already know that a recession during an election year is bad -LRB- for them -RRB- and everybody will be relieved when the recession is over and they can start eyeing the Next Big Thing for quick profits , instead of looking long term and buying value . \nUntil someone wakes up -- and it 's likely that it will be other countries in the global economy that shake us from our stupor , as well as a good portion of our prosperity -- nothing will change . \nCrimes when you or I do the same ! \nPerpetual crime would be a better description for the current situation . \nIn 1978 Nebraska Gov. Jame Exon was about to appoint a Grand Island , NE banker to NE State Banking Director , Riley was his name . \nA Nebraska man met with then Gov. Exon & NE State Attorney General Paul Douglas & showed them proof of Riley 's banking irregularities , floating million dollar notes . \nExon did n't appoint Riley to state bankoing director but Bob Kerry when elected Gov , did . \nFive years later Commonwealth Savings & Loan & Nebraska State Securities went under ! \nThe truth was covered up all the way to DC . \nPaul Douglas was later convicted , -LCB- overturned on appeal -RCB- & the crimes were allowed to continue . \nThere were tapes of everybody who was anybody in Nebraska politics , involving sexual abuse with kids . \nThose tapes were in the Omaha police dept. evidence room & seen by many people . \nThose tapes later disappeared . \nThere is still one Nebraska man fighting to retrieve the money he lost in Commonwealth & State Securities . \nReuben Worster lost his life 's savings which was to be used to care for his handicapped son . \nThe man who met with Gov. Exon in 1978 & Reuben Worster were both American Veterans ! \nOne more example of why no man should fight for America ! \nOur representatives take campaign contributions , have taken $ 64 million from the failed banking , insurance , & investment companies we 've already bailed out in return for NO regulation which has led US to this point ! \nThese same politicians have been all about fixing the problem while insisting there is plenty of blame to go around but we muct fix the problem first . \nThey are in fact covering up their crimes !!!! They have all made billions of $ & will make billions more in the recovery which the American people will finance . \nWhile Americans lose their life savings , 401s & investments which are falling daily , these crook we pay to represent US are at it again . \nThey have done the same only worse than they did in the eighties , they 've included the world in their crimes & the world is being taken along with US taxpayers , again ! \nIf we would have held them accountable in the eighties it may not be happening now . \nIf we do n't hold them accontable now , it will happen again ! \nAlong with campaign finance this is the greatest scam the world has ever seen . \nRegarding this : `` The U.S. economy remains extremely dynamic . \nEven now , the most surprising data continue to be how resilient the economy has been through the recent shocks . '' \nIn other words , the fundamentals are sound ? \nNow where have I heard that before ? \nSo I guess you are saying we should not take our cues from the two Presidential candidates who refuse to admit that their pie-in-the-sky economic proposals need to change ? \nFareed , PLEASE keep up the good work - HOWEVER , apparently you did n't see that Speaker Pelosi & Harry Reid are already putting together plans for another `` STIMULUS '' package of at least $ 150B . \nNeither appear to have gotten your message as the money for this is not going to be coming from OUR treasury - UNLESS there is another provision in Obama 's financial strategy for certain `` segments '' to pay even higher taxes . \nHope you will write about the `` Pelosi Plan '' No Doubt about it , When Franklin Raines who ran one of the Fannies into the ground , stated to Congress that they were going to start loaning to people who were just a '' notch below normal credit requirements '' to get a loan we started down a slippery slope . \nAdd in the greed on Wallstreet and we have the mess were in today ! \nWe need to hold people accountable for their actions starting with the Congress and then going after the White collar Wall Streeters ! \nThank you Mr. Fareed Zakaria . \nThe banks , credit cards companies , and unscrupulous mortgage lenders selling free money from the wealthy trying to make more money has bit them right in their opulent life style . \nToo bad for them but as you well know the rich will survive just as they did after 1929 but the pain will fall on to the workers that made the wealthy rich . \nRegardless of where you look around the world the story is the same for the working class . \nThe poor dopes that are taken advantage of by the wealthy thinkng that some how the rich realy care about them . \nSir , since the discovery of the civilised world 's largest natural gas reserves in the Netherlands , 50 years ago , we now all start to feel and even understand the consequences of toxic conduct by past leadership , aggressive and abusive industrial dominance and arrogant , lax authorities tangled with special interests linked with ubiquitous cheap-oil pressure : imploding states and exploding nations . \nNational lawmaking gives way for international criminal constricts of unknowable scale . \nDeal ' 63 , the American contract with Europe coupled oil and natural-gas prices , hence the petrodollar is still dictating European institutional behavior . \nThe devastating power of borderless corporate identity now took its toll described as current events that could be met with measures of the same character as if the situation came out of the blue . \nBut , America should be thought capable of confronting this hidden development of bad manners and faltering education dictated by a globally instated greed-machination based on energy-fundamentals . \nThe world has seen big and bold US steps before . \nThis negative conduct spiral however is based on world-wide US-imposed cheap-oil principles of profit that leave no room for equality , the desired 100 % tranparency , real innovation , competition , change and progress . \nThe bedrock problem of quality , stability and sustainability has no easy quantity solution . \nThe emerged proof and widely misinterpreted rootcause of the current chaos and crisis rests in the asymmetrics of accepted behavior and the discrepancy between perceived and expected performance related to havily advertised state-corporate promoted achievements of growth that caused the unequal distribution of the greater good . \nThe questionis : why would the US people still opt out on Atlantic Unbundling of oil and gas pricing , e.i. rebalancing of the toxic petrodollar towards the already exiting diplomatic gaseuro as the only credible way out of misery ? \nTaking the silver lined bitter pill would save the entire world from unthinkable costs and damages to come . \nIt may come as a shock to many readers of the WP , but it is better to earn it before you spend it . \nIf only congress could get that message . \nAmerica needs to do more than go back to its financial roots . \nIt needs to go back to all its roots . \nWe used to manufacture what we consumed , but now we do n't . \nWe used to be able to get college loans , but now we ca n't . \nWe used to be covered by health care through employers , but now 48 million can not . \nWe used to have pensions through our companies but now we do not . \nWe used to innovate , but now we are stuck on oil . \nOne way to look at the problem is that risk has been shifted from ` we ' to ` I ' . \nPure unbridled capitalism , as practiced by the GOP , is seen as failed a failed ideology along with communism . \nWe are now busy socializing our banks , but do n't stop there . \nContinue and socialize a few other things as well , including medicine and energy . \nDo n't be scared by socialism . \nWe use it a lot in America already . \nFor example vets get socialized medicine from Uncle Sam from the VA. . \nOur fire departments used to be for profit . \nThe trouble was , they 'd pull up to a fire and start haggling over the price to put it out . \nSuch abuses were ended when our fire services became socialized . \nPrimary education is socialized for the most part and works quite well . \nHow the Cow jumped over the moon : a fable One day Farmer Abner took his Appaloosa to the livestock market . \nThere he met Farmer Bill with his Belgian and Farmer Clem with his Clydesdale . \n`` What do you reckon they 're worth ? '' \neach one asked the others . \n`` The value of a thing is what the thing will bring , '' they agreed . \nAbner offered his horse for sale first . \nThe auction opened at $ 100 , but to Abner 's surprise and great joy , Bill and Clem entered into a spirited bidding competition for the Appaloosa , finally won by Bill . \nAbner pocketed $ 500 , less the auctioneer 's fee . \nNext , Bill put his Belgian up for sale . \nAbner , who was now without a horse of his own , bid fiercely against Clem , but eventually quit at $ 500 . \nBill accepted the money gleefully -- minus the commission , of course . \nFinally , Clem 's Clydesdale went on the block . \nThis time Abner outbid Bill and took delivery of the Clydesdale for the same price as the others , $ 500 . \nThe Cow-Bones index , the dosimeter of the livestock market , was at 500 . \nThat meant that the equity value of their holdings was $ 500 . \nSince they had done so well , all three went back to the market again the next day , eager to see if they could pick up some bargains or unload their new purchases at a profit . \nThe auctioneer started the bidding at $ 500 . \nBill and Clem bid desperately against one another for Abner 's Clydesdale ; once again , Bill won , but this time at the mind-boggling price of $ 3000 . \nThen Bill put the Appaloosa up for sale . \nAbner and Clem bid equally fiercely before the latter triumphed ; he too had to go to $ 3000 to secure his victory . \nIn order to cover the loan he took out to raise the purchase price , he decided to sell his other horse . \nThe bidding between Abner and Bill shot up to the $ 3000 level before Bill dropped out , leaving the Belgian in Abner 's hands . \nOf course , the auctioneer again deducted his fees , but Abner , Bill , and Clem were overjoyed at their success . \nThey were twenty times wealthier than when they started , at least on paper . \nAnd the Cow stood at 3000 . \nOn the third day , optimistic that the market would continue to rise , the three farmers -LRB- though they now thought of themselves as investors who farmed as a hobby -RRB- again entered the fray . \nThe bidding was insane ; pundits who followed the market had never seen anything like it . \nWhen the dust settled , Abner had repurchased the Appaloosa , Bill the Belgian , and Clem the Clydesdale -- in each case for the unheard-of , astounding price of $ 14,000 ! \nNone of them could believe his luck . \nEach went around saying , `` It 's a dream , I never believed that wealth on this scale could be mine . '' \nThe auctioneer was very satisfied too . \nAnd the Cow jumped over the moon . \nIt ended the day at 14,000 . \nMoral : The Market will decide . \nThe next day the market was closed , so Abner , Bill , and Clem went back to their farms , leading their horses on halters rather than riding . \n`` You do n't want to take chances with a 14,000-dollar investment , '' they said . \nOn the way they met Farmer Zeke , who was riding a bicycle . \nThey told him of their new wealth , understandably proud of the acumen that had earned it , and they bragged a little . \n`` Have you ever before in your life seen a horse worth $ 14,000 ? '' \nWhy , I would n't give you a hundred dollars for those plugs , '' exclaimed Zeke . \n`` If they were good for anything at all you would n't be walking . '' \nDr. Fareed Zakaria hit it right on . \nSending math or physics Ph.D. s to Wall Street is such a waste of productivity and talent . \nIf a country depends on finance as much as 30 % of all S&P profits , it will be too late when everyone realizes that there are only emperor 's clothes on Wall Street . \nMost people on Wall Street claimed they do n't know how derivatives work , although Alan Greenspan still hails its usefulness . \nThese Ph.D. s either have a job or no job . \nThe money is just too good to say No to Wall Street . \nThis is what happens when our short-sighted Congress canceled our Superconducting Super Collider in the middle of its construction . \n`` NPR , September 10 , 2008 For some American scientists , the official start-up of the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva , Switzerland is a bittersweet moment . \nOnce it becomes fully operational , this new collider will be the most powerful machine of its kind in the world . \nIt 's designed to smash protons together to reveal the basic building blocks that make up the universe . \nThe Superconducting Super Collider was actually under construction when Congress killed the project back in 1993 , during a period of budget cutbacks . '' \n- NPR Mr. Zakaria is absolutely right that the present economic crisis provides a cautionary tale for a government that has been a profligate spender and borrower . \nThe crisis also teaches the dangers of having had a financial community which took risks in uncharted areas and without soberly considering the depth of the downside . \nThe current predicament , moreover , carries a lesson for individual Americans who had become addicted to consumerism and its necessary counterpart of ever-mounting , unpayable debt . \nIf these truths are appreciated , although history tells us that people tend to develop amnesia about such unpleasant things , then the `` silver lining '' of which Mr. Zakaria writes will become a reality . \nWhat Mr. Zakaria 's upbeat article glosses over , however , is the terrible price being paid for the `` silver lining '' by the millions of Americans who played by the rules and did not run up a personal debt and did not condone the deficit spending or lack of regulatory oversight by the Bush administration and had no idea that the nation 's largest investment houses and commercial banks were speculating on highly leveraged instruments they did not even understand . \nWith a negative savings rate there will be a huge consumer squeeze that will eventually lead to a sounder financial less credit driven society . \nThe housing price decline is of special interest to WOMEN as last years statistics show 22 % of new home buyers were unmarried women . \nFor an intriguing look at some of the issues facing the 100 million unmaried American population see `` Single a documentary film '' www.singlefilm.com Nice article by Fareed Zakaria . \nIn the short term , there is pain and loss ... But we have to live within our means ... All this time , when worries about the subprime mortgage fiasco were surfacing , NOBODY , but NOBODY from the government -LRB- Bush , ignorant and at the wheel-my God who we elected as President ... -RRB- nor Paulson -LRB- and he was in charge at Goldman Sacks-and still had no clue !!! - does n't that tell you all yo need to know ?!!! ... -RRB- took a look to see what was happening . \nALL of them were acquiescing and enabling this whole fiasco and Ponzi scheme to go on and on ... what a shame ...

{"txt": "AJDABIYAH , Libya | Wed Mar 30 , 2011 11:32 am EDT AJDABIYAH , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Rebels beat a rapid retreat east on Wednesday , ceding land and a series of oil towns as quickly as they had taken them after Muammar Gaddafi 's forces unleashed rockets and artillery on lightly armed rebel forces . \nAided by Western air strikes , rebels had made a two-day charge along more than 200 km -LRB- 125 mile -RRB- of barren coast and seized strategic oil terminals . \nThey have now retreated , giving up gains to Gaddafi 's better armed troops . \nThe failure of the rebels to hold ground and put pressure on Gaddafi , despite more than 10 days of Western-led air strikes , is likely to unsettle the United States , Britain , France and others who want to see the Libyan leader step down . \nHundreds of rebel pick-ups mounted with machine guns and other vehicles streamed east of Brega with little sign of order , heading toward Ajdabiyah , a town that rebels took five days to retake from Gaddafi even after air strikes were launched . \n`` We are going to Ajdabiyah , '' said rebel fighter Mohamed al-Abreigi . \n`` We will gather there and , God willing , we will head back to Brega today . '' \nDozens of rebel vehicles gathered at the western gate to Ajdabiyah , a town which lies about 140 km -LRB- 90 miles -RRB- south of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nBut rebels did not seem to be regrouping into defensive positions there . \nOne man in military fatigues shouted : `` Civilians inside , civilians inside . '' \nWhen asked what was happening , one rebel said : `` We do n't know . \nThey say there may be a group -LRB- from Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- coming from the south . '' \nTo the south is open desert . \nAjdabiyah , battered by the to-and-fro of fighting , stands at the gateway to the rebel held east of Libya . \nIt is located on a key junction with one route heading to Benghazi and another northeast to the oil port of Tobruk near the Egyptian border . \nLibyan families were fleeing north to Benghazi as news of the retreat spread . \nThe road out of Ajdabiyah was packed with cars carrying families and their belongings . \nRebels had advanced beyond the coastal town of Bin Jawad , about 525 km -LRB- 330 miles -RRB- east of the capital Tripoli . \nBut as they approached Gaddafi 's hometown of Sirte , they came up against the Libyan leader 's heavier weaponry . \n`` Gaddafi 's forces have Grad -LRB- rockets -RRB- which have a range of 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- ...

'' \nBut the apparent aerial attack showed no sign of slowing down Gaddafi 's advance or halting the pace of the rebel retreat . \nSome 10-15 km -LRB- 6-10 miles -RRB- west of Brega , around a dozen rebel fighters stopped by the road and trained their guns south into the Sahara . \nWisps of smoke could be seen in the distance . \n`` They -LRB- Gaddafi 's forces -RRB- are coming from the desert , '' yelled one fighter . \nAnother fired his Kalashnikov rifle in the air to scare away a group of camels . \nThere was no sign of the rebels forming any determined defense of the sprawling oil town of Brega . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe fact is that a substantial number of the rebels will include jihadist agitators -LRB- assuming U.S. intel has not relied entirely on Gaddafi 's claims over the past few years -RRB- who have encouraged , supported , incited and even spearheaded the revolution , and will not be without honor in any new government that the West will have to deal with . \nHow does one arrange security and intel with a future government whose security includes Al Qaida or jihadist moles and even open sympathizers ? \nJohn McCain might want also to consider mission-creep against forces that know how to make strategic retreats , how to ambush , how to cache and deploy heavy arms in and around cities -LRB- and just how much they have cached -RRB- , inaccessible to air strikes , how well motivated G 's forces really are , etc. . \nThe U.N. has fashioned a general economic noose for G. , the coalition is striking systematically at his forces ' materiel , and there is no turning back . \nBut there is no reason to ramp it up either . \nThis is a war of attrition , nothing more , nothing less . \nThere has been way too much talking by the coalition diplomats when the Libyan rebels need air power , long range artillery\\/rockets , and tanks . \nAre all these US and NATO Politicians and Military general completely STUPID . \nCommon sense appears in very short supply . \nA civil war is raging in Libya . \nGadhafi has a trained military army . \nThe rebels have no trained military army . \nWE can knock out all Gadhafi 's air power etc but that still leaves his ground soldiers . \nAnd UN 1970 resolution is to protect civilians only . \nSo how do you stop Gadhafi troops when they enter cities without us killing civilians . \nAnswer you need to put `` boots on the ground '' to fight Gadhafi troops and then we have another IRAQ to suck up lives and squander tax dollars . \nAnd the UN resolution 1970 is ignored . \nHas anyone learned any lessons ... . \nAnd remember there are 6 or 7 dictators in countries around Libya who crush their people , so will we bomb them also . \nThese med-evil countries live by the Sharia Law and have been killing each other for centuries . \nThey are not going to stop . \nWe should get the hell out , and let them murder one another . \nOnce their OIL is gone , we will have NO interest in them . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/libyawar_reuters/rsd/LibyaWar_reuters__2011-03-30__298.rsd.txt"}

{"txt": "TRIPOLI | Tue Jul 26 , 2011 2:51 pm BST TRIPOLI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Efforts to find a deal to end the civil war in Libya intensified on Tuesday , with a U.N. special envoy heading for Tripoli and Western powers signalling that Muammar Gaddafi could stay in the country if he gives up power . \nU.N. envoy Abdul Elah al-Khatib , who visited the rebels in Benghazi on Monday , is looking for a `` political process '' that will end a war that has failed to dislodge Gaddafi despite months of rebel attacks backed by NATO bombing raids . \nFrance and other Western members of the anti-Gaddafi coalition have signalled that the Libyan leader could stay in the country provided he and his circle agree to step down . \nA rebel leader this week appeared to endorse this view , which would mark a major shift in policy as previous demands have insisted that Gaddafi must leave the country . \nDeadlines are approaching for the NATO-led alliance , whose mandate for military action expires on September 27 . \nHopes have also been expressed that some agreement could be reached before the holy month of Ramadan begins at the start of August . \nBritain and France , two of the main backers of the campaign to end Gaddafi 's four decades in charge of the North African oil-producing nation , held talks in London at which they called once more for Gaddafi to leave power . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague and his French counterpart Alain Juppe also said that it was up to the Libyan people to decide their own future . \nBritish officials said there had been no change of policy direction , but the comments were interpreted as tacit backing for the proposal that Gaddafi can remain in Libya after quitting . \n`` `` We have been clear from the beginning that Gaddafi must go , '' Hague told reporters . \n`` The best way of showing the Libyan people they need no longer be in fear of Gaddafi would be for him to leave Libya . \n`` So that very much remains our position , but it 's also very clear that whatever is settled is a settlement which the Libyan people are happy with . \nIt 's for them to determine their future , not for those outside to try to lay down that future . '' \nJuppe , who has already endorsed the idea of Gaddafi remaining in Libya after leaving power , added : `` As far as we are concerned , Gaddafi should renounce any kind of power in Libya and he must commit himself to not play any kind of role . '' \n`` Gaddafi is going to have to abandon power and then it will be for the Libyan people to decide what their future will be , '' Juppe said . \nGaddafi has supported talks with the rebels and with the West . \nBut while he has made clear he backs the idea of his remaining in Libya , he has shown no sign in public of agreeing to the other part of the deal -- stepping down from power . \nWhile rebel forces have been unable to move decisively against Gaddafi , they have accused neighbouring Algeria of bolstering his troops by turning a blind eye to an arms shipment . \nAlgeria denied it had allowed the weapons to be offloaded at an Algerian port . \nIn his talks with the Benghazi-based rebel leadership council , Khatib , the U.N. envoy , discussed ideas for ending the war but said a firm initiative had yet to take shape . \nWith a diplomatic push to end the conflict gathering steam , Khatib told Reuters he would canvass government views in Tripoli on Tuesday . \n`` We did not put a plan in front of them . \nWe discussed the views and ideas on how we can trigger a political process ... to achieve a political solution , '' he said . \nLibyan officials said they expected the Tripoli talks , with senior Gaddafi aides , would cover peace negotiations . \nBut they also wanted to focus on civilian casualties and a desire to urge NATO to stop its air strikes . \nNATO has continued to hammer Gaddafi forces around Libya , striking twice in central Tripoli on Monday , and Britain has said there would be no let-up during Ramadan . \nBut hopes have grown for a negotiated end to a war that has dragged on longer than many initially expected . \nSpeaking to Reuters after meeting Khatib , senior rebel official Mahmoud Jibril said he had underlined that the rebels would not accept any initiative that did not involve the removal of Gaddafi from power as a first step to peace . \nKhatib , a senior Jordanian politician , has said his ideas involve an agreement on a cease-fire and , simultaneously , on setting up a mechanism to manage the transitional period . \nHe has not given details . \n`` So far , there is no initiative . \nHe is trying to propose some general ideas , see what is acceptable and what is not acceptable , and on the basis of that he can propose an initiative , '' Jibreel said . \nThe rebel leaders have given conflicting signals in recent weeks over whether they would allow Gaddafi and his family to stay in Libya as part of a deal , providing he gave up power . \nIn the latest comment on the issue , opposition leader Mustafa Abdel Jalil told the Wall Street Journal that it would be acceptable . \n`` Gaddafi can stay in Libya but it will have conditions , '' he said . \n`` We will decide where he stays and who watches him . \nThe same conditions will apply to his family . '' \nThe poorly armed rebels seem unlikely to quickly unseat Gaddafi . \nRebels announced they had almost taken the oil town of Brega , but later said that minefields had slowed their advance . \nWhile rebels in the east received a boost this week when Turkey delivered its first cargo of fuel under a multi-million dollar supply deal , a government rocket attack has cut fuel supplies in the frontline western town of Misrata . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nHe has fought the rebels and NATO to a standstill . \nHe has effectively won . \nNATO will , in a few months , make some kind of excuse for leaving Libya , and then Gaddafi 's army will move in decisively on the rebels and finish them off . \nThousands will be executed and Gaddafi will go down in history as the man who beat us all . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/libyawar_reuters/rsd/LibyaWar_reuters__2011-07-26__150.rsd.txt.sent-fake"}
{"txt": "Finger pointing towards intensive farming is spreading like the H1N1 virus itself ; it 's time for an urgent inquiry to find out the facts The growing concern over the H1N1 swine flu virus a particularly alarming combination of swine , avian , and human viruses which has now reached the UK seems to have come almost out of nowhere . \nThe World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- is now calling the virus , which has infected an estimated 1,000 people and killed around 150 in Mexico , an `` international public health emergency '' that could reach global pandemic levels . \nBut as Dr Michael Greger , director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture at the Humane Society of the United States , has pointed out , this is not the first time a triple hybrid human\\/bird\\/pig flu virus has been uncovered . \nThe first was found in a North Carolina industrial pig farm in 1998 , and within a year it had spread across the United States . \nDr Greger has highlighted how some experts blamed the emergence of the original 1998 virus on intensive farming practices in the US , where pigs and poultry are raised in extremely cramped conditions , in adjacent sheds and tended to by the same staff . \nNorth Carolina has the densest pig population in North America , with around twice as many swine mega-factories as any other state . \nIn 1998 , North Carolina 's pig population had hit ten million , up from two million just six years before . \nYet the number of hog farms was decreasing , with more and more animals being crammed into fewer and fewer farms . \nSince the primary route of swine flu transmission is thought to be the same as human flu , the increased potential for the spread of disease in such conditions is clear . \nMore research is urgently needed to explore the potential link between industrialised animal farming , and the spread of disease . \nSome elements of the Mexican media are already pointing to the potential role of intensive pig farming in Mexico , which has grown substantially in recent years , with some giant operations raising tens of thousands of pigs at a time . \nSince news of the epidemic broke , reports in Mexico City daily La Jornada and Veracruz-based paper La Marcha have detailed how a number of community residents in the affected areas have expressed concerns over the operations of Smithfield Foods , the world 's largest pork packer and hog producer . \nAccording to these reports , in Veracruz where the outbreak originated , a Smithfield subsidiary called Granjas Carrol raises 950,000 hogs per year in intensive conditions . \nSmithfield has released a statement denying any link between the outbreak and Granjas Carrol 's operations in Mexico . \nIt said the company routinely administers influenza virus vaccinations to its herds and conducts monthly tests for the presence of swine influenza . \nIt said it had found no clinical signs or symptoms of swine influenza on its farms . \nThis is not the first time intensive , industrialised agriculture has been accused of spreading disease . \nRecent avian flu outbreaks , for example , have shown the extent to which the export-oriented corporate model of poultry production may have spread strains such as H5N1 . \nIn my report Avian flu : time to shut the intensive poultry flu factories ? \nof 2006 , I outlined how bird flu has been endemic in wild birds in much of the world without leaping the species barrier and causing people any harm . \nBut in damp and cramped conditions , a series of mutations can occur resulting in a highly pathogenic form . \nWithin crowded chicken factory farms , the mild virus can evolve rapidly towards more dangerous and highly transmissible forms , capable of jumping species and spreading back into wild birds , which are defenceless against the new strain . \nExperts are increasingly warning that the practices of intensive farming must be reviewed and regulated . \nWhile it will be difficult to reach any firm conclusions about this current outbreak of swine flu until more details emerge , it is crucial that the authorities undertake an urgent inquiry , in order to better understand the development and spread of animal-based epidemics which can be lethal to humans . \ncents Caroline Lucas is Green party MEP for the south-east of England Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian . \nTime for a ban .

{"txt": "`` The cost is colossal , '' says Abdulhafid Zlitni , Libya 's planning and finance minister The suspension of oil and gas exports accounts for a huge chunk of that , he says Mammoth construction projects , now abandoned , still dot the Libyan landscape Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Libyan government in Tripoli estimates the grinding conflict that has been tearing the country apart for the past five months has cost the national economy some $ 50 billion . \n`` The cost is colossal , '' said Abdulhafid Zlitni , planning and finance minister for the Tripoli government . \nIn an interview with CNN , Zlitni said the suspension of oil and gas exports had accounted for a huge chunk of the losses . \n`` The income foregone because of the stoppage of the export of oil is something like $ 20 billion , '' he said . \nThis has brought an end to what had been a surge in prosperity for the North African country . \nLast year , Libya 's economy was booming , with gross domestic product surging 10.3 % , according to the International Monetary Fund . \nAnd in a report published February 15 , the IMF 's executive board concluded , `` The outlook for Libya 's economy remains favorable . '' \nBut two days later , protests against Col. Moammar Gadhafi 's 41-year rule erupted in the eastern city of Benghazi . \nAs protests spread to other cities and towns across the country , the Gadhafi regime embarked on a bloody crackdown . \nToday , the country is split into territories controlled by loyalists and opposition rebels . \nA NATO military alliance is now into the fourth month of a campaign of airstrikes against government targets after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilian lives . \nThe civil war has all but shattered ambitious plans to upgrade transport , housing and infrastructure in a country that had long been isolated from the international community . \n`` The main objective was to create capacity for the economy to stand on its feet away from oil and gas production , '' recalled Zlitni somewhat wistfully , as he described a five-year , $ 170 billion plan to modernize Libya . \nIn March , the legions of foreign workers who had been contracted to build railroads , airports , apartment buildings and telecommunications networks began fleeing the rapidly escalating conflict by the tens of thousands . \nThe exodus included large numbers of engineers , construction and oil workers from China , Turkey , Egypt , and the Philippines , who crossed the western border with Tunisia on foot . \nAt the time , many of them told CNN stories of being robbed at gunpoint by Libyan security forces who took their cell phones , laptops and money . \nLeft behind were mammoth construction projects that still dot the Libyan landscape . \nMany of these unfinished structures were apartment buildings being built for an estimated 50,000 families across the country . \n`` So many infrastructure projects ... were carried out by international companies , '' Zlitni said . \n`` Yet the stoppage of these projects could be felt in the economy . \nParticularly in the building sectors , the transportation sectors , the communication sectors . '' \nMore ominous for the Libyan economy has been the Tripoli government 's growing isolation . \nNATO is enforcing a no-fly zone over Gadhafi-controlled territory as well as a virtual blockade of Libyan ports . \nThe sanctions have created huge fuel shortages . \nLong lines of cars now wait at service stations . \nThis week , the government in Tripoli announced it was intervening to control rising prices of basic commodities . \n`` In a crisis situation like this traders tend to profit more than they should , and therefore there is an intervention by the ministry of foreign trade for the prices of consumer goods , '' Zlitni said . \nThe minister said the government was fixing prices of rice , flour , meat , eggs , sugar and edible oils to prevent hardship among lower-income families . \n`` We subsidize , basically , '' Zlitni said , `` with large amount of funds . '' \nBut Zlitni warned it was growing increasingly difficult for the embattled Gadhafi regime to pay for these types of subsidies . \nHe pointed out that foreign countries have frozen tens of billions of dollars in Libyan government assets that had been carefully invested overseas in `` treasury bills , bonds , stocks and investments in various international markets , whether in Europe , the USA or Asia . '' \nZlitni compared Libya 's dwindling government coffers to the edible meat on an animal . \n`` This should n't last long , otherwise we 'll be eating the fat and meat . \nAnd we 'll very soon arrive to the bones . '' \nThroughout the hour-long interview , Zlitni made no mention of the fact that last month , the U.N. Security Council added his name to a list of high-ranking officials in the Gadhafi regime now facing an international travel ban . \nHe did , however , declare Tripoli 's opposition to proposals to hand over frozen Libyan government bank accounts to the opposition Transitional National Council headquartered in Benghazi . \nLast week , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced Washington formally recognized the council in Benghazi as Libya 's legitimate governing authority . \nState department officials said this could potentially give Benghazi access to some $ 30 billion in frozen Libyan funds in the United States . \n`` This is against international rules . \nThe international monetary system can not withstand action in this manner , '' Zlitni said . \n`` If you are freezing through United Nations Security Council action funds for any country , then you ca n't confiscate it . \nThere are legal obligations of the banks . '' \nBut when asked what recourse Tripoli would have if the U.S. government went through with its threat , Zlitni conceded there are few options . \n`` We should file litigation against them , '' he said .

'' \nRomanian officials have acknowledged some of their economic difficulties but said concerns about the country 's stability are overblown . \nIn an Oct. 22 speech , President Traian Basescu pinned the blame on `` corrupt '' outsiders . \n`` There were smart guys coming to Romania , who had studied at Harvard and Oxford , and they invented how to increase the value of one 's shares without actually having money , '' he said . \nOfficials here have brushed aside talk of an IMF bailout , which would be a setback for a country that joined the E.U. just last year . \nThey especially reject comparisons to Iceland , which has been hit so hard that bankrupt entrepreneurs are now looking for jobs as cod fishermen . \n`` I am sick and tired of comparing Romania to the Baltic states and Iceland . \nWhat do we have in common ?

{"txt": "Obama defends Gulf of Mexico oil spill response President Obama : `` People are going to be frustrated until -LRB- the leak -RRB- stops '' US President Barack Obama has defended his government 's handling of the huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nHe unveiled a series of measures , including a continued moratorium on drilling permits for six months . \nThe move comes after an opinion poll said 60 % of Americans were unhappy with the government 's response . \nBP has resumed pumping heavy mud into the ruptured well after a pause to assess the effect of its `` top kill '' operation . \nThe procedure is aimed at stemming the oil flow , from what some experts say is the country 's worst-ever spill . \nNew estimates from a panel of US scientists said at least 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons -RRB- were leaking into the Gulf every day , far exceeding the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster . \nThe leak was caused by an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig on 20 April , which also killed 11 workers . \nSpeaking at the White House , President Obama vowed to hold BP accountable for the `` horrific disaster '' . \nHe stressed that his administration , and not oil company BP , was in charge . \nIf pressure and density sufficient , oil and gas flow stops But he admitted the government did not have the technology to deal with the damaged oil well nearly a mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- below the surface , meaning that Washington must rely on BP to plug the ruptured well . \nThe president 's comments came as questions were increasingly being asked about whether he had been sufficiently engaged in handling the disaster , says the BBC 's Adam Brookes in Washington . \nIn a shake-up of the offshore oil industry , Mr Obama suspended test drilling on 33 rigs in the Gulf of Mexico , as well as halting exploratory deepwater drilling for another six months . \nIn addition , he canceled the sale of some offshore leases off the coasts of Alaska and Virginia . \nCorrespondents say the move marks a shift in policy since March , when President Obama gave the go-ahead to widen the scope for offshore drilling in order to reduce dependency on oil imports . \nHours before Mr Obama spoke , the head of the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , which oversees drilling operations , resigned . \nElizabeth Birnbaum and the MMS have come under fire from lawmakers over lax oversight of drilling operations . \nThe president blasted the `` scandalously close relationship '' between oil companies and regulators , and said officials granting exploration permits would no longer be responsible as well for ensuring safety . \nAlso on Thursday , Mr Obama 's top spill response official - Coast Guard commander Admiral Thad Allen - approved part of an ambitious plan to build barrier islands to stop oil from coming ashore in Louisiana . \nThe oil leak has already soiled more than 110km -LRB- 70 miles -RRB- of Louisiana 's coastline , threatening fragile marshlands and putting the Louisiana fishing industry at risk . \nIn the first official estimate of the size of the oil leak , US Geological Survey Director Marcia McNutt said government teams estimated the flow ranges from 12,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 gallons or 1.9 million litres -RRB- to 25,000 barrels per day . \nUp to now , BP had estimated the leak at 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- per day , while cautioning that figure was unreliable . \nIf the new estimates are confirmed , it would mean the leak has far eclipsed the previous worst oil spill in US history - the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster . \nMaking matters worse , US officials warned the coming hurricane season could be one of the worst on record . \nBut BP said its latest attempt to stem the flow was making progress . \nIt would take 24-48 hours before BP engineers could tell whether the `` top kill '' procedure had worked , company officials said at about 2000 GMT on Thursday . \nThe procedure , which began on Wednesday , involves pumping heavy drilling fluids into the top of the well to try to halt the oil flow . \nIf it succeeds , cement would then be injected to seal the well . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

{"txt": "LONDON , March 30 -- At this week 's summit of world leaders , the big winner will be the developing world , with the United States , Europe and Japan offering China , India , Brazil and other emerging nations unprecedented new influence in global financial decisions . \nSeveral major developing countries -- most notably China -- are also in late-stage negotiations to win new authority to shape decisions at the Washington-based International Monetary Fund , an organization that developing nations have long complained dictate to them rather than hear them out . \nThe new role for developing nations signifies a tilt in the world economic order being accelerated by the financial crisis . \nTheir leaders blame the collapse of financial institutions on bad management and poor regulations by the West , which , they argue , has robbed rich countries of the moral authority to rebuild financial standards on their own . \n`` This crisis was fostered and boosted by irrational behavior of some people that are white , blue-eyed , '' Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told reporters in Brasilia last week after a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown . \n`` Before the crisis they looked like they knew everything about economics , and they have demonstrated they know nothing about economics . '' \nThe one-day London summit is expected to end Thursday with leaders from many of the world 's biggest economies agreeing on new regulations for banks and hedge funds , a large increase in funding for the IMF and a pledge to fight protectionism . \nBut early versions of a draft communique the leaders are expected to release indicate that there will be relatively few specifics on those issues . \nThey are also expected to tread lightly on U.S. calls -- opposed by many in Europe -- to boost government spending worldwide to combat the global economic crisis . \nU.S. officials indicated last week that they would not press nations to adhere to specific spending targets . \nInstead , analysts said that perhaps the most concrete agreement on Thursday will revolve around the new status bestowed on emerging countries . \nThe United States and Britain need the deep pockets of nations such as China and Saudi Arabia now more than ever as they seek buyers for billions of dollars worth of debt to cover the cost of stimulus spending and bank bailouts at home . \nIn response , China in particular is exerting more authority . \nBeijing has gone so far as to push for a new global reserve currency besides the U.S. dollar , a proposal that , while dismissed by Washington , will nevertheless get an airing in London this week . \nThe IMF , which since its inception at the end of World War II has been largely funded and controlled by rich nations , is also seeking significant new contributions from cash-rich emerging economies as it comes under enormous strain to bail out a growing number of hard-hit and poor countries . \nBut the largest developing countries , many of whose economies are growing despite the global downturn , have made it clear that in exchange for the cash , they want a seat at the decision-making table . \nTwo weeks ago at a finance ministers meeting ahead of the summit , Brazil , China , Russia and India issued their own communique saying they want more say in global affairs . \nThere has also been growing momentum to increase the presence of developing countries on other important bodies such as the United Nations Security Council . \n`` We call for urgent action with regard to voice and representation in the IMF in order that they better reflect their real economic weights , '' the four countries said in the communique . \nThe United States this week is proposing that five developing nations -- China , Brazil , Russia , Mexico and India -- be given more influence on IMF lending decisions in return for tens of billions of dollars in new donations , according to an administration official . \nWashington is looking for world leaders to endorse the idea this week , with details to be worked out before the IMF 's annual meeting in Washington next month . \nSome European governments , however , are cautious , fearing they would lose power in an institution traditionally headed by one of their own . \nThe global leaders this week are also set to endorse the expansion of the Financial Stability Forum in Switzerland , which will emerge with a new name -- the Financial Stability Board -- and a vastly expanded mission . \nThe organization currently brings together regulators , central bankers and finance ministers from a cluster of wealthy nations . \nThe new membership will include 10 emerging markets including Argentina , Brazil , South Africa and China . \nThe institution , which previously served as a little-used forum for exchanging ideas , will draft the details to enhance global standards for financial institutions , including benchmarks for executive pay and how much risk they can take on . \nCritics , however , charge that the entrance of so many emerging nations into the club at once could complicate the process . \n`` You can understand China ; they are part of the global financial system now and you have to hear them out , '' said Howard Davies , director of the London School of Economics . \n`` But while we may have messed things up royally , that does n't mean we should be taking advice from Argentina .

'' \nThe biggest worry was that the H1N1 virus could mutate , Benn said , and that a second wave of infections in the autumn could be more severe . \nAlan Johnson , the health secretary , said the spread of the H1N1 virus had largely been contained in the UK , though this might only last until the autumn . \n`` Our evidence from all previous pandemics is that you get two phases , '' he said . \n`` You get a first wave that is often very mild and then you get a much more serious wave that comes along in the autumn and the winter .

'' \nAt a midday news conference , the administration rolled out two Cabinet chiefs and other senior White House advisers to assert that the government would do whatever it could to help BP stop the leak . \nThe administration is well aware that the president 's campaign victory was built in part on a belief among voters that he would do a better job at responding to disasters like Hurricane Katrina than did President Bush . \n`` This is in that list : Are you competently running government ? '' \nHe said the news conference with senior officials was aimed at letting the press and the public `` know what we 've done to respond . '' \nJanet Napolitano , secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , said there were more than 50 vessels as well as aircraft deployed to the area of the spill and that workers had laid down 174,060 feet of absorbent foam booms and recovered 18,180 barrels of an oily mixture from the gulf 's surface . \nShe said they would also open a second command center in Mobile , Ala. , in addition to the one in Louisiana . \nThe Navy said it is sending 66,000 feet of inflatable boom and seven skimming systems , and would offer its bases in the region as staging areas for the operation . \nWhite House officials said they began holding regular conference calls with BP executives soon after the accident . \nOn Thursday , Obama also called the governors of the five Gulf Coast states , and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar met with oil and gas industry executives to appeal for ideas and help . \nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency and mobilized National Guard troops . \nOn Friday , Napolitano , Salazar and EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson will travel to the Gulf Coast at the president 's request with Carol Browner , the White House director of energy and climate change policy , and Jane Lubchenco , head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , to inspect ooperations dedicated to minimizing environmental risks . \nDespite these efforts , it remained possible that the oil leak could continue for as long as three months , by which time it would rival the size of the 1989 spill from the Exxon Valdez . \nIf efforts to reactivate the blowout-preventer fail , BP will try to lower 100-ton domes on top of the leaks in the pipes now lying on the sea floor and funnel the oil up through pipes to storage vessels . \nSuch methods have been used before , but generally at depths of 350 feet or less . \nBP also plans to start drilling a relief well Friday that would intercept the oil from the existing well and plug the leak , but the company said that could take several weeks . \nIt took more than two months to plug a similar well blowout off the coast of Australia late last year . \nBy that time , the damage from the spill could be extensive and the political effect on Obama 's offshore drilling plan and broader climate change agenda uncertain . \n`` I do n't know whether it changes our understanding of offshore oil , '' David Pumphrey , deputy director of the energy and national security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said of the accident . \n`` But I think it changes the political debate quite a bit . '' \nIn backing wider offshore oil and gas exploration only a month ago , Obama promised to `` employ new technologies that reduce the impact of oil exploration . '' \nHe acknowledged that his decision would provoke criticism from those who decried the expansion and those who said it did not go far enough . \n`` Ultimately , we need to move beyond the tired debates of the left and the right , between business leaders and environmentalists , between those who would claim drilling is a cure-all and those who would claim it has no place , '' Obama said . \nThe accident in the gulf may provide more firepower for the critics on the left who for years have lobbied presidents and Congress to keep in place federal moratoriums on further offshore exploration . \nThose moratoriums have expired . \nFlorida Sen. Bill Nelson -LRB- D -RRB- called on Obama to step back from his expanded offshore drilling plans . \nIn a letter to the president , Nelson said he would file legislation to ban the Interior Department from following through on Obama 's proposal for new seismic and drilling activity . \nHe said the gulf spill `` may be an environmental and economic disaster that wreaks havoc for commercial fishing and tourism along the Gulf of Mexico coast . '' \nDan McLaughlin , a top aide to Nelson , said it was too early to say whether the federal government had responded adequately to what he called `` our worst nightmare come true . '' \nBut McLaughlin asked why the government had not done more to ensure that the oil companies could shut down a well if a catastrophic failure happened . \n`` Somebody is going to have to ask the question as to why the regulators did n't put this question to the industry before ? '' \n`` If everything fails , then what ? '' \nThat inquiry will likely focus on the blowout-preventer , which like the sunken drilling rig was owned by Transocean . \nIn Norway , for example , blowout preventers are required to have a device known as an acoustic valve that can help assure activation in the event of an accident , but that device is n't required in the United States and was n't part of the blowout preventer used on this well . \nBP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said Wednesday that the blowout preventer had been inspected 10 days before the accident . \nThe Minerals Management Service , a part of the Interior Department that oversees safety on offshore rigs , said it would complete new inspections of all gulf exploration drilling rigs within seven days to prevent a repeat of the April 20 blast . \nObama aides stressed at the midday briefing that BP would bear the cost of the spill , including the cost of plugging the well , cleaning shorelines and paying for government air and water tests . \nSeparately , fishermen and others anticipating environmental damage filed class-action suits against the company . \nOn a day when the stock market rose broadly and sharply , BP 's stock price fell more than 8 percent to $ 52.56 a share .

'' \nBP 's beleaguered chief executive , Tony Hayward , yesterday drastically scaled upwards his assessment of the spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \n`` This is clearly an environmental catastrophe . \nThere is no two ways about it , '' he told CNN . \n`` It 's clear that we are dealing with a very significant environmental crisis and catastrophe . '' \nIn an interview with the Guardian two weeks ago , he had described the oil spill as `` tiny '' relative to the size of the gulf . \n`` The amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume , '' he said then . \nHowever he was optimistic that the `` top kill '' stood a good chance of success , which he put at 60-70 % . \n`` We have wrestled it to the ground , but we have n't put a bullet in its head yet , '' Hayward said . \nWith no immediate end in sight , there were growing concerns over the effects on public health of a prolonged exposure to the oil as well as to the more than 3,640,000 litres -LRB- 800,000 gallons -RRB- of chemical dispersants sprayed on the slick . \nEnvironmentalists and fishing groups in Louisiana say prolonged exposure to the oil , in the form of tiny airborne particles as well as dispersants , could be wreaking devastating damage on public health . \nThey also accuse BP of threatening to sack workers who try to turn up for clean-up duty wearing protective respirators , and the Obama administration of refusing to release results of air and water quality tests that would show the impact of crude oil and dispersants on the environment . \nWilma Subra , a chemist who has served as a consultant to the Environmental Protection Agency , said there was growing anecdotal evidence that locals were falling ill after exposure to tiny airborne particles of crude . \nAir quality data released earlier by the EPA suggested the presence of chemicals that while still within legal limits could be dangerous . \nBut Subra complained that the EPA was not releasing all data it had gathered from BP . \n`` Every time the wind blows from the south-east to the shore , people are being made sick , '' she said . \n`` It causes severe headaches , nausea , respiratory problems , burning eyes and sore throats . '' \nLong-term health effects include neurological disorders and cancer . \nSubra said there was even greater concern for those recruited to lay booms and skim crude off the water , since they were in closer proximity to the oil and the chemical dispersants . \nClint Guidry , of the Louisiana Shrimp Association , has accused BP of threatening to sack workers who turn up wearing respirators . \nThe oil firm said it was not aware of any workers being turned away , but noted that it was the responsibility of the Obama administration to decide whether such protective gear was warranted . \nHugh Kaufman , chief investigator for the EPA 's ombudsman , said he encountered similar worker safety policies after 9\\/11 . \n`` If people are wearing respirators , it scares people because they realize how toxic it is , '' he said `` The administration is down-playing the problem because it saves them money down the line . \nIt was the same at Ground Zero . '' \nEPA tests indicate that the combined effect of dispersants and crude oil are even more toxic than individually . \n`` There are dispersants being applied by aeroplane and by boat , and these people on the water are being sprayed over and over again , '' Subra said . \nFive offshore rigs have been shut down since the spill after workers fell ill . \nSeven workers on a boat trying to scrub the oil from Breton Sound were taken to hospital on Wednesday , complaining of burning eyes , headaches , nausea , dizziness and chest pains . \nFive were treated and released . \nAdministration officials suggested in a conference call with reporters that the workers could be suffering from sunstroke in the hot Louisiana temperatures . \nThey also said the workers recruited for the clean-up fishermen and shrimpers put out of work because of the spill had received training and wore protective gear . \nHowever , the protective clothing does not include respirators , which environmental activists say violates safety regulations for workers exposed to dangerous chemicals . \nNone of the workers pictured raking up oil from the beaches of Grand Isle Louisiana in photographs released by the Deepwater command center today was wearing a mask or respirator . \nA version appeared on p6 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 02.03 BST on Saturday 29 May 2010 The latest news and comment from our team of reporters , writers and editors in the US Auto update every minute On | Off stuartmillar159 : I stand corrected RT @flashboy : @stuartmillar159 NO STUART THAT IS WHAT RAIN ACTUALLY IS ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_guardian/rsd/bpoil_guardian__2010-05-28__378.rsd.txt"}

Warner , president of Warner Financial , Inc. in Bethesda , Md. , was online Friday , September 19 at 1 p.m. ET to discuss guidelines for how to handle your personal finances amidst the turmoil . \nDurham , N.C. : Hi . \nI 'm a bit confused about the security of my mutual funds and stocks I have with my investment bank -LRB- which is not one of the ones going under -- at least yet -RRB- . \nWhat happens to those funds and stocks if the bank goes under -LRB- none of the funds contain investments in the bank , and none of the stocks are stock in the bank itself -RRB- ? \nLaziness is working for me for once . \n: Several months ago , a generous relative gave me a large some of money and I never got around to putting into my Roth IRA which is very diversified . \nI figure now is a good time to invest . \nPotomac , Md. : Barbara , I 've been putting off getting a financial planner for years now , but after the recent market roller coaster , I feel that it 's finally time . \nHowever , I 've done little research into what characteristics and qualifications I should be looking for in a planner . \nCould you give me some insight this ? \nArlington , Va. : Barbara , I recently started a new job that matches the first 5 % of my deposits into my 401k . \nDoes that 5 % count against the federal limits -LRB- $ 15K , I believe -RRB- or do the limits only apply to what is actually taken out of my paycheck ? \nArlington , Va. : Barbara , I guess my question is : where is all of this bail-out money coming from ? \nAre we going to be hit with huge tax increases to fund them ? \nAustin , Texas : How much money should I have in cash ? \nWhere should I keep it ? \nBank or Money Market ? \nAlexandria , Va. : Barbara , I have my savings in a small bank in Michigan , where I am from . \nI 've always felt very secure keeping my funds there , but now I find myself wondering if it 's false security . \nIn general , what are the safest institutions for keeping savings ? \nAre smaller banks a bad bet ? \nMine has locations in three states , all in the Midwest . \nBut it 's not a national entity like Bank of America or anything like that . \nAm I being smart or stupid ?

\nMeaning , a friend told me if you make less than $ 800 a year you do n't have to report it to the IRS . \nAnything over $ 801 you have to report . \nBowie , Md. : I just found I 'm getting a raise that would put my income over the limit to make full-size -LRB- $ 5000 -RRB- Roth contribution for this year , which I 've already done . \nIf I increase my 401k withholdings , are those effectively deducted from modified AGI , to keep me below the threshhold ? \nAnonymous : I have a fair amount of money in mutual funds , but very little in individaul stocks , so I am not too worried about the latest downturns in the stock market , but the actual and possible demise of more banks makes me a bit nervous about bonds held with Citicorp and Wachovia . \nThe bonds do n't mature for several years . \nI would n't want to sell when the market is down , and doubt the banks will go belly-up , but , then people with Washington Mutual bonds probably said the same . \nI feel more confident about bonds I have with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae since they seem okay -- for now . \nPotomac , Md. : Hi , I would like to generate income from my investments and feel uncertain about where to put my money to obtain about a 5 % return , without little risk to principle and no lock-in rules that come with CDs . \nShort-term Treasury bonds seem to be doing the best right now . \nHow will these investments be impacted by the ongoing turmoil ? \nBethesda , Md. : Hi Barbara . \nI switched jobs this year and came away with a $ 23K pension pay-out that I need to roll over into something else . \nI am considering going with a fund from Northwest Mutual but I also currently have an account with T.

'' \nOn Wednesday , industry research firm Autodata reported that sales of cars and light trucks in September had declined 27 percent compared with a year earlier . \nSpeaking to reporters at the Paris auto show , Ford chief executive Alan Mulally said he believed the economic downturn would be `` deeper and longer '' than most people expected . \nHe predicted the global auto market might not rebound until 2010 . \nThe Commerce Department reported that orders for manufactured goods dipped 4 percent in August , the first decline after five consecutive monthly increases and the largest decline since October 2006 . \nAnalysts use the report to glean insight into how busy U.S. factories will be in coming months and into the demand for such goods as refrigerators , cars , cigarettes and clothing . \nThe report revealed weaknesses across the manufacturing sector . \nAircraft orders were down 38.1 percent , and orders from iron and steel mills were down 16.7 percent from the previous month . \nSemiconductor orders were down 17.1 percent , and household appliances were off 6.9 percent . \nThe decline in factory orders started before the implosion on Wall Street , which caused borrowing costs for many firms to skyrocket , a development expected to further slow manufacturing activity . \nAlso , with economies cooling in many parts of the world , demand for U.S. exports , which have been one of the strongest parts of the economy over the past year , is expected to weaken . \nThe economic slowdown will probably cause unemployment to spike . \nLast month , unemployment stood at 6.1 percent -- a five-year high -- but some analysts predict that it will reach 7 or 7.5 percent before the economy rebounds . \nAnd if the financial bailout package is defeated , the rate could go as high as 10 percent , Behravesh said . \nA Labor Department report released yesterday said the number of laid-off workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased to 497,000 last week , the highest level since just after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . \nLabor Department analysts said that the lingering impact of hurricanes Gustav and Ike raised that figure by about 45,000 . \nBut even factoring in those special circumstances , economists said the number of unemployment claims was in line with an economy in recession .

{"txt": "Robin Lustig | 12:14 UK time , Friday , 27 July 2012 The Battle of Aleppo seems to be shaping up into one of those key moments that could determine the outcome of what we can probably now call the Syrian civil war . \nIt is Syria 's second largest city and its commercial hub , classified by UNESCO as a world heritage site because of its priceless cultural and architectural treasures . \nUntil relatively recently , it had been able to stand aside from the turmoil that was tearing the rest of the country apart . \nA week after battles raged in parts of the capital , Damascus , now it 's Aleppo 's turn , as the rebels ratchet up the pressure in the apparent belief that their moment has come . \nSo where does that leave Syria 's neighbors , and where does it leave the rest of the world ? \nI was struck by a line in an impressively dispassionate report published by the defense policy think-tank the Royal United Services Institute : '' ... the question of some sort of Western intervention in Syria has shifted from a predilection to stay out of the conflict in any physical sense to an awareness that intervention is looking increasingly likely . \nWe are not moving towards intervention but intervention is certainly moving towards us . '' \nThe argument goes like this : increasingly foreign governments are worrying about what 's likely to happen when -LRB- not if -RRB- Bashar al-Assad is forced out . \nIn the words of RUSI 's director , Professor Michael Clarke : '' ... the regional implications of this dynamic of violence are more a driver of international diplomacy than the human misery inside Syria itself . '' \nSyria 's neighbor Lebanon is a tinderbox where just one spark can ignite a conflagration ; and Iraq and Iran , with their Shia majorities , are lined up against Turkey and Saudi Arabia , with their Sunni majorities . \nProfessor Clarke talks of an `` arc of proxy confrontation '' between Iran and Saudi Arabia , which could lead to all kinds of trouble . \nPerhaps the question should be not `` Will outside powers intervene in Syria ? '' \n, but `` Will they intervene more than they are already ? '' \nAs the RUSI report points out : '' Already , it is believed that western intelligence and special force operations are actively underway ... Western countries have backed the growing supply of arms , via Arab sources , to rebel forces for some months now ... Saudi Arabia and Qatar , with US and Turkish facilitation , have been arming and funding the opposition ; and this covert support has been substantially responsible for the progress opposition forces have made in recent weeks . '' \nOn the government side , the report says : `` Several Russian ships carrying a range of military equipment for the Assad regime are already at sea ... '' And the Iranians are unlikely to stand idly by if they see their strategic interests put at risk : in order to preserve their influence with Shia groups in Lebanon , for example : `` the Iranians would provide weapons , materiel and probably elements of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to support Assad , as they did successfully with the Shia militias in Iraq . '' \nNo one is suggesting that the West is likely to mount an Iraq-style international ground invasion , nor even a Libya-style air campaign . \nBut RUSI 's Jonathan Eyal has this stark warning : `` Western governments which have long worked for Assad 's departure should now begin to fear what may lie in store . \nFor , instead of imploding as other Arab countries did when they were gripped by revolutions , Syria will explode , disgorging its troubles across the entire Middle East , with potentially catastrophic consequences which will need to be managed , since they look unlikely to be avoided . '' \nAnd he makes this additional point : `` President Assad was -LRB- note the past tense -RRB- the region 's last secular strongman , the last of the Arab leaders who repressed religious and ethnic differences in the name of a higher pan-Arab ideology . \nHis method of government is now as defunct as that of the Soviet Union or communist Eastern Europe , on which it was based . '' \nUntil recently , the conventional wisdom was that international intervention in Syria simply was n't on the cards . \nIf the RUSI report is right , it may be time to rethink some of those assumptions : just watch the price of oil if tensions rise and Western governments start to panic at the thought of further price pressures as they struggle to save their faltering economies . \nAt 12:20 30th Jul 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : Frankly , I do n't know hat is going to happen in Syria and surrounding area , but a read a confirmation yesterday that US-NATO supported `` Free Syrian Army '' was defeated in Damascus . \nGovt is in full control of the nation 's capital and has declared this victory . \nIn Aleppo , Govt forces have regained control of most of the city with pockets of rebel fighters still active in the S.W.

Washington mutters not a word of criticism against them . \nPresident Barack Obama and his Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , say they want `` democracy '' in Syria . \nIs n't Qatar an autocracy ? \nIs n't Saudi Arabia among a pernicious caliphate dictatorship ? \nBut , they are also American puppets . \nSyria is unfortunately surrounded by US allies ; therefore , guns & foreign fighters pour into Syria . \nYet rebel-held areas of Syria exist only on rural borders of Turkey , Jordan , & Northern Lebanon - areas aligned to US . \nAt 12:41 30th Jul 2012 , BluesBerry wrote : Sure the so-called Free Syrian Army includes defectors from Syrian military . \nFrightened persons do frightening things . \nThese defectors may be betting that , in the long term , US will overthrow Syrian Govt . \nPivotal Q.

'' \nIs n't it about time we looked at our humanity more transparently in this world ? \nIs n't it outrageous to observe that humanity and human misery have become of lower grade compared to our international diplomacy and interests ? \nWhat may seem or feel like a game of chess to some parties is certainly a game of abuse , torture and dismembering to many innocent lives -LRB- slaughtered infants , children , women , men , and even cattle - and destroyed world heritage -RRB- ...

\nHow does it feel to belong to the same human race there ? \nDoes it ring any bells or raise any eyebrows ? \nThe citizens of the world need to beware of their responsibility in observing humanity not only upon their narrower apertures of interests in their local countries , but also across the wider world , where weaker and less-empowered civilians see nothing of their taken-for-granted access to human rights and dignity . \nIf people do n't put pressure on their governments and politicians , politics will always be what it has always been : a cold game of cold interests , stepping above any human aspect . \nI invite you to read the following blog , where some local Syrian academics , witnessing first-hand suffering on the ground in Syrian , from their positions amid young students and unfolding troubles on Syria ' streets , have posted a new article on the following log : It increases awareness of the daily inhumanity experiences by locals , to the international readership . \nMany observe that the Syrian suffering is slipping too easily -LRB- disgracefully -RRB- from the minds of their fellow citizens of the world . \nNews cover latest developments , but such experiences and logs are mind-openers , at the personal readership level , to how it is like to live in Syria today . \nThe academics contributing had to keep their full IDs anonymous for the safety of their relatives in Syria -LRB- the regime has been known for abusing or even killing people who may have a dissident cousin ! -RRB- \nI think of Hitler as a Snake Oil salesman -- with the product in 50 % alcohol . \nHe offered an instant cure -- but it was methanol and not ethanol . \nHowever that did not bother those Industrialists and Bankers who bought into the frachise The end of WWl brought the news of the usual suspects involvement -- Industrialists and Bankers -LRB- and often Monarchs -RRB- . \nUnfortunately for them also the founding of the Communist Russia . \n-- that by itself gave the remaining cannon fodder pause for thought -- not only in Germany , but also in far off places such as the UK . \nTrue , the WWl reparations was an extra problem for Germany -- and the depression tended to equalize some of the pain caused by the usual suspects The dangerous cry of workers unite swept through Europe -LRB- and to a lesser extent North America -RRB- . \n-- I , like you , do not see a straight line between the reparations and WWll and have long considered the argument as only a decoy -- away from a more sinister reality and truer history . \n-- One thing is clear , the Colonialists have left one heck of a mess in the region and now have the audacity to threaten -- if they reap what they have sown . \nAt 03:40 31st Jul 2012 , Arthur_Ritus wrote : Does anyone know the ethnic and\\/or religious make up of the many refugees who are reported as leaving Syria ?

orders SIX MONTHS AGO . \nAt 15:45 3rd Aug 2012 , smartsceptic wrote : Let us step back to the explosive events of 2011 when the `` Arab Spring '' was in its full blossoming mode . \nThe events beginning in Tunisia with the Jasmine revolution followed by the Benghazi uprising in Libya and of course the anti-Mubarak youth uprising in Egypt in January of 2011 . \nThe Libyan overthrow of Khaddafy was facilitated only with the military assistance of NATO 's NFZ intervention which then morphed into a full scale air support of the Benghazi rebels exceeding the mandate of UN resolution 1973 . \nIn Egypt , the youth rebellion in January 2011 , believed to be a purely indigenous movement , succeeded in a remarkable three week period in peacefully overthrowing Mubarak . \nBy staying out of active defense of Mubarak , the military -LRB- SCAF -RRB- may have provided the means by which the rebellion succeeded . \nOne of the best discussions of these explosive movements of the Arab spring that I have seen is the Youtube discussion -LRB- Webster Tarpley in Press TV debate with Libyan Rebel Supporters -RRB- held by pressTV . \nir , held on April 6 , 2011 with a youth panel in Beirut and experts in Philadelphia , London , and Washington . \nJournalist Webster Griffin Tarpley advanced the theory that much of the Arab spring movements were planned and executed behind the scenes from Washington except possibly for the purely indigenous uprising in Tunisia . \nThis theory opposed by the other experts , claims that the Egyptian uprising was orchestrated by a group called Otpor responsible for the Serbian overthrow of Slobodan Milosevich and for the many `` colored '' revolutions in Eastern Europe that followed . \nThe fact that social media -LRB- Facebook -RRB- played such an important role in organizing the interaction between Egyptian youth groups such as Kefaya and April 5th tends to reinforce Tarpley 's conspiracy theories . \nNow in the current Syrian insurgency which is much more complex than the previous uprisings we need to step back also and try todisentangle some of the threads of the current upsurge in fighting between the Assad government and the rebels . \nThere is evidence that the boldly successful assasination of Assad 's inner circle of security and military leaders was plotted and carried out by Saudi intelligence services under the direction of their newly appointed head Prince Bandar bin Sultan . \nIt is unlikely that the intricate operation could have been planned or carried out by the Syrian rebels who lack the sophisticated ability to penetrate the Syrian high command structure . \nThe little reported assasination of the deputy Saudi intelligence chief in Riyadh and the still possibility of the mortal wounding of Prince Bandar himself was carried out in retaliation by the Syrians has been unconfirmed thus far . \nOf course , despite the widely believed reports in Western media that the Assad government was in full retreat and facing disintegration in Damascus as a result of the wiping out of the security high command has since proven to be wildly premature as the Syrians were able to wipe out much of the resistance in Damascus in recent weeks . \nThe uprising in Aleppo itself though still strong also shows signs of weakening as the Syrian military pounds their strongholds with artillery and helicopter gunships . \nThe inability of the expat anti-Assad movement to coalesce around a common agenda for proceeding with the overthrow of Assad frustrates the outside powers who have organized numerous get togethers -LRB- Tunis , Istanbul , Paris -RRB- . \nThe presidential re-election campaign in full swing in the US which has an inhibiting effect on western intervention at this crucial time frustrates hawks such as former head of the State Department Policy Planning Office , AnneMarie Slaughter , who wrote a scathing , `` we will pay a high price if we do not arm Syria 's rebels '' , in August 1st edition of the Financial Times . \nThe USA has been plotting to overthrow Syria since 2001 . \nThe campaign reached a frenzied tempo about 16 months ago . \nThe UK government , as obedient poodle , has copied the US , even to the wording of policies and announcements . \nIt has been bitterly disappointing that BBC management has , for due consideration received , filtered and biased the news to present a false story of events in Syria . \nEven the BBC Trust has been given funds by the US State Department . \nThe British public deserves a chance to know the truth . \nAt the moment , this can best be approached through the Facebook Group `` The Syrian Revolution , the Untold Story '' . \nAt 05:51 10th Aug 2012 , smartsceptic wrote : In addition to the Syrian crisis , there are growing problems in Egypt and its fledgling democratic government of president Mohammad Morsi . \nThere is unrest in the Sinai desert where extreme poverty and a growing Islamic extremist movement prompted a military invasion this week . \nThe Sinai is important also of course because of its proximity to Israel which invaded the Sinai during the 1973 war . \nMorsi faces problems with consolidating his tenuous grip on Egyptian internal affairs with his uncertain relations with the military who resent any attempts to loosen their still strong grip over civil and economic control . \nRelations between the newly dominant position of the MB over Egyptian politics and the minority communities especially the Coptic Christians is also a potential threat to peace within Egypt . \nIt for this reason that I would advise President Obama not to get more deeply embroiled in the domestic affairs of Syria through deeper military involvement in their civil war . \nHe needs to stay flexible and retain the capability to influence events in the region by avoiding entanglements which jeopardize his future influence in the region after his re-election in November .

{"txt": "Representatives of BP , Transocean and Halliburton speak to senators Oil executives have traded blame in Congress over the Gulf Coast oil spill , as the battle to contain it continues . \nBritish oil giant BP told a Senate hearing a crucial safety device used by drilling contractor Transocean failed . \nSenators heard Transocean argue in turn that BP had been in charge and that a third firm , a BP contractor , did not plug the exploratory well properly . \nPresident Barack Obama was said by the White House to be `` deeply frustrated '' the oil leak had yet to be stopped . \nThe Obama administration has announced a break-up of the federal oil industry watchdog amid fears of a conflict of interest . \nThere 's been plenty of technical detail in Washington as three companies try to explain what went wrong ... In simple language it 's a blame game Eleven people died when an explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on 20 April . \nSome 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons -RRB- of oil a day have been gushing into the sea since then , threatening the delicate ecosystem of the US Gulf coast . \nSoldiers using helicopters and bulldozers , helped by prison inmates , are battling to contain the slick . \nBP 's efforts to cap the well were set back at the weekend when a giant metal funnel lowered over the site suffered a build-up of ice-like crystals and had to be put aside . \nBP hopes to make a second attempt this week to seal the well . \nThe oil giant 's latest plan is to ram rubbish such as golf balls and shredded tyres into the leak to block the hole , says BBC North America editor Mark Mardell . \nThe broken pipe is almost a mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- below the ocean 's surface , with little visibility for remote-controlled vehicles . \nA relief well is being drilled but may take up to three months to complete . \nIn Washington , BP , Transocean and a third firm , Halliburton , gave senators technical explanations of what went wrong . \nBut in simple language it was a blame game , our North America editor says . \nBooms have been partly successful although rough seas have washed oil over them Some controlled burning of oil has taken place , but it causes serious air pollution About 325,000 gallons of dispersant have been used , although scientists warn it may kill marine life A relief well is being drilled but could take many weeks A huge steel funnel suffered a build-up of ice-like crystals and had to be put aside Deepwater Horizon was owned and operated by Swiss-based Transocean , but was working on behalf of BP . \nLamar McKay , head of BP America , focused on a critical safety device , the 450-tonne blowout protector -LRB- BOP -RRB- . \nIt was supposed to shut off oil flow on the ocean floor in the event of a well blowout , but he said it had `` failed to operate '' . \nHe noted that BP had not owned the rig and so `` responsibility for the safety of drilling operations '' belonged to Transocean . \nBut Transocean chief executive Steven Newman said there was no reason to believe the BOP had been at fault . \n`` Offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , in this case BP , '' he said . \nHe also pinned blame on the failure of a cement oil-well casing built by BP contractor Halliburton . \nHowever , Halliburton executive Tim Probert argued his firm had followed all requirements set out by BP and industry practices . \nSenate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman said the oil rig explosion had probably been due to a `` cascade of errors , technical , human and regulatory '' . \nThe BBC 's North America editor says the details of the engineering may be obscure , but the motivation is clear enough : no-one wants to say the loss of lives , the environmental impact or the economic effect was their fault . \nAccepting blame will have huge financial consequences . \nAnd President Obama wants new laws to lift the cap on how much firms are liable to pay for such disasters from millions to billions of dollars - and that would apply to this accident , our North America editor adds . \nAnnouncing a shake-up at the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , Interior Secretary Salazar said it was important to build `` a strong and independent organization holding energy companies accountable '' . \n`` The tragedy aboard the Deepwater Horizon and the massive spill for which BP is responsible has made the importance and urgency of our reform agenda even clearer , '' he added . \nCritics say the MMS - a branch of Mr Salazar 's Department of the Interior - has been riddled with conflicts of interest . \nThey argue that the two core responsibilities of the MMS are diametrically opposed - making money off the industry by collecting royalties , while cracking down on it in ways that may affect the industry 's bottom line . \nA 2008 internal investigation found some MMS employees had taken drugs and had sex with energy company representatives . \nSome staff had also accepted gifts and free holidays amid `` a culture of ethical failure '' , according to the investigation . \nThe interior secretary has been conducting a 30-day review of offshore drilling at the request of President Obama .

{"txt": "A summary of events on Tuesday , May 25 , Day 34 of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that began with the April 20 explosion and fire on the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean Ltd. and leased by BP PLC , which is in charge of cleanup and containment . \nThe blast killed 11 workers . \nSince then , oil has been pouring into the Gulf from a blown-out undersea well at a rate of at least 210,000 gallons per day . \nBP is going in for the kill . \nThe trick is to do the job quickly and cleanly . \nAs early as dawn Wednesday , the oil company will try to choke the gusher at the bottom of the sea by force-feeding it heavy drilling mud and cement . \nThe tactic , called a `` top kill , '' is routinely used above ground but has never been tried 5,000 feet underwater . \nIf it 's not done just right , it could make the leak worse . \nBP CEO Tony Hayward pegged its chances of success in this case at 60 percent to 70 percent . \nEngineers were doing at least 12 hours of diagnostic tests Tuesday . \nThey planned to check five spots on the well 's crippled five-story blowout preventer to make sure it could withstand the heavy force of the mud . \nA weak spot in the device could blow under the pressure , causing a brand new leak . \nBob Bea , an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley , estimated that anything above 1.6 million gallons a day would be too much for a top kill to work . \nLive video of the leak has been available online for the past few days . \nRep. Edward J. Markey , D-Mass . \n, said he learned that it would be shut off while BP attempts the top kill . \nBut BP said late Tuesday that it has agreed at the request of the Obama administration to show video of the top kill . \nRecently , the video has shown the underwater plume getting significantly darker . \nA top oil engineering expert says that suggests heavier , more-polluting oil is spewing out . \nThe color of the oil gushing from the main pipe has changed in color from medium gray to black . \nTwo scientists noticed the change , which oil company BP downplayed as a natural fluctuation that is not likely permanent . \nIf the top kill does n't work , or makes the problem worse , BP will probably turn to a containment box resting on the seafloor . \nIt is a smaller version of the 100-ton box the company lowered several weeks ago in hopes of capturing much of the oil . \nThat larger device was clogged with ice crystals and BP had to abandon it , but the company hopes the smaller version might work better . \nBP says it siphoned more oil with a mile-long tube after two days of falling totals from a leaking seafloor well in the Gulf of Mexico . \nBP PLC spokesman John Curry told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the tube collected some 256,200 gallons of oil on Monday . \nThe collections were further evidence that a previous estimate -- that the entire spill was 210,000 gallons a day -- was too low . \nBP is complying with the government 's request to use less of a toxic dispersant in fighting the Gulf oil spill , but alternative dispersants are n't so readily available , the White House 's energy adviser said Tuesday . \nIn a letter to BP last week , the Environmental Protection Agency gave the oil giant three days to find a less toxic alternative to the dispersant , Corexit 9500 , that it is using to break up the oil . \nBut in a series of meetings that followed , White House energy adviser Carol Browner said , it became clear the alternatives were not as widely available as needed . \nStaff members at an agency that oversees offshore drilling accepted tickets to sports events , lunches and other gifts from oil and gas companies and used government computers to view pornography , according to an Interior Department report alleging a culture of cronyism between regulators and the industry . \nIn at least one case , an inspector for the Minerals Management Service admitted using crystal methamphetamine and said he might have been under the influence of the drug the next day at work , according to the report by the acting inspector general of the Interior Department . \nThe report cites a variety of violations of federal regulations and ethics rules at the agency 's Louisiana office . \nPrevious inspector general investigations have focused on inappropriate behavior by the royalty-collection staff in the agency 's Denver office . \nPresident Barack Obama , seeking to show command of a crisis that has exasperated the nation , will head back to Louisiana on Friday to review efforts to stop the disastrous Gulf oil spill . \nThe White House announced Obama 's trip but did not yet release details of exactly where he will go . \nThe president will be in Louisiana for the day on Friday , flying there from Chicago , where he will be spending the long holiday weekend , and returning there at night . \nEleven men who died in the offshore rig explosion that triggered the Gulf oil spill were honored at a somber memorial service with tributes from country music stars and drilling company executives . \nTransocean , owner of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , organized the event , held under tight security at the Jackson Convention Complex . \nIt was impossible to judge the reactions of those attending . \nReporters were n't allowed inside but were ushered to a room where the service was broadcast on closed-circuit television . \nThe Gulf of Mexico oil spill has constantly been measured against the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster , which leaked nearly 11 million gallons of crude , killed countless animals and tarnished the owner of the damaged tanker , Exxon . \nYet the leader of botched containment efforts in the critical hours after the tanker ran aground was n't Exxon Mobil Corp. . \nIt was BP PLC , the same firm now fighting to plug the Gulf leak . \nPeople who had a front row seat to the Alaska spill tell The Associated Press that BP 's actions in the Gulf suggest it has n't changed much at all . \nAs the thick oil from the BP spill bubbles through the Gulf of Mexico , threatening sea life and wetlands , foodies are taking up knife , fork and wine glass to defend the equally vulnerable reputation of the coast 's seafood industry . \nThe New Orleans Wine and Food Experience , an annual celebration of the city 's love of all things tasty , is pairing wines from around the world with the cooking of some of the city 's best chefs to help deliver the message : Louisiana seafood is still safe , available and delicious . \nFlorida tourism officials are taking to the airwaves to try and combat worries over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . \nThe Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association is running radio advertisements across the U.S. that say `` our coast is clean and our beaches are open . '' \nIt 's also running a full-page ad in USA Today with a similar message . \nThe Coast Guard says around 100 tar balls have been recovered throughout the Florida Keys in the last week , but none have been linked to the massive Gulf of Mexico spill . \nCapt. Pat DeQuattro said Tuesday an early analysis has been able to rule out that the tar balls came from the Deepwater Horizon spill . \nMore analysis is needed to determine where they did come from .

{"txt": "President Barack Obama said Friday that all options for responding to the crisis in Libya remain on the table , but he added that any military option means that `` you 've got to balance costs versus benefits , and I do n't take that decision lightly . '' \nObama told reporters the desired outcome would be for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to `` step down '' in the wake of civil war that has erupted in the North African country and Gadhafi 's military attacks on his own people . \nObama said the United States has already imposed sanctions on Gadhafi 's wife and some of his sons . \n`` All options are on the table , '' said Gadhafi . \nThe U.S. Treasury Department on Friday added nine more Libyans , including Gadhafi 's wife and several more of his children , to a list that freezes their assets in the United States and restricts their dealings with U.S. entities . \nGadhafi and some of his other sons already were on the list . \nAt a White House news conference , Obama outlined steps the United States has taken so far to pressure Gadhafi to step down , including the previously announced sanctions as well as talks with NATO allies on the possibility of establishing a no-fly zone over Libya . \nHe noted that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would meet with Libyan opposition figures in coming days during a trip to Egypt and Tunisia , and that his government has assigned `` a representative whose specific job is to interact with the opposition and determine ways that we can further help them . '' \nHowever , Libya 's former U.S. ambassador , who resigned last month in protest of Gadhafi 's violence against protesters , called Friday for the United States to recognize the newly created opposition National Transitional Council he now represents . \n`` We want recognition from all the rest of the world for this council , '' Ali Aujali told Libyan-American supporters and reporters . \nThe French government on Thursday recognized the opposition council as the sole representative of the country , and the British foreign secretary spoke to an opposition representative over the phone . \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel was more cautious , calling the Libyan council a possible interlocutor . \nClinton told a House committee Thursday that Washington was `` suspending '' its ties to the Libyan Embassy and reaching out to opposition leaders `` inside and outside of Libya . '' \nThe move effectively orders the embassy to close , though it stops short of breaking U.S.-Libyan diplomatic relations , a senior administration official told CNN . \nAujali abandoned Gadhafi last month , and the United States has not recognized his replacement , the official said . \nObama has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats for not ordering a no-fly zone over Libya or other steps intended to prevent Gadhafi from using military force against his own people . \nBoth Obama and Clinton have said any U.S. military involvement must be part of an international effort , preferably sanctioned by the United Nations and Arab governments . \nObama said Friday that NATO officials will meet next week to consider creating a no-fly zone over Libya . \nOn Thursday , White House National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon said the U.S. government planned to send `` purely humanitarian '' disaster relief teams into eastern Libya , where rebels battling Gadhafi were losing ground . \nThe U.S. Agency for International Development teams will be sent into monitor the delivery of humanitarian aid and should not be viewed as a military operation , he said .

{"txt": "U.S. Northeast digs out from blizzard , tornado strikes in South . \nFull Article France recalls Syria envoy , security HQ attacked AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - France recalled its ambassador to Damascus and Syria 's suspension from the Arab League took effect on Wednesday , intensifying diplomatic pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to halt a violent eight-month-old crackdown on protests . \nSyrian army defectors attacked an intelligence complex on the edge of Damascus in a high-profile assault that showed how close the popular uprising is to sliding into armed conflict . \nHours after the Arab League suspension took effect , Assad supporters threw stones and debris at the embassy of the United Arab Emirates and smeared its walls with graffiti , witnesses said . \nThe embassy is in one of the most secure districts of the capital , near Assad 's home and offices . \nForeign Minister Alain Juppe said France was working with the Arab League on a draft resolution at the United Nations . \nLast month Russia and China vetoed a Security Council resolution that would have condemned Damascus , but since then the normally cautious Arab League has suspended Syria for failing to implement an Arab peace plan . \n`` New violence is taking place and that has led to the closure of the missions in Aleppo and Latakia and to recall our ambassador to Paris , '' Juppe said , referring to weekend attacks by pro-Assad demonstrators on French diplomatic premises , as well as Turkish and Saudi missions , in Syria . \nArab foreign ministers met in Rabat for an Arab-Turkish forum , where a Syrian flag was placed by an empty chair . \nTurkey , now a fierce critic of its former ally , said Syria had failed to honor an Arab peace plan to halt the unrest . \nSpeaking through a translator , Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu compared Syria with Libya , where rebels captured , humiliated and killed Muammar Gaddafi last month . \n`` The regime should meet the demands of its people , '' he said . \n`` The collective massacres in Syria and ... the bloodshed can not continue like this . '' \nIn Tehran , Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi criticised the Arab League for `` acting in a way that will hurt the security of the region . '' \nHe told the official news agency IRNA that Syria , an ally of Iran since 1980 , had repeatedly pledged to meet legitimate popular demands and enact reforms . \n`` Unfortunately , some countries believe that they are outside the crisis ... but they are mistaken because if a crisis happens they will be entangled by its consequences . '' \nSaudi Arabia , which is eager to loosen the ties between its regional rival Iran and Syria , said the Arab League was acting in Syria 's interest , not interfering in its affairs . \n`` What 's important is not about suspending or not suspending -LRB- Syria from the League -RRB- , it 's stopping the bloodshed , starting the dialogue , and withdrawing troops from Syrian cities , '' Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal told Al Arabiya channel . \nWestern countries have tightened sanctions on Syria and on Monday Jordan 's King Abdullah became the first Arab head of state to urge Assad to quit after ensuring a smooth handover . \nIn the early months of the uprising , attempts by security forces to crush mainly peaceful protests accounted for most of the violence . \nBut since August there has been a growing number of reports of army defectors and armed civilians fighting back . \nActivists said Free Syrian Army fighters fired machineguns and rockets at a large Air Force Intelligence complex on the northern edge of the capital at about 2:30 a.m. -LRB- 0030 GMT -RRB- . \nA gunfight ensued and helicopters circled over the complex , on the Damascus-Aleppo highway . \nThere were no immediate reports of casualties . \nSyrian state media did not mention the attack . \nThe U.S. State Department said it had few details and no direct confirmation of the incident , but blamed Assad 's crackdown on protesters . \n`` It 's not surprising that we are now seeing this kind of violence , '' State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . \n`` We do n't condone it in any way , shape or form . \nBut let 's be very clear that it is the brutal tactics of Assad and his regime in dealing with what began as a non-violent movement is now taking Syria down a very dangerous path . '' \nA Western diplomat in Damascus described the assault as `` hugely symbolic and tactically new , '' saying that if the reported details were true it would be `` much much more coordinated than anything we have seen before . '' \n`` To actually attack a base like this is something else , and so close to Damascus as well , '' said the diplomat , adding that fighting in recent weeks involving army deserters in the town of Rastan and the city of Homs resembled a localized civil war . \n`` It 's not a nationwide civil war , but in very specific locations , it is looking like that , '' said the diplomat . \nThe Free Syrian Army was set up by deserters and is led by Colonel Riad al-Asaad , who is based in southern Turkey . \nIt announced this week that it had formed a `` temporary military council '' of nine defecting officers , led by Asaad . \nThe statement said the Syrian Free Army aimed to `` bring down the regime and protect citizens from the repression ... and prevent chaos as soon as the regime falls , '' adding that it would form a military court to try `` members of the regime who are proven to have been involved in killing operations . '' \nSyrian television showed thousands of Assad 's supporters rallying in Damascus and Latakia to mark the day his father Hafez al-Assad seized power in 1970 . \nIt said the crowds were also voicing their rejection of the Arab League 's decision . \n`` God , Syria , Bashar , that 's all ! '' \ndemonstrators shouted in central Damascus after turning out in heavy rain to wave flags and posters of the president . \nTwo large posters of Assad and his father hung from a building . \n`` Neither rain nor sanctions will stop us expressing our nationalism , '' they said , according to the television report . \nThe Arab League has stopped short of calling for Assad 's departure or proposing any Libya-style military intervention , but its ostracism of Syria is a blow to a country whose ruling Baath party puts Arab nationalism at the center of its credo . \nSyrian authorities have banned most independent media . \nThey blame the unrest on `` armed terrorist gangs '' and foreign-backed militants who they say have killed 1,100 soldiers and police . \nHundreds of people have been killed this month , one of the bloodiest periods of the revolt . \nSyria says it remains committed to the Arab peace plan , which calls for the withdrawal of troops from urban areas , the release of prisoners and a dialogue with the opposition . \nState media said more than 1,000 prisoners , including prominent dissident Kamal Labwani , were freed on Tuesday . \nBut human rights campaigners say tens of thousands have been detained since anti-Assad protests began . \n-LRB- Additional reporting Souhail Karam in Rabat , Dominic Evans in Beirut , John Irish in Paris , Mahmoud Habboush in Dubai and Ramin Mostafavi in Tehran ; Writing by Alistair Lyon ; Editing by Tim Pearce and Eric Walsh -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/syriancrisis_reuters/rsd/SyrianCrisis_reuters__2011-11-17__298.rsd.txt"}
{"txt": "Protesters in Egypt are responding in large part to a widening gap between rich and poor , one expert says . \nAnalyst : The protesters `` all want the same '' as they oppose growing inequality Analyst : `` There 's a feeling a lot of people are being left behind '' Differences involve government structure and population makeup -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Protesters who have taken to the streets in several Arab nations of North Africa are angry at their own governments , and lashing out over some specific problems in their countries . \nBut what they 're looking for -- and , in the end , what inspired them to stand up and demonstrate -- is very similar , experts on the region said Thursday . \n`` They all want the same , '' said Emile Hokayem , with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the Middle East . \n`` They 're all protesting about growing inequalities , they 're all protesting against growing nepotism . \nThe top of the pyramid was getting richer and richer . '' \nSpeaking to CNN about the recent demonstrations that have occurred , to varying extent , in Algeria , Egypt and Tunisia in northern Africa , and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula , Hokayem said the protesters were also standing up `` against a high level of police brutality . '' \n`` Fundamentally it 's a question of dignity . \nPeople 's dignity has been under assault for decades , '' he said . \nJuan Cole , a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan and a blogger , put it this way : `` There 's a feeling a lot of people are being left behind . '' \nThe protesters are driven by economic frustrations , `` discontent with authoritarian character of the regime , '' and the `` feeling that there 's no real representation '' -- although to different degrees in each nation , Cole said . \nAcross all four countries , the protest movements are `` largely driven by young people '' and include a `` high proportion of the educated middle class , '' he said . \nThere 's `` a feeling amongst that middle class that they 're not being given the opportunities in life that their degrees warrant -- what historians would call a ` blocked elite . ' '' \nThe worldwide economic crisis helped trigger the demonstrations by adding to economic pressures at home , and showing up in things like petroleum and food prices , Cole said . \nBut there are differences among the protest movements as well . \nIn Egypt , `` the state probably has done more to protect people '' from rising food prices by offering subsidies , Cole said . \nThe Egyptian economy was stagnant for decades , but in the past 10 years started to grow -- creating bigger differences between rich and poor , Cole said . \n`` And I think some of the protest is over the ways in which the labor movements have gotten left behind and have n't shared in the economic growth '' in that country , he said . \nEgypt cracks down on protesters Algerian forces clash with protesters In Algeria , where protests have been relatively small , the demonstrations `` look to me like an after-effect of the civil war that Algeria had between the fundamentalists and the secular generalists , '' Cole added . \nYemen has also faced great internal strife , which serves as a background to the wave of protests , he said . \nThe dire poverty in Yemen has also left questions about how many people have access to water , he said . \n`` It 's a deeply poverty-stricken country which is getting worse off . \n... People are desperate there . '' \nIn Tunisia , the government was run by an especially small clique , `` a kind of mafia state , '' which people are railing against , Cole said . \n`` The tightness of that clique and the way in which it dominated the economy is beyond anything you see elsewhere . \nPeople just were n't being let into the system to benefit . '' \nHokayem said that `` the key differences have to do with the makeup of these societies . '' \nFor example , `` Egypt is more diverse , a much bigger country , '' while Tunisia has a `` pretty homogeneous population . '' \nAlso , the military plays a different role in the different societies , he said . \nIn Tunisia , it is `` small and underfunded '' and not a major instrument of power , unlike in Egypt , where the military is a much bigger player , he said . \nBut while the context for each protest movement may be unique , `` at the end of the day , the real driver is psychology , '' Hokayem said . \nHe noted two more key similarities among the protest movements : `` The Islamists do n't seem to be on the forefront in any of those countries , '' he said . \n`` Up to now , it has been a mix of separate leftist and moderate Islamic movements . '' \nAnd unlike other protests seen in the Arab world in recent years , the protests are n't against the West -- nor do they seem inspired by the West . \n`` The West is irrelevant in a way , '' he said . \nGrievances at home `` are driving all of this .

{"txt": "It is not easy to divvy up $ 20 billion . \nPerhaps no one in America knows this better than Kenneth R. Feinberg . \nThe nation 's unofficial authority on disbursing massive relief funds oversaw the paying out of billions of dollars for families of those who died in the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks and the Virginia Tech shootings . \nHis phone rang once again this month , not long before word began to spread in Washington about such a fund for victims of the gulf oil spill . \nBP executives contacted Feinberg to see whether he would be willing to take the job . \nHe agreed , and President Obama signed on . \nThere is no blueprint for this kind of work , or at least there was n't until Feinberg and the small , loyal team that has worked with him for years created one in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks . \nAfter nearly a decade , they have gotten this difficult , contentious task down to something of a science . \nFeinberg flew to Mississippi and Louisiana on Friday to get started . \nHe began by surveying the mess and meeting with governors . \nOn Monday , he is scheduled to go to Houston to talk to BP executives . \nThe , and the Hokie Spirit Fund that compensated families of the victims of the 2007 mass shootings at Virginia Tech . \nObama also named him the `` newest pay czar '' overseeing executive actions \nTens of thousands more could come its way . \nBack in Washington , Feinberg 's team was busy setting the machinery of the fund in motion . \nA Washington lawyer in private practice , he has worked with the same three people for decades : His brother , David ; the firm 's longtime business manager , Camille Biros ; and his law partner , Michael Rozen . \nThey began arranging town hall meetings across the region , where frustrated people can vent their concerns and find out how to file claims . \nThey set up 800-numbers and readieda Web site . \nIn the coming weeks , they will hire scores of local lawyers , accountants , environmental experts and database engineers to staff community offices across five states . \nWith the Sept. 11 and Virginia Tech funds , Feinberg 's team worked for free . \nThis time , the operation will be funded by BP , and the company will pay the team a salary -LRB- it has not disclosed how much -RRB- . \nFeinberg , 64 , says his biggest obstacle will be earning the trust of a deeply suspicious population . \nSupremely confident and blunt-spoken in pinstripes and French cuffs , he is the picture of the Washington superlawyer -- albeit with an unmistakable Boston accent . \nBut he must convince beleaguered shrimpers and bait shop owners and marsh boat captains that he is not there to represent BP or the government . \nGetting them to quickly settle their claims through the escrow fund instead of suing BP is critical to the success of the compensation program . \n`` This program can not be run from Washington , D.C. , '' Feinberg said in a news conference Friday after a two-hour meeting in Jackson , Miss. , with Gov. Haley Barbour -LRB- R -RRB- . \n`` You have to come down here to the states affected by this spill and hear firsthand what 's being done , what needs to be done , to provide prompt , fair , impartial compensation for people with a legitimate claim . '' \n`` Do not assume that everybody 's going to file a claim that should file a claim , '' Feinberg warned . \n`` There are people in our country very skeptical of a program like this , worried about it . \n` It 's too complicated . ' \n` I 'm not sure what I have to submit . ' ' \nI do n't trust them . ' \n` I 'm worried . ' \n` I 'm frustrated . ' \n` I 'm angry . ' '' \nBarbour offered his help in introducing Feinberg , telling his state 's residents that the man from Washington was `` somebody that everybody can trust . '' \nObama and BP have given Feinberg carte blanche to establish an independent system to compensate those affected by the oil spill . \n`` It is my program , '' Feinberg said , noting that it has `` my imprimatur on it , not the administration or BP . '' \nFeinberg declined to comment for this article . \nOver the years , Feinberg has helped settle some of the nation 's most complicated legal disputes , including a class-action lawsuit by Vietnam veterans over the use of Agent Orange , the government 's Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund that distributed $ 7 billion to the 5,500 survivors and families of the dead , and the Hokie Spirit Fund that compensated families of the victims of the 2007 mass shootings at Virginia Tech . \nObama also named him the `` pay czar '' overseeing executive compensation under the government 's Troubled Assets Relief Program . \nEach time he and his team wade in , they must establish guidelines so that people understand how the money is being doled out . \nIt can be a touchy business ; inevitably there are those who believe they got too little and others got too much . \n`` You start thinking about how many different layers there are to this ; it 's a lot , '' said Rozen , Feinberg 's law partner . \n`` It 's the sheer enormity of all of this that cuts across so many different kinds of livelihoods , whether they be commercial fishermen or independent contractors or oil rig workers or tourist venues .

{"txt": "` My mission to help Haiti rebuild ' The BBC 's Emilio San Pedro is one of a team working on a new daily World Service radio broadcast to Haiti to keep survivors better informed and to help the island begin to recover from the catastrophe . \nFor me , the opportunity to throw myself into working on a program that was solely focused on helping Haiti was nothing short of an answered prayer . \nThat is because I have several special connections of my own with Haiti . \nI have many close friends from Haiti from the early part of my career in Miami . \nAnd Haiti was also the first country I traveled to as a young Cuban-American journalist on a foreign reporting trip in 1991 . \nThe first thing I had done that first night of the earthquake - before the idea of going to Miami to work on this program was even conceived - was pick up the phone and call the house in Miami of Marcus Garcia , a former Haitian colleague with whom I had traveled to Haiti on that first trip nearly 20 years ago . \nOne of my oldest friends told me she did not sleep for four days until she heard that her mother had survived Marcus , I was certain , would have lots of important news to share with me and would no doubt be able to help me understand the full scale of the disaster . \nHis son , Michel , answered the phone and I proceeded to introduce myself and say that , as he would imagine , I wanted information from Marcus on the earthquake . \nMichel sounded extremely upset . \nHe told me that , in fact , he was desperately trying to get hold of Marcus , who was in Haiti . \nHe said he could not get through and was agonising because he did not know what had happened to him , or his mother or any other family members . \nAt that point , something hit me , which remains with me to this day . \nThis disaster had touched every single Haitian inside or outside the country . \nEvery Haitian family has been affected by the disaster I felt horrible . \nA wave of sadness mixed with embarrassment consumed me as a journalist for having called at such a crucial time . \nI spoke to him on the phone and he told me that his parents had survived the devastating quake . \nBut his wife had died and their house , everything that was so dear to them , had been destroyed . \nA flood of images came to me of their beautiful and chaotic city , Port au Prince , which he and another Haitian colleague , Elsie , had introduced me to all those years ago - images that were buried somewhere in my memory . \nIn the two weeks that have followed , not a day has gone by that I have not heard about another friend whose relative - or entire family - has perished in the quake . \nI distinctly remember a few days ago , getting into the studio to talk down our digital line to Port au Prince to Mario Delatour , one of our new program 's correspondents . \nHe told me he actually lived in Washington . \nSo , was he in Port au Prince simply to cover the story , I asked ? \nNo , he replied . \nHe had had to return because his parents were killed in the quake . \nMillions of Haitians will have to try to rebuild their lives Many of the Haitians living here in Miami or elsewhere around the world have faced unimaginable agony in trying to get in touch to find out about their loved ones . \nOne of my oldest friends , Magi Damas , a Haitian-American filmmaker , told me on the phone from New York how she did not sleep for four days until she heard the news that her mother had indeed survived . \nOutside of Haiti , there are hundreds of thousands more like her . \nInside Haiti , there are millions who are trying to get on with their lives and find a way out and back from the devastation caused by the earthquake - not only in Port au Prince but to so many other cities in Haiti , like Leogane and Jacmel . \nOur program 's aim is to help the survivors cope , to learn to move on and to rebuild . \nI think the well known Haitian musician , Jan Sebon , put it best . \nHe was speaking on Connexion Haiti , in a regular segment we have on the program in which a musical artist dedicates one of their songs to the Haitian people listening back home . \nJan said that he believed the time for counting the dead had passed , as hard as it might be to accept . \nIt was now time to move on and to stop focusing on the destruction - as painful as it might be and to try to find a way to rebuild . \nIf , through our broadcasts , we can help contribute to making that transition towards rebuilding possible then I think we will have succeeded . \nConnexion Haiti is broadcast daily in the Creole language at 09:10 to 09:30 local time -LRB- 14:10 to 14:30 GMT -RRB- . \nHow to listen to : From Our Own Correspondent Radio 4 : Saturdays , 1130 .

{"txt": "NEW : Libyan official says four rockets struck Bab al-Aziziya Thursday morning Control of airport would be key to rebels seeking entry point for aid Spokesman says government forces are in control of Misrata 's airport and seaport Misrata has been engulfed in violence for weeks Benghazi , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four rockets struck the compound belonging to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi Thursday , a Libyan government official told CNN . \nAfter the blasts , which could be heard in the center of Tripoli , sirens blared and at least two emergency vehicles could be seen speeding toward the Bab al-Aziziya compound . \nIt was not immediately clear whether anyone was hurt . \nOn May 1 , the Libyan government said another attack on the same compound had killed Gadhafi 's son Saif al-Arab Gadhafi and three of the leader 's grandchildren . \nThursday 's strike came a day after spokesmen for the Libyan rebels sparred with a spokesman for the Libyan government over who was in control of the airport in the besieged city of Misrata . \nDuring the day , Shamsiddin Abdulmolah of the Transitional National Council said the airport , located in the southern part of the war-torn city , had fallen to `` revolutionaries '' after opposition fighters in nearby Zlaitin were able to join their counterparts in Misrata . \nDuring the night , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said government forces were in control of the airport and the seaport in Misrata . \nHe said rebel forces had been there `` for -LRB- a -RRB- short time , and left . '' \nBut a rebel spokesman in Misrata , who has asked to be identified solely as Mohamed , said late Wednesday night that the rebels had retained control of the airport and were also in control of a civil defense base beyond the airport . \nThe capture of the airport would be key for rebels fighting the forces of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi since it would provide an important entry point for humanitarian aid . \nTwo months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the Misrata port have prevented most aid ships from docking there , leaving the city `` at the forefront '' of U.N. humanitarian concerns , a top U.N. official told the Security Council this week . \nNATO warplanes and missiles have been pounding Gadhafi 's forces since March as Gadhafi 's troops try to quash a nearly 3-month-old revolt against his nearly 42 years of rule . \nIn Misrata , Abdulmolah said an unknown number of casualties occurred in the fighting . \nHe also reported that the oil-rich town of Jakharra , in the interior of the country , fell Tuesday night to opposition forces and that Gadhafi 's forces were surrounded in the oasis towns of Awjila and Jalu . \nThe NATO mission is intended to enforce a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for the protection of civilians . \nU.S. President Barack Obama and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen will meet at the White House on Friday to discuss the alliance 's role , the White House said Wednesday . \nNATO said Wednesday that vehicle and ammunition storage facilities , a surface-to-air missile launcher and an anti-aircraft gun had been hit in the Tripoli area . \nIt also said in a news release that ambulance storage facilities were struck in Mizdah and Qaryat . \nAs for Misrata , Marie Colvin , the Middle East correspondent for Britain 's Sunday Times , told CNN that rebel forces defending the city from government troops were making `` meter-by-meter '' gains despite heavy shelling and rocket attacks . \nUnits loyal to Gadhafi have been firing rockets and artillery shells into residential neighborhoods , leaving a nearby emergency room full of women , children and old men , she said . \n`` The rebels are very much trying , at a minimum , to push back Gadhafi 's lines so he simply ca n't do that , '' Colvin said Tuesday . \nAs for aid , a ship carrying supplies from the International Committee of the Red Cross docked Tuesday in Misrata , but the ongoing fighting had deterred captains of other ships from trying to enter the port , Colvin said . \nThe ICRC said the vessel was carrying medical supplies , spare parts to repair water and electrical supply systems and 8,000 jars of baby food . \nOn the front lines of the battle , bullets were whizzing past `` like very angry hornets , '' Colvin said . \nAt least 70 rebels have been wounded -- but they have held their line , `` and meter by meter were able to advance , '' she said . \n`` They 're defending their homes . \nThey 're defending their families , and they are not giving up an inch . \nThey are fighting , '' Colvin said . \nThe first shipment of nonlethal aid from the United States to the Libyan opposition arrived Tuesday in Benghazi , U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said . \nIt included more than 10,000 meals that are permissible under Islamic law . \nOther items en route from the U.S. Defense Department include medical supplies , tents , uniforms , boots and protective gear . \nAlmost 750,000 people have fled the country amid the fighting , and another 58,000 are displaced within Libya , Valerie Amos , the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs , told the Security Council Monday . \nAnother 5,000 are stranded at border crossings between Libya , Tunisia and Niger , Amos said . \nOthers have tried to flee by sea , but one such attempt appears to have ended in disaster for hundreds of refugees as their ship capsized off the capital , Tripoli . \nCNN 's Nima Elbagir contributed to this story .

{"txt": "WASHINGTON\\/VENICE , Louisiana | Sat May 22 , 2010 7:50 pm EDT WASHINGTON\\/VENICE , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - President Barack Obama on Saturday blamed the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill on `` a breakdown of responsibility '' at energy giant BP Plc as he unveiled a commission to investigate the disaster . \nObama , in his weekly radio and Internet address , also said offshore oil drilling could only go forward if there were assurances that such accidents would not happen again . \nWhile ramping up pressure on companies linked to the still uncapped spill -- BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd -- he said he would also hold Washington accountable for mending its ways . \nObama said the U.S. Coast Guard is working round the clock to clean up the spill , but said offshore oil drilling could only go forward if there were assurances that such accidents would not happen again . \n`` There was a breakdown of responsibility at BP , Halliburton and Transocean , '' Obama said . \n`` And we will continue to hold the relevant companies accountable not only for being forthcoming and transparent about the facts surrounding the leak , but for shutting it down , repairing the damage it does , and repaying Americans who 've suffered a financial loss , '' he said . \nA month after the well blowout and rig explosion that killed 11 workers , sheets of rust-colored heavy oil are clogging fragile marshlands on the fringes of the Mississippi Delta , damaging fishing grounds and wildlife . \nIn his executive order announcing former Democratic Senator Bob Graham and former Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly would co-chair the commission , Obama made his first reference to the possibility of a criminal probe . \n`` The commission shall ensure that it does not interfere with or disrupt any ongoing or anticipated civil or criminal investigation or law enforcement activities or any effort to recover response costs or damages arising out of the Deepwater Horizon explosion , fire and oil spill , '' the order stated . \nThe administration is keeping the pressure on BP on many fronts as it strives to show it is being resolute in the face of what many believe is already the worst U.S. oil spill , eclipsing the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska . \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency expressed frustration on Saturday when it released BP 's response to its directive on dispersants instructing the company to evaluate pre-approved dispersants for toxicity and effectiveness . \nIt accused BP and some of the manufacturers involved of withholding information by invoking business confidentiality . \n`` EPA continues to strongly urge these companies to voluntarily make this information public so Americans can get a full picture of the potential environmental impact of these alternative dispersants , '' it said . \nIt did not name the companies . \nIn its response released by the EPA , BP said Corexit , a dispersant manufactured by Nalco Holding Co that it has been using , was the only one immediately available in sufficient quantities to tackle the spill and `` remains the best option for subsea application . '' \nIt also said that `` within 28 days of application it does not persist in the environment '' and asked to discuss the situation with the Coast Guard and the EPA before they issue `` directives requiring a change in dispersant products . '' \nSome environmentalists worry the chemicals in dispersants may have a lasting harmful impact . \nEPA Administrator Lisa Jackson will return to the Gulf Coast on Sunday to monitor its response while Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar travels to the BP Command Center in Houston to get an update from the federal science team working on the problem . \nBP made no immediate comment on Obama 's suggestion that it was to blame for the deep-sea disaster . \nBut the company 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , said he welcomed the establishment of the commission and pledged to work with its co-chairmen . \n`` We share the goal of the president and the public to know what happened to cause this accident and what regulatory and industry changes are needed to help prevent something like this from happening again , '' Hayward said in a statement . \nBP on Friday revised downward an earlier estimate that one of its containment solutions , a 1-mile-long siphon tube inserted into the larger of two seabed leaks , was catching 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- of oil per day . \nBP captured 2,200 barrels in the 24 hours to midnight , according to the incident response team , the same figure it had for the previous 24-hour period . \n`` To me from the very beginning with BP it was nothing but public relations , '' said Roger Halphen , a south Louisiana school teacher who has worked both in the oil industry and as a commercial fisherman . \n`` It 's just a disaster . \nEverybody was sleeping on this and all of a sudden here it is , '' he said of oil fouling the coast . \nThe weather at least was cooperating . \n`` There 's very little chance of rain and plenty of visibility with low winds and fairly smooth seas , '' said Ken Graham , head of the National Weather Service office in New Orleans . \n`` For things they need to do out there , they 've got a pretty good window of opportunity . \nFavorable conditions are expected through the weekend , he said . \nHigh winds and rough seas can hinder efforts to burn off or skim oil from the surface . \nLouisiana authorities are desperate to start building sand levees to keep the spill from swamping their coast , but experts have serious doubts about the $ 350 million project . \nThe company 's next planned step is a `` top kill '' -- pumping heavy fluids and then cement into the gushing well to plug it . \nMany scientists dismiss an original 5,000 bpd estimate of the total leaking oil -- often defended by BP executives -- as ridiculously low and say it could be 70,000 barrels -LRB- 2.9 million gallons\\/11 million liters -RRB- per day or more . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThis is a CRIME AGAINST NATURE . \nDICK Cheney and George W Bush layed the foundation for this negligent lack of regulatory oversight that ALLOWED BP 's flagrant , nightmarish lack of safety precautions . \nTHEY ALL SHOULD SENT TO PRISON AND MADE TO PAY a full accounting and WE should try to STOP this criminal behavior towards our mother earth and use SMARTER ways for energy . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-05-22__2005.rsd.txt.app-auth-final"}

{"txt": "AMMAN | Fri Jun 10 , 2011 11:21 pm BST AMMAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Syrian helicopter gunships fired machineguns to disperse pro-democracy protests , witnesses said , in the first reported use of air power to quell unrest in Syria 's increasingly bloody three-month-old uprising . \nThe use of the aircraft came on a day of nationwide rallies against President Bashar al-Assad , as unrest showed no sign of abating despite the harsh crackdown by his authoritarian state . \nThe helicopters opened fire in a northwestern town after security forces on the ground killed five protesters , said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights . \n`` At least five helicopters flew over Maarat al-Numaan and began firing their machineguns to disperse the tens of thousands who marched in the protest , '' one witness said by telephone . \n`` People hid in fields , under bridges and in their houses , but the firing continued on the mostly empty streets for hours , '' said the witness , who gave his name as Nawaf . \nSyria 's state television , in contrast , blamed violence in the area on anti-government groups . \nIt made no mention of attack helicopters but said an ambulance helicopter had come under fire over Maarat from `` terrorist armed groups , '' injuring crew . \nBritain , France , Germany and Portugal have asked the U.N. Security Council to condemn Assad , though veto-wielding Russia has said it would oppose such a move . \nForeign Minister Walid al-Moualem wrote to the Security Council accusing the opposition of violence and sabotage , Al Arabiya television said . \nForeign governments were basing their views on `` inaccurate information , '' it said . \nState television said earlier well-armed `` terrorist groups '' had burnt police buildings and killed members of the security forces in Maarat al-Numaan , which lies 55 km -LRB- 35 miles -RRB- south of Syria 's second city Aleppo on the highway to Damascus . \nMoualem 's letter asked for U.N. help to combat `` extremism and terrorism . '' \nDamascus wanted dialogue with the opposition , the letter said . \n, Syrian authorities have banned most foreign correspondents from the country and have repeatedly tried to portray anti-government protesters as armed and violent . \n`` There were peaceful protests today -LRB- in Maarat -RRB- calling for freedom and for the downfall of the regime , '' one demonstrator said by phone . \n`` The security forces let us protest , but when they saw the size of the demonstration grow , they opened fire to disperse us . '' \n`` During the protest , two officers and three soldiers refused to open fire so we carried them on our shoulders . \nAfter that , we were surprised to see helicopters firing on us . '' \nThe northwest border area , like other protest hotspots , is prone to tension between majority Sunni Muslims and Assad 's Alawite sect , which dominates the Syrian power elite . \nThe violence may reflect splits within the security forces , whose commanders are mainly Alawite and conscripts Sunni . \nActivists said Syrian forces had shot dead at least 33 at rallies across the country after Friday prayers . \nA U.N. spokesman said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had been trying to call Assad all week but was told that the president was `` not available . '' \nThousands of civilians have fled from the northwestern border area into Turkey , fearing security forces ' revenge for incidents in which 120 troops were reported killed this week . \nLocal people said at least 15,000 troops along with some 40 tanks and troop carriers had deployed near Jisr al-Shughour . \n`` Jisr al-Shughour is practically empty . \nPeople were not going to sit and be slaughtered like lambs , '' said one refugee who crossed the border into Turkey . \nA 40-year-old from Jisr al-Shughour , with a bullet still in his thigh , also described mutiny in Syrian ranks . \n`` Some of the security forces defected and there were some in the army who refused the orders of their superiors , '' he said . \n`` They were firing on each other . '' \nHuman rights activists aired a YouTube video described as from a Lieutenant Colonel Hussein Armoush , saying he had defected with soldiers to `` join the ranks of the masses demanding freedom and democracy . '' \nA Turkish newspaper said Ankara was looking into creating a buffer zone along the border as a contingency if hundreds of thousands of Syrians are driven out . \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross urged Syria to allow its aid workers wider access to the civilian population , including the many believed wounded or detained . \nRights groups say over 1,100 civilians have been killed since March in the revolt to demand more political freedoms and an end to corruption and poverty . \n-LRB- Reporting by Alexandra Hudson , Ece Toksabay and Tulay Karadeniz in the Turkish border area and Mariam Karouny and Yara Bayoumy in Beirut ; writing by Andrew Roche ; editing by Peter Millership -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/syriancrisis_reuters/rsd/SyrianCrisis_reuters__2011-06-10__324.rsd.txt"}
{"txt": "` Crazy ' Iraqi spy was full of misinformation , says report Sunday 3 April 2005 02.26 BST An alcoholic cousin of an aide to Ahmed Chalabi has emerged as the key source in the US rationale for going to war in Iraq . \nAccording to a US presidential commission looking into pre-war intelligence failures , the basis for pivotal intelligence on Iraq 's alleged biological weapons programs and fleet of mobile labs was a spy described as ` crazy ' by his intelligence handlers and a ` congenital liar ' by his friends . \nThe defector , given the code-name Curveball by the CIA , has emerged as the central figure in the corruption of US intelligence estimates on Iraq . \nDespite considerable doubts over Curveball 's credibility , his claims were included in the administration 's case for war without caveat . \nAccording to the report , the failure of US spy agencies to scrutinise his claims are the ` primary reason ' that they ` fundamentally misjudged the status of Iraq 's -LRB- biological weapons -RRB- programs ' . \nThe catalogue of failures and the gullibility of US intelligence make for darkly comic reading , even by the standards of failure detailed in previous investigations . \nOf all the disproven pre-war weapons claims , from aluminium centrifuge tubes to yellow cake uranium from Niger , none points to greater levels of incompetence than those found within the misadventures of Curveball . \nThe Americans never had direct access to Curveball - he was controlled by the German intelligence services who passed his reports on to the Defense Intelligence Agency , the Pentagon 's spy agency . \nBetween January 2000 and September 2001 , Curveball offered 100 reports , among them the claims of mobile biological weapons labs that were central in the US evidence of an illicit weapons program , but subsequently turned out to be trucks equipped with machinery to make helium for weather balloons . \nThe commission concluded that Curveball 's information was worse than none at all . \n` Worse than having no human sources , ' it said , ` is being seduced by a human source who is telling lies . ' \nAlthough the defector has never been formally identified , it appears he was an Iraqi chemical engineer who defected after UN inspectors left the country in 1998 . \nIn the aftermath of the US-led invasion , Iraqis whom Curveball claimed were co-workers in Saddam 's alleged biological weapons program did not know who he was . \nHe claimed he 'd witnessed a deadly biological weapons accident when he was not even in Iraq when it was meant to have happened . \nAfter September 2001 , his claims were given greater credibility despite the fact that he was not in Iraq at the time he claimed to have taken part in illicit weapons work . \nHis information was central to an October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate that concluded Iraq ` has ' biological weapons , and was widely used by President Bush and Dick Cheney to make their case for war . \nIt now appears there were problems with Curveball from the start , but the intelligence community was willing to believe him ` because the tales he told were consistent with what they already believed . ' \nIn May 2000 doubts about his credibility surfaced when he was examined for signs that he had been exposed to biological agents . \nWhile the results were inconclusive , a US official was surprised to find Curveball had a hangover and said he ` might be an alcoholic . ' \nBy early 2001 , the Germans were having doubts of their own , telling the CIA their spy was ` out of control ' . \nBut warnings were dismissed . \nIntelligence analysts who voiced concern were ` forced to leave ' the unit mainly responsible for analyzing his claims , the commission found . \nAt every turn analysts were blocked by spy chiefs and their warning never passed on to policy-makers . \nThe commission 's report is unlikely to renew confidence in America 's intelligence network as it attempts to uncover evidence of WMDs in Iran and elsewhere . \nThe report concludes that US intelligence agencies remain poorly coordinated , have resisted reform and produce ` irrelevant ' work . \nDozens of insurgents attacked Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad yesterday , detonating two suicide car bombs and firing rocket-propelled grenades at US forces before the assault was repelled . \nAt least 20 US soldiers and 12 detainees were wounded in the fighting , which lasted around an hour .

{"txt": "During a presentation to the oil spill commission , the panel 's chief investigator said he agreed with 90 % of BP 's conclusions about the disaster . \nBut the panel 's preliminary report said some BP actions had led to extra risks . \nBP has been widely criticised since the 20 April blowout in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig killed 11 workers , polluted hundreds of miles of coast and led to the worst environmental disaster in US history . \nFred Bartlit challenged congressional claims during his presentation to the seven-member National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling , countering allegations that BP had made disastrous choices to save millions of dollars . \nWe see no instance where a decision-making person or group of people sat there aware of safety risks , aware of costs , and opted to give up safety for costs '' End Quote Fred Bartlit National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling Among the claims , Democrats Henry Waxman of California and Bart Stupak of Michigan sent a letter in June to then-BP chief executive Tony Hayward claiming the oil company had made multiple decisions because of economic reasons that `` increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure '' . \nCriticism of the disaster has sprung in part from decisions made over the design of the BP well , which used a single pipe , known as a `` long string '' , that ran from the sea floor to the bottom of the well . \nAmong the commission 's preliminary findings , released on Monday , was that there was `` no evidence at this time to suggest that there was a conscious decision to sacrifice safety concerns to save money '' . \n`` We see no instance where a decision-making person or group of people sat there aware of safety risks , aware of costs , and opted to give up safety for costs , '' Mr Bartlit said in his presentation . \nHe added : `` We do not say everything done was perfectly safe . \nWe 're saying that people have said people traded safety for dollars . \nWe studied the hell out of this . \nWe welcome anybody who gives us something we missed . '' \nBut Mr Bartlit did say BP had left some important information out of its investigation into the disaster , which unleashed more than 200m gallons -LRB- 757m litres -RRB- of crude oil into the Gulf . \nHe added that there were areas where the panel 's probe would conflict with BP 's findings . \nThe commission 's 13 key points focused on tests done to check the cement used in the well , decisions made by BP when plugging the well and the actions of those at the company in the hours before the disaster aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig . \nBP and Transocean treated negative pressure tests as a `` complete success '' , the report says , adding that laboratory data should have prompted a redesign of the cement slurry . \nOnce the crew on the rig recognized there was a problem , there were `` several options that might have prevented or delayed the explosion '' , another key point states . \nThe report goes on to say that BP incurred `` additional risk '' through certain procedures . \nDespite the critiques by the commission , some groups feel the investigators could have come down harder on the oil giant . \nDaniel Becnel , a Louisiana lawyer who is suing BP , said the new findings were `` absolutely absurd '' . \n`` They are pasting over because they know the government is going to be a defendant sooner or later in this litigation , '' Mr Becnel said . \nBilly Nungesser , the president of Plaquemines Parish in Louisiana , also challenged the panel 's findings . \n`` Why cut corners if it is not for money ? '' \nMonday 's presentation kicked off a two-day hearing that is due to include reaction from BP , Transocean and Halliburton , the contractor which did the cement job on the Macondo well . \nA final report from the panel is due by 11 January . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

{"txt": "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Nobody led . \nNot the president of the United States . \nNot the chief executive of BP . \nNot Congress , federal agencies or local elected officials . \nFrom its fiery beginning , the Gulf oil spill has stood as a concentrated reminder of why , over four decades , Americans have lost faith in nearly every national institution . \nLike Hurricane Katrina , a natural disaster that caused voters to question then-President George W. Bush 's credibility , the poisonous geyser at the Gulf 's floor threatens to undermine Barack Obama 's presidency . \nMore alarmingly , the spill exacerbates the worry that this nation founded on the principle of trust now faces a crisis of faith in its public and private institutions -- government and big business particularly . \n`` This spill , it 's another blow to the body politic , '' says John Baick , professor of history at Western New England College in Springfield , Mass. . \nIt is , he says , another excuse to be cynical and uninvolved -- `` exactly the opposite of what has always been the American zeitgeist , a sense that we , collectively and through our institutions , can be something greater than ourselves . '' \nIt 's hard to summon that rising-sun aspiration when the unemployment rate hovers near double digits . \nWhen wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continue unabated . \nWhen terrorists take aim from inside and outside U.S. borders . \nWhen the U.S. Treasury writes massive IOUs to China and public schools write off millions of poorly educated children . \nThen along comes the oil spill to remind people of why they do n't trust leaders -- and why so many Americans , looking for information and action , are turning instead to blogs , Twitter feeds and their friends . \nConsider this revealing scene : With reddish-brown oil globs washing ashore at Fort Morgan , Ala. , Faith Kaiser and Bertice McPherson decided to do what generations of Americans have done when government ca n't -- or wo n't -- tackle a big problem : They handled it themselves . \nBefore paid cleanup crews started work , the volunteers pulled on rubber gloves and picked up the gooey mess . \nAs they did so , Kaiser said this : `` Six months from now the government will lie to us and say everything is fine . '' \nAt the 1787 Constitutional Convention , Benjamin Franklin famously observed that he had been trying to determine throughout the debate whether a sun painted on George Washington 's chair was rising or setting . \n`` But now at length , '' he said , `` I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun . '' \nAnd with that , the Founders created a nation upon the fundamental principle of trust . \nThey had an untested belief in the ability of people to lead themselves -- to choose leaders from their own ranks and to hold those leaders accountable . \nEven our currency , once backed by the promise of precious metal , is today built upon a faith-based system called `` fiat '' -- a Latin term meaning `` let it be done . '' \nIn a dictatorship , people can lose faith in institutions and the apparatus of state can step in . \nBut democracy ca n't survive without faith in its institutions because the people , by definition , create and control them . \nWhile there were surely crises of faith during the Civil War , the Progressive Era and others times of tumult , the early 20th century was marked by a reflexive sense of trust in the nation 's institutions . \nEven as Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal vastly expanded the government safety net , a new breed of private charities and social reformers did n't bother waiting on government to help the poor , infirm and abused . \nBut things started to change in the mid-20th century , when polls showed a steady decline on the question of whether Americans trusted government in Washington to do what is right . \nFrom 1958 , when more than 70 percent said they trusted government most or all of the time , the trend line steadily drops until it hits the mid-20s in the post-Watergate era . \nThe trust line creeps up for a few years -- without getting nowhere near the 1958 mark -- and plunges again in 1994 , the year President Bill Clinton 's political faltering caused Democrats to lose control of Congress after more than 40 years in power . \nJust two months ago , a Pew Research Center poll showed that only 22 percent of the public say they can trust the government in Washington always or most of the time , among the lowest measures in a half a century . \n`` This spill has just got to make matters worse , '' said Pew pollster Andy Kohut . \n`` People are asking , Who 's in charge ? \nWhy ca n't they plug it ? \nWhat going on here ? '' \nJust 25 percent of the public has a favorable opinion of Congress . \nFavorability ratings also have fallen significantly for seven of 13 federal agencies included in the Pew survey , including the Environmental Protection Agency . \nFaith in institutions across the board has fallen since the 1970s , at least among the sample of institutions tracked by Gallup : churches , the U.S. Supreme Court , banks , public schools , newspapers , Congress and organized labor . \nOne of the least-trusted institutions is big business , no surprise after corporate wrongdoing and lax government oversight combined to help create the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . \nSixteen percent of Americans said they had a `` great deal '' or `` quite a lot '' of confidence in big corporations in 2009 , compared to 32 percent 30 years prior . \nThe only exception to this trend is the military , which has increased from a 54 percent favorability rating in the post-Vietnam era to 82 percent this year . \nPart of the problem : Americans today might expect too much of government and other institutions . \nTake the oil spill , for example . \nAccidents happen and , right or wrong , the government is not in the drilling or drill-capping business . \n`` I take responsibility . \nIt is my job to make sure that everything is done to shut this down , '' Barack Obama declared a few days ago . \nIn the same news conference , Obama also acknowledged his administration could have done better in dealing with the biggest oil spill in the nation 's history and misjudged the industry 's ability to cope with a worst-case scenario . \nIt was a new twist for the U.S. presidency , an office normally filled by men who accept responsibility or admit fault only grudgingly . \nObama may be recognizing that accountability breeds trust . \nLess than two years removed from an election victory built on his promise to fix Washington 's broken institutions , Obama now seems a captive of them . \nHis administration 's regulators cozied up to the oil industry before the spill and moved slowly afterward to seize control . \nThe president himself often seemed detached . \nWho else dropped the ball ? \n-- BP and its chief executive , Tony Hayward . \nAs his company 's oil filled up the Gulf , he had the audacity to complain that `` I 'd like my life back . '' \n-- The Minerals Management Service , the regulatory agency that failed to clean up its act despite Obama 's promise during the campaign to end the `` cozy relationship '' between the oil industry and federal regulators . \n-- Even the Coast Guard -- the one agency that survived Katrina with its image enhanced -- is now being criticized for its lack of transparency and command . \nAnd the public stews . \nListen to Billy Nugesser , president of the coastal Plaquemines Parish : `` We are dying a slow death here . '' \nThe public 's unconditional faith in national institutions is dying , too . \nWe ca n't buy a `` Shrek '' drinking glass at McDonald 's because it might be laced with cadmium . \nWe ca n't talk about the Catholic church without wondering whether something untoward might be afoot . \nWe ca n't watch a home run without wondering if our pro-ballplayer heroes are juiced . \nWhich may be why an umpire 's blown call denying a rookie pitcher a historic `` perfect game '' became a viral story this week . \nAmericans saw in the umpire 's apology and the pitcher 's gracious acceptance a sign that one of their institutions -- the made-by-America game of baseball -- still includes leaders who do the right thing even when the situation is less than perfect . \nFrom their government , Americans do n't expect perfection . \nBut the system requires that people at least have faith in their political leaders to be competent and accountable . \n`` If people do n't believe , if people do n't give , if people do n't trust , they will pick the politicians who are the loudest rather than the most sincere , '' said Baick , the history professor . \n`` They will pick the rabble rouser rather than the technocrat who gets things done .

'' \nThe BBC 's UN correspondent , Barbara Plett , says Russia will not support any measure that could mean regime change . \nMoscow was also concerned about a warning of further measures if Syria does not comply with the resolution , fearing that this could open the door to outside intervention , our correspondent says . \nRussia and China vetoed a previous draft resolution against Syria late last year . \nWestern nations have been hoping that Arab League support for this resolution will soften Russian resistance . \nThe current draft , presented to the council by Morocco , largely supports a plan outlined by the Arab League earlier this week calling for Mr Assad to hand authority to a deputy , who would form a national unity government with the opposition within two months . \nThe draft resolution calls for further measures if the Syrian government does not comply with the call for political transition . \nThe council will not vote on the resolution until next week . \n`` There is now a chance that the Security Council will finally take a clear stand on Syria . \nThat is long overdue , '' said German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle . \nThe French ambassador to the UN , Gerrard Araud described the situation in Syria as a major crisis . \n`` The country is sinking into civil war . \nWe are desperately looking for a political solution , '' he said . \n`` We have here the League of Arab States which is proposing a solution . \nSo our reaction is simply to support it , but again , there is nothing else .

{"txt": "Ian McEwan gives a global dimension to the details of a neurosurgeon 's day in Saturday , says Mark Lawson It 's odd now to think that Ian McEwan once lacked confidence as a novelist . \nHis first two attempts at the longer form - The Cement Garden and The Comfort of Strangers - felt like the work of a born short-story writer being stretched on a rack by his publisher and literary tradition , needing help from typeface and spacing to qualify even as novellas . \nBut with his last but one novel -LRB- Amsterdam -RRB- having won the Booker Prize and the last -LRB- Atonement -RRB- out-selling John Grisham and Tom Clancy in some weeks ' book charts , McEwan has the swagger - the literary equivalent of a tennis player in the first tournament after winning Wimbledon - of a novelist who could do almost anything . \nWhat he has done is Saturday , which resembles Amsterdam in sardonically examining the interior life of the contemporary middle classes but departs starkly from the century-long focus of Atonement by taking place over 24 hours , on what is supposed to be the day off of Henry Perowne , a noted London neurosurgeon . \nA recent edition of Granta carried an extract from Saturday , in which Perowne drives out of Oxford in the morning to visit his brain-hazed mother . \nI had assumed that this was the beginning of the novel but it turns out to be page 152 of a book of less than 300 pages . \nIt 's a measure of the level of incident in Henry 's day - and the meticulous close-stitching of McEwan 's work as a word-surgeon - that , before his Mercedes S500 reaches the Westway , en route to his mother , he has already witnessed a potential terrorist attack , discussed the Iraq war with his son , made love with his wife , come close to murder on a central London street , lost a game of squash and shopped for a fish stew . \nYet , while the novel is clearly an attempt to set down the textures of everyday life - close reading could improve your cooking , your squash game and even tip you off about what sort of kettle to buy - McEwan has larger concerns than , say , Nicholson Baker in the close auditing of The Mezzanine and Room Temperature . \nSaturday catalogues the local only in order to focus on the global . \nFor the day on which we take account of Henry is Saturday 15 February 2003 . \nAs the neuro-surgeon tries to mind his own business , hundreds of thousands of marchers are gathering in London to protest against Tony Blair 's support for the American attack on Iraq . \nAs the background tramping and shouting begins to intrude on the quiet order of Henry 's life , it becomes clear that , if Saturday were to have another eight-letter S-word as its title , it would be Security . \nBy recording with such loving care the elements of one rich Englishman 's life , Saturday explores the question of to what extent it is possible to insulate yourself against the world 's concerns . \nCentrally heated , pension-planned , air-bag protected , permanently loved and frequently fucked by his wife , healthy and even able to give health to others , Henry lives within a protective sac of satisfaction and achievement . \nBut , as Henry knows from his profession , such sacs are not always enough to protect against disastrous impact and , on this day of rest , he takes his hit . \nThe most recurrent theme in McEwan 's 10 novels is the sudden ambush of the safe and smug . \nGo shopping and you 'll never see your kid again -LRB- The Child in Time -RRB- . \nTake a hike and the hounds of hell are just around the corner -LRB- Black Dogs -RRB- . \nFall in love and the next thing you know you 're carving up a cadaver -LRB- The Innocent -RRB- . \nGo for a picnic and one man dies while a nutter claims you as his soul-mate -LRB- Enduring Love -RRB- . \nA similar external menace is pushing at Henry 's bubble . \nBetween his uxorious love-making and his squash game , he bumps into Baxter , an aggressive driver who believes that Henry should n't have been where he was . \nWe 'd think , colloquially , that Baxter needs his head seeing to and has a funny look . \nNeurosurgeon Perowne immediately understands the eruptions happening in the man 's skull . \nAs Saturday -LRB- like Enduring Love -RRB- is in part a story of suspense , a summary needs to be protective , but Baxter comes to challenge both the surgeon 's domestic instincts and his professional skills . \nBut Saturday , in common with Philip Roth 's The Plot Against America , is subtle enough to be taken as a warning against either intervention or against isolationism . \nIs the foreign policy of Henry 's government exposing him to danger , or is his moneyed , bouillabaisse-eating existence a self-delusion in a threatening world ? \nAs in the best political novels , the evidence and arguments are distributed with careful ambiguity . \nThe novel is inevitably and properly clearer about its position on another internal debate . \nPerowne , although an exemplar of the civilised upper middle classes , does n't believe in literature . \nHe has no time to read and even becomes confused when his daughter Daisy , about to have her first poems published by Faber & Faber , uses the tricky jargon word `` stanza '' . \nThe surgeon especially ca n't see the point of novels which tell you about someone 's life in great detail . \nSurely it 's quite easy to note these things down and then type them out . \nMcEwan gives Henry an even chance of victory on the squash court but , in this bit of sport about whether novels have a point , the novelist thrashes his hero in every line . \nIn giving his central character not only a poet daughter and a father-in-law who writes verse but a wife who works at a newspaper , the writer could be accused of locating the story on home turf . \nBut a considerable technical achievement of Saturday is that it succeeds in going inside the mind of a brain surgeon . \nIn the early stages , there is a certain nervousness about whether the author is simply transcribing research notes - `` Then he let Rodney take the lead in another burr hole for a chronic subdural '' - but , by the end , there is no doubt that Perowne has the hands , eyes and thoughts of a neurosurgeon rather than a novelist . \nMedical language , though , is only one of the registers in the prose . \nMcEwan is one of the least flashy stylists of his generation , less quotable than Martin Amis or Julian Barnes , but , especially in Atonement and now this book , his voice has settled into scrupulous , sensual rhythms in which even something as simple as a 24-hour news bulletin is subject to careful choices of adjective and noun : `` The synthesised bleeps , the sleepless anchor and his dependable jaw . '' \nIn a novel of great sureness at the level of both action and language , McEwan makes one curious choice : the quotations from Daisy Perowne 's debut volume of poetry are actually published lines by Craig Raine , giving the book an additional subplot in which , beyond the plot 's call on various sections of the Metropolitan police , you expect the literary cops to arrive and arrest Daisy for plagiarism . \nIt 's a matter of debate whether it 's the reader or the writer who is being too clever here . \nFor the rest of its length , though , Saturday gives no sense of McEwan 's talent taking a day off . \nThe only consolation for McEwan 's contemporaries , I suppose , is that they could taunt him that he ca n't seem to write short stories any more . \nMark Lawson 's Enough is Enough : Or the Emergency Government will be published by Picador later this year .

'' \nThe region , where four protesters have been killed by security forces since Friday , has seen the first non-sectarian protests against the Baath Party since Assad 's late father Hafez al-Assad crushed leftist and Islamist opponents in the 1980s . \nAmong them were the cream of Syrian society -- lawyer and former judge Haitham al-Maleh , leftist leader Riad al-Turk , writer Akram al-Bunni , and poet Mohammad al-Maghout , who wrote that being tortured by a compatriot was more painful and humiliating than repression under French colonialism . \nThe violent campaign by the Syrian authorities in the 1980s left up to 70,000 people missing . \nIn 2004 , Kurds , many of whom are denied Syrian citizenship , mounted violent demonstrations against the government in which 30 people were killed . \nIn a sign of changing times , Montaha al-Atrash , whose father led a revolt against French rule in the 1920s , addressed Assad directly in an interview on BBC Television . \n`` Dr Bashar , listen to us . \nNon-stop pressure and repression will generate an explosion . \nYou know , and you see how the region is boiling , '' said Atrash , referring to a wave of Arab uprisings which have toppled two leaders and challenged many more . \n`` The regime is still responding to anyone calling for change by trying to portray it as a scheme for sectarian strife and division , and by unleashing on demonstrators security forces who are already filling the streets , '' she added , speaking in Syria . \nThe protesters have not called for the removal of Assad , and Atrash said there was no hatred against the president , an ophthalmologist by training who was thrust into politics when his elder brother Bassel died in car accident in 1994 . \nBut the name of one top figure of the ruling elite , Assad 's cousin Rami Makhlouf , is being uttered publicly . \nOwner of Syria 's largest cellphone company and several large businesses , Makhlouf is under U.S. sanctions for what Washington regards as public corruption . \nUntil now , no one inside Syria has dared question his activities . \nThe tycoon maintains his businesses are legitimate , providing professional employment for thousands of Syrians . \n`` Go away Makhlouf . \nWe do n't want thieves ... There is no more fear after today , '' is one of the main chants of demonstrators who burned premises of Makhlouf 's Syriatel company . \nResidents of Deraa city , where the demonstrations started on Friday , say they have shaken off humiliation and decades of repression , and broken a ` fear factor ' that had made people suspicious that even close relatives might be informants . \n`` I can now smell freedom , '' said one youth , describing how mass demonstrations had helped unify a tribal-based society he said authorities had played a part in fracturing . \nEven if protests subside -- the south was calm on Tuesday morning -- Syrians say the grievances which sparked them remain . \nOpposition figure Riad al-Turk , who spent 25 years as a political prisoner including almost 18 years alone in a 2-meter by 2-meter underground cell during Hafez al-Assad 's rule , said Syrian leaders face `` the moment of truth .

'' \nAnd a third man , who wanted to be identified only as Abdsalam , said the port was heavily bombarded . \nElectricity is out in nearly the entire city , and food and fresh water are running scarce , he said . \n`` They are using every every possible type of weapon , '' he said . \nThe U.S. State Department said the airstrike killed Saif al-Arab al-Gadhafi 's son and three of his grandchildren . \nThe Libyan government identified the children as Saif al-Arab 's sons Gartaj Hannibal Muammar al-Gadhafi , age 3 , and 2-year-old Saif Mohammad al-Gadhafi , as well as Mastoura Hamid Abuzitaia , the daughter of the leader 's daughter Aysha . \nState TV aired video of two bodies , wrapped in white shrouds and draped with flags , one of which was reported to be the body of Gadhafi 's son . \nA funeral procession and burial for the fallen `` martyrs '' will be held on Monday , state TV said . \nThe Libyan leader and his wife were in the house when it was targeted , but they are in good health , government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told journalists . \nThe building was in a residential area of Tripoli that houses several embassies . \nIbrahim called the bombing a `` war crime . '' \nThe strike destroyed the two-bedroom , single-story house , leaving a massive crater in its place . \nCNN could not independently confirm the reports , and NATO said in a statement Sunday that the alliance was `` aware of unconfirmed media reports that some of Gadhafi 's family members may have been killed . '' \n`` We regret all loss of life , especially the innocent civilians being harmed as a result of this ongoing conflict , '' said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard , commander of NATO 's military operations . \nHowever , Bouchard said , all targets `` are military in nature and have been clearly linked to the Gadhafi regime 's systemic attacks on the Libyan population ... We do not target individuals . '' \nBut U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham , a leading supporter of the Libya campaign , called the elder Gadhafi a `` murderer '' and `` a legitimate military target . '' \n`` He 's not the legitimate leader of Libya , and the way to get this to end is to go after the people around him and his support system , '' Graham told `` Fox News Sunday . '' \nThe South Carolina Republican is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee . \nIn Benghazi , a hub for rebel forces and their transitional government , the news triggered celebratory gunfire even as a rebel spokesman dismissed the reported death as `` a desperate attempt to get sympathy . '' \n`` In all honesty , we never heard of Saif al-Arab until the start of the uprising , '' said Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of the Transitional National Council in Benghazi , on Sunday . \n`` We do n't believe this is true ... This regime constantly lies and keeps lying , '' he added . \nOpposition members , citing witness reports , also warned that pro-Gadhafi troops in the town of Zintan , 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- west of Misrata , and other nearby areas have been equipped with gas masks . \nThe opposition figures say that suggests the government forces are preparing to use chemical weapons against rebel forces -- but the accounts lacked detail , and CNN could not independently confirm the reports . \nIbrahim dismissed the allegations as `` all lies . '' \n`` Every time they come with a lie , they jump out to the next lie , '' he said . \n`` The media can not report from one side of reports . \nIt is the same lie when they said we are using cluster bombs . '' \nHuman Rights Watch reported in mid-April that pro-Gadhafi troops were firing cluster munitions into Misrata and displayed a portion of a Spanish-made mortar shell that releases 21 smaller bombs across a wide area . \nThe Libyan government denies the allegation . \nFighting also intensified Sunday near the rebel-held Djerba border crossing into Tunisia , witnesses and Tunisia 's state news agency reported . \nThe TAP news agency said the flow of refugees out of Libya had slowed , possibly as a result . \nNATO began bombarding Libya on March 19 , after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians demanding the end of Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . \nThe alliance said it targeted a `` command-and-control building '' in Tripoli on Saturday , as well as hit seven ammunition depots around the capital . \nAccording to a NATO military official , the airstrike that Libya says killed Gadhafi 's son involved four precision-targeted bombs , one of which failed to detonate . \nThe official , who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter , said the alliance was certain the target was a command-and-control facility and said the building hit , although above ground , had reinforced portions . \nThe official said NATO had `` no evidence '' that Gadhafi 's relatives had been killed . \nA photograph of the site showed the unexploded bomb , a 2,000-pound weapon designed to penetrate reinforced concrete , but NATO would not confirm what other types of ordnance may have been dropped . \nNor would it disclose which nation 's aircraft carried out the strike , or what type of aircraft were used . \nLibyan officials attacked the U.S. Embassy compound in Tripoli Sunday , as well as the British , French and Italian missions , according to a senior U.S. official in Washington . \nAll four NATO nations are taking part in the airstrikes . \nMark Toner , a U.S. State Department spokesman , said he had seen reports of violence against the diplomatic facilities and that if true , `` we condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms . '' \nItalian officials told CNN that the embassy of Qatar , a Gulf Arab state that supports the campaign and is supplying arms to the rebels , was also targeted . \nThe senior U.S. official said Turkey , the protecting power for U.S. interests in Libya , is trying to keep an eye on the American compound -- but `` there is n't much they can do when you have an organized mob , as this appeared to be . '' \nIn London , British Foreign Secretary William Hague expelled Libya 's ambassador to the United Kingdom after the attacks . \nHague said the Tripoli government is breaching its international obligation to protect diplomatic missions by allowing the vandalism . \n`` The attacks against diplomatic missions will not weaken our resolve to protect the civilian population in Libya , '' Hague said . \nIbrahim told CNN the attacks happened because `` the people were upset '' and that Libyan security forces stopped the attacks and prevented the embassies from being destroyed . \n`` There are embassies that have not been touched , '' he said . \nLibyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said later the government deeply regrets the looting and violence at the embassies . \nAngry crowds simply overwhelmed police , he said . \nIn addition , 12 U.N. international staffers left Tripoli because of the unrest and are in Tunisia , the world body said Sunday . \nSpokeswoman Eri Kaneko said the United Nations would not identify the staffers or their agencies for safety reasons . \nU.N. national staffers are still in the country and international staffers remain in Benghazi . \nCNN 's Frederik Pleitgen , Richard Roth , Barbara Starr , Elise Labott , Richard Allen Greene and Holly Yan contributed to this report .

{"txt": "The battle over the constitution is regarded by most Iraqi women , confined to their homes by the occupation , as an irrelevance Wednesday 17 August 2005 01.15 BST A prominent group of Iraqi women who backed the US-British invasion recently met the American ambassador in an effort to pressure the politicians drawing up Iraq 's constitution not to limit women 's rights . \nWestern feminist groups and some Iraqi women activists fear that Islamic law , if enshrined as a main source of legislation , will be used to restrict their rights , particularly in relation to marriage , divorce and inheritance . \nThe US claims to share this concern . \nIraqi women generally do not . \nTo understand why , perhaps we need to remember that this constitution is being written in a war zone , in a country on the verge of a civil war . \nThis process is designed not to represent the Iraqi people 's need for a constitution but to comply with an imposed timetable aimed at legitimising the occupation . \nThe drafting process has increasingly proved a dividing , rather than a unifying , process . \nUnder Saddam Hussein , we had a constitution described as `` progressive and secular '' . \nIt did not stop him violating human rights , women 's included . \nThe same is happening now . \nThe militias of the parties heading the interim government are involved in daily violations of Iraqis ' human rights , women 's in particular , with the US-led occupation 's blessing . \nWill the new constitution put an end to this violence ? \nMost Iraqi women try to cope sensitively with the predicament of dealing with the occupation and the rise of reactionary practices affecting their rights and way of life . \nThis applies across the political and class spectrum , to the secular left as much as to moderate Islamists and nationalists . \nMost also feel that the constitution is not their priority , and that those writing such a crucial document should be able to think clearly , to think of tomorrow . \nTo do that one must be free of today 's fears and able to enjoy basic human rights , such as walking safely in the streets . \nIraqi women can not . \nDespite all the rhetoric of `` building a new democracy '' , Iraqis are buckling under the burdens and abuse of the US-led occupation and its local Iraqi sub-contractors . \nDaily life for most Iraqis is still a struggle for survival . \nHuman rights under occupation have proved , like weapons of mass destruction , to be a mirage . \nTorture and ill-treatment - even the torture of children in adult facilities - is widespread . \nDepleted uranium and other banned weapons have been used against Iraqi cities by occupying troops . \nIraqi women were long the most liberated in the Middle East . \nOccupation has largely confined them to their homes . \nA typical Iraqi woman 's day begins with the struggle to get the basics : electricity , petrol or a cylinder of gas , water , food and medication . \nIt ends with a sigh of relief at surviving death threats and violent attacks . \nFor most women , simply to venture on to the street is to risk being attacked or kidnapped for profit or revenge . \nYoung girls are sold to neighbouring countries for prostitution . \nIn a land awash with oil , 16 million Iraqis rely on monthly food rations for survival . \nNone has been received since May . \nPrivatisation threatens free public services . \nAcute malnutrition among children has doubled . \nUnemployment , at 70 % , has fuelled poverty , prostitution , backstreet abortions and honor killings . \nCorruption and nepotism are rampant in the interim government . \nGender is no obstacle : Layla Abdul-Latif , the minister of transport in Ayad Allawi 's administration , is under investigation for corruption . \nA quota system imposed by Paul Bremer , the former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority , ensures women 's participation in the interim government , the national assembly and the committee appointed to write the constitution . \nIraqi women 's historical struggle against colonial domination , and for national unity , social justice and legal equality , has been reduced to bickering among a handful of `` women leaders '' over nominal political posts . \nPowerless , holed up in guarded areas , venturing out in daylight only with armed escorts , and lacking any credibility among Iraqi women , the failure of these `` leaders '' is catastrophic . \nLike their male colleagues , they have adopted a selective , largely US-oriented approach to human rights . \nThe suffering of their sisters in cities showered with napalm , phosphorus and cluster bombs by US jets , the death of an estimated 100,000 Iraqis -LRB- half of them women and children -RRB- , is met with rhetoric about training women for leadership and democracy . \nDocuments released in March by the American Civil Liberties Union highlight more than a dozen cases of rape and abuse of female detainees , and reveal that no action was taken against any soldier or civilian official as a result - and that US troops have destroyed evidence , to avoid a repetition of last year 's Abu Ghraib scandal . \nThe silence of female National Assembly members and interim-government and US-financed women 's NGOs is deafening . \nIn Iraq , `` women 's rights '' is an absurd discourse chewing on meaningless words . \nNo wonder that the US-funded NGOs , which preach western-style women 's rights and democracy , are regarded as vehicles for foreign manipulation and are despised and boycotted , even when they recruit liberal or left personalities . \nIraqi women know that the enemy is not Islam . \nThere is a strong antipathy to anyone trying to conscript women 's issues to the racist `` war on terror '' targeted against the Muslim world . \nMost Iraqi women do not regard traditional society , exemplified by the neighborhood and extended family , however restrictive at times , as the enemy . \nIn fact , it has in practice been the protector of women and children , of their physical safety and welfare , despite lowest-common-denominator demands on dress and personal conduct . \nThe enemy is the collapse of the state and civil society . \nAnd the culprit is the foreign military invasion and occupation . \nHaifa Zangana is an Iraqi-born novelist and former prisoner of Saddam 's regime ; a version of this article appeared in the Cairo weekly Al-Ahram Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian .

{"txt": "SANAA\\/DAMASCUS | Mon Mar 21 , 2011 3:56 pm EDT SANAA\\/DAMASCUS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Popular unrest swelled into a crisis for one Arab autocrat and began to rattle another long seen as immune on Monday as leading figures parted ways with Yemen 's president and street protests spread in Syria . \nTop generals , ambassadors and some tribes endorsed the goals of Yemen 's anti-government protesters in a glancing blow to President Ali Abdullah Saleh as he strove to withstand demands for his resignation after 32 years in power . \nSaleh , an important U.S. and Saudi ally in the world 's paramount oil-exporting region , has survived a civil war , tribal revolts and al Qaeda militant campaigns so far . \nHowever , the defections of major officials appeared to pose the gravest threat yet to his tenure , although some important military allies remained loyal . ' \nThe three-month-old tide of revolt against Arab rulers seen as repressive , corrupt and unaccountable for unemployment and poverty reached Syria on Friday and gained momentum on Monday as rallies for `` freedom '' spread in the south . \nSaleh 's government has been in power since Hafez al-Assad took power in 1982 . \nHis Baath Party has dominated Syria since 1963 . \nIn Libya , where peaceful protests grew into insurrection within weeks , Muammar Gaddafi 's forces besieged the only major rebel city in the west and brought in human shields , residents of Misrata said , to ward off further Western air strikes meant to protect civilians . \nThe first French and British sorties , backed by U.S. missile salvoes , at the weekend halted the Gaddafi forces ' advance on the rebels ' eastern power base of Benghazi and pounded Libyan air defenses to enforce a U.N.-declared no-fly zone . \nAs Western forces prepared to shift from air strikes to air patrols , there was no sign of any gains on the ground by the loosely organized , poorly trained insurgents . \nNevertheless , a senior official with the rebel National Council , based in Benghazi , said the rebels aimed to capture the capital Tripoli and drive out Gaddafi . \nHe welcomed the no-fly zone but again said no foreign ground forces were wanted . \nInternational divisions over intervention in Libya flared into the open on Monday as leaders in Russia and China criticized the air strike policy which neither approved in the U.N. Security Council vote last week . \nRussian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin compared the air strikes to `` medieval crusades , '' eliciting a rare rebuke from his protege , President Dmitry Medvedev , while China 's official media accused countries involved of inviting new upheaval in the Middle East . \nTurkey and Germany , both members of NATO , voiced further doubt and the Arab League was also divided . \nBAHRAIN SAYS FOREIGN PLOT FOILED In Bahrain , where the absolute Sunni Muslim monarchy has been grappling with a restive Shi'ite majority , said a foreign plot against the Gulf island state had been thwarted . \nThe head of the Gulf Cooperation Council said interference in Gulf state affairs by Iran , the Shi'ite giant across the water from Bahrain , would not be tolerated . \nConfrontation between Bahraini Sunnis and Shi'ites calling for democracy has whipped up international tension in the region . \nAbout 1,000 Saudi soldiers and 500 police officers from the United Arab Emirates entered Bahrain last week to safeguard government facilities . \nKuwaiti naval vessels arrived in Bahrain on Monday to help protect its waters as part of a Gulf defense pact , Bahrain 's state news agency said . \nBahrain is the base for the U.S. Fifth Fleet , central to Washington 's military power in the oil-rich region . \nFrance became the first Western power on Monday to call publicly for Yemen 's Saleh to stand down . \nPan-Arab TV channel Al Arabiya quoted Saleh as saying most Yemenis were with him and he would remain steadfast . \nA government official said the president had asked Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal to mediate in the crisis . \nDefense Minister Mohammad Nasser Ali said the army still backed Saleh , setting the stage for a possible standoff with those commanders who threw in their lot with tens of thousands of protesters who have taken to the street for weeks . \nThe latest defections seemed to be sparked by Yemen 's bloody response to protests on Friday , when plainclothes snipers killed 52 protesters in Sanaa , prompting Saleh to sack his cabinet and declare a 30-day state of emergency . \nIn Syria , hundreds of people demonstrated against the government in the southern town of Jassem , activists said , but authorities did not use force to quell the latest protest . \n`` This is peaceful , peaceful . \nGod , Syria , freedom ! '' \nchanted the protesters in Jassem , an agricultural town near Deraa . \nSyrian Justice Minister Mohamad Ahmad Younis went to Deraa to try to calm emotions and open a dialogue with protesters . \nThe authorities appeared to adopt less heavy-handed tactics , opting not to intervene against protests demanding freedom and an end to graft and repression , but not the overthrow of Assad . \nThe Baath Party has banned opposition and enforced emergency laws since seizing power in a coup 48 years ago . \nThe Pentagon said on Monday Libya air strikes had hamstrung Gaddafi 's might but signaled that the United States would keep the rebels at arm 's length to avoid getting mired in a messy civil conflict amid war weariness over Afghanistan and Iraq . \nGeneral Carter Ham , U.S. commander leading a multinational coalition against Gaddafi , said three days of air and missile strikes had fashioned a broad no-fly zone but Western forces were not providing close air support for Libyan insurgents . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThat is beginning to look mighty fishy ... Just one paragraph on that , hmmm ... . \nSeem a tad -LRB- a bit , ya think ? -RRB- \nSeems like any possible change in sea state in Bahrain is having oil poured in the waters to calm the waves ...

{"txt": "BP survival fears as predicted cost of oil spill soars Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster could end up finishing off the British oil giant Monday 14 June 2010 21.52 BST The board of BP have been meeting to discuss whether to suspend payment of this year 's dividend to shareholders . \nPhotograph : Christopher Furlong\\/Getty Images The Gulf of Mexico disaster was always going to hit BP in the pocket . \nBut as the costs of the spill keep rising , it could end up finishing off the British oil giant . \nUntil now , the City has fretted over the fate of BP 's dividend , supposed to be $ 10bn , due this year . \nTony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , has stuck to the line that the company is able to meet all its obligations to its shareholders and to the clean-up effort . \nEven last week , the question had been not whether BP had deep enough pockets to keep making the dividend payouts , but whether it could afford to politically . \nBut as the size and scope of BP 's liabilities grow with each passing the day , it is now no longer a question of whether BP can or should pay its dividend . \nIt is increasingly whether it can survive . \nOn Sunday , 54 Democratic senators demanded that BP pay $ 20bn into a ring-fenced account to make sure it met all its obligations for the clean-up and damages . \nThe figure stunned the company , which backs most analysts ' estimates that these costs are likely to be nearer to $ 5bn . \nThe point is , unlike with the financial crisis two years ago , there is not going to be a bail-out for BP . \nAs Barack Obama has made clear , US taxpayers will not pay for the clean-up or compensation . \nFund managers are already speculating that BP could attempt to draw a line under its liabilities by hiving off its US business in an attempt to save the rest of the group . \nYesterday , the US investment bank Citigroup even published research in response to `` inquiries from clients '' over how plausible such a restructuring would be . \nThe note concludes that it would not be easy , and BP insists that it is not planning such a move anyway . \nBut the fear that the company may cut and run whether justified or not goes some way to explaining the demand that it deposits such a large amount into a ring-fenced account . \nThe thing is , no one not BP , not the US senators knows how much this will end up costing the company . \nThe fishing industry in the Gulf brings in $ 660m revenue each year . \nThis pales into insignificance compared to the $ 65bn-a-year tourist industry in Florida , which has already been hit as oil pollutes its beaches , leaving them deserted . \nTourism and fishing could suffer for years . \nBP says nothing has changed to justify a $ 20bn bill , but this is disingenuous . \nIn less than a month , the size of the size has gone from 5,000 barrels per day to between 20,000 and 40,000 barrels . \nIf BP estimated that the clean-up and damages would cost around $ 5bn , but the size of the spill has at least quadrupled , then the $ 20bn demanded by the US senators does not look unreasonable . \nThis $ 20bn does not include civil penalties , where BP is liable for up to $ 4,300 for every barrel spilt if it is found to have acted negligently . \nIf 40,000 barrels per day keeps flowing until August , when a relief well is hopefully completed plugging the leak for good , and BP does not improve on its current collection rate , this could add a further $ 14bn to the bill . \nIn some respects , the estimates by senators , analysts and BP are irrelevant . \nLike the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , the US and BP are in unchartered territory . \nAs Hayward recently remarked , the US is a world-leader in pursuing damages . \nBut it is not in Obama 's interests for the company to go bust ; he will want it to remain a cash cow not for its shareholders , but to make good the damage which has been done however much or however long it takes .

{"txt": "Dean Wright is Global Editor , Ethics , Innovation and News Standards . \nAny opinions are his own . \nThere s nothing like a disease outbreak to highlight the value of the media in alerting and informing the public in the face of an emergency . \nThere s also nothing like it to bring out some of our more excessive behavior , essentially shouting Run for your lives ! \n-LRB- but , whatever you do , stay tuned , keep reading the website and do n't forget to buy the paper ! -RRB- . \nAn outbreak of a form of influenza , which was known as swine flu before the World Health Organization changed the name , has killed scores in Mexico and infected others in the United States , Canada , Europe and New Zealand . \nIt 's already having an effect on markets and travel plans , in addition to the obvious impact on public health . \nThe impact on markets could become more significant in time , but the impact on the media was practically immediate . \nCable television programmers went into crisis mode and a look at newspaper front pages and website home pages around the world showed a range of responses , from the almost hysterical to the concerned and more measured . \nIn the New York Daily News : SWINE FLU SPREADS ! \n-LRB- though it was played below a sports story on the New York Yankees losing to the Boston Red Sox -RRB- . \nIn the New York Post : HOG WILD ! \n-LRB- also playing second to the Yankees ' humiliation , but illustrated with a pig sucking on a thermometer -RRB- . \nIn The Japan Times -LRB- using a Reuters story -RRB- : `` Swine flu in Mexico sparks global panic '' In the South China Morning Post -LRB- which certainly has experience in covering bird flu and SARS -RRB- : Asia on high alert for swine flu as airports step up checks . \n-LRB- a reference to the SARS outbreak -RRB- . \nIn the Toronto Sun : `` CALM URGED AS FLU FEARS GROW . '' \nLater Monday , after the European Union health commissioner advised Europeans to postpone nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico , The New York Times led its website with Europe Warned on U.S. Travel , with a deck reflecting transatlantic disagreement , Flu Advisory Unwarranted , C.D.C. Says . \nThe BBC website focused on the confirmation of flu cases in the UK , with extensive Q&A 's on the origins of the disease and how it spreads and contributions from readers who were dealing with disease -LRB- some of them medical professionals in Mexico -RRB- . \nBig , bad-news stories can mean surges in audiences for media outlets and they certainly raise the adrenalin level of editors and reporters . \nThey offer the temptation to go to excess , but they also offer the opportunity for us be of priceless service to our customers , clients and readers . \nThe question for me is how we in the media make sure we report accurately and informatively on the story and its impact on the markets and consumers lives without minimizing and without sensationalizing it . \n`` This is the type of story where our goal to stay factual and keep perspective is essential to uphold , '' says Reuters Editor-in-Chief David Schlesinger . \n`` Our role is neither to trivialize nor to hype or scaremonger , but to describe accurately what is happening and put its implications in context . '' \nReuters has focused a great deal of resources rightly , given our customers and audience on the implications for the markets and the impact on the global economic downturn . \nOn Monday afternoon , Reuters.com was leading with Will global recovery catch the flu ? \natop a package of stories on possible market scenarios , the EU travel warning and factboxes on health precautions and industries being affected . \nOne story noted , not surprisingly , that travel and tourism stocks were in turmoil . \nReuters.com also featured a special coverage page with the latest news , accompanied by a sober presentation of `` Swine Flu Facts . '' \nThere 's even an invitation to receive updates on Twitter . \nCall me a skeptic on Twitter , but 140 characters wo n't do much to add context to the story . \nStill , no one ever said Twitter was about context and at least you can follow developments , whether or not you 're near a computer . \nMy Reuters colleagues especially the ones working bravely and tirelessly in Mexico are succeeding in upholding the goal of staying factual and keeping events in perspective . \nIt 's our mission to provide the information and insight our audience and customers need to make intelligent decisions about their investments and their lives . \nAs shown by the World Health Organization 's decision Monday to raise the pandemic alert to Level 4 , and later to Level 5 , there 's plenty of drama to report without adding to it . \nThe flu story is still in its early stages and it remains to be seen if this becomes one of the biggest stories of our time . \nWhatever happens , it wo n't hurt us all to take a deep breath now . \nThe CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -LRB- CMA -RRB- made a rather stark and dismal prediction in August of 2008 . \nAnd , the strange thing is ; there were no images of PERSONS , constantly appearing on the Main Stream Media -LRB- MSM -RRB- news papers , websites , and of course in High Definition on digital TVs wearing surgical or chemical masks -LRB- respirators -RRB- . \nThe World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- had nothing much to say about this drastic prediction which the CMA had made . \nThe CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION -LRB- CDC -RRB- in the UNITED STATES , also did not appear too concerned , especially given their close proximity to the geographic landmass known as Canada . \nThe basis for my assumption , leading me to believe that neither of these CORPORATE organizations had attached much or any concern , actually became somewhat obvious . \nBy this I make reference ; there was an imminent predicted demise of thousands , or perhaps hundreds of thousands of human beings , but yet , it was business as usual . \nYou could have hopped on a jet plane and fly to Mexico , drive across the North American borders to do some shopping , no problemo ... no alert measures went into effect , i.e. , like the WHO is doing now , e.g. `` Alert 5 ? \nor , as the UNITED STATES HOMELAND SECURITY might soon do , with their trendy color system , e.g. `` Amber Alert . '' \nWell , I ve rambled on long enough now , so I ll come to my point : In August 2008 , the CMA claimed that up to 21,000 Canadians will die this year -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , due to air pollution , and with 3,000 of those deaths due to short-term exposure to smog . \nI don t know of any pharmaceutical research CORPORATIONS that are currently trying to develop a VACCINE for air pollution or SMOG . \nSo , perhaps a flu pandemic might actually be a good thing ... being locked down in our homes , and or detained in FEMA detention camps , will definitely be pay back to the industry , which ultimately must bear the responsibility for the deaths of 21,000 human beings . \nLast reported , Mexico was losing $ 53 million dollars per day , because of the flu . \nGreat to read a balance . \nI am in Mexico right now , been here some time . \nI am shocked at the BS media hype coming out in my country back home ... causing a panic . \nThe main misleading statement is saying there are 150 dead without backing this up with the facts . \nThe facts are only eight people have been officially confirmed deaths from the virus and these cases my not be directly from the virus . \nThey also forget to mention the thousands who die of the flu and complications each year . \ne.g. about 100 a day in the USA alone . \nI think it is shameful they way the media is hypering this up and misleading the public . \nAnd the terrible impact on the country of Mexico . \nMexico is a great place to live and retire , rated number one by the organization International living two years running . \nThis is an alarm that world has to wake up . \nThis is an obvious that world is going to loose so many billion people this year as the testimony was said by so many christian server begining of this year . \nwell we are not that far before the government can step in and stop the big tragedy As serious as a pandemic can be , the Spanish Flu of the early 20th century is a prime example , things can get out of hand . \nRemember that swine flu has been with us before . \nIn 1976 it was detected on a US military base . \nThere seems to have been some deaths , and then the subsequent over reaction in vaccinating millions of Americans . \nThe vaccine proved to be more deadly -LRB- many people got serious , long lasting side effects -RRB- than the virus itself . \nThat being said , it would be a mistake to try to label this `` The Mexican Flu '' just as it is misleading to name the 1918 pandemic `` The Spanish Flu '' as it actually originated in the US . \nNo one is sure where the new N1H1 strain originated , but it has been here before , and some think that this might have even been the very same virus from 1918 . \nMedicine has come a long way , in 1918 there were n't even antibiotics readily available . \nAs to why many people are dying in Mexico City , -LRB- 150 out of 22 million is a strange thing to call many -RRB- it is the most populated city in the world with high poverty -LRB- difficult to get treatment if you have no insurance or money -RRB- . \nI also read that many in Mexico are having a difficult time getting the two viral drugs available to combat N1H1 . \nRelax , be extra cautious and clean , and make sure you eat well . \nGod Bless A nice lttle site to save you surfing the web about swine flu . \nevery media outlet will exaggerate in order to secure more audience for ad sales , and every government will exaggerate to have a handy excuse to assume ` special powers ' -- like they just did in Mexico . \nAt this rate , I imagine the TSA here in the States will be taking throat cultures before they let you board a plane . \nTake disease outbreaks seriously -- sure . \nYou would n't want to be the government that did nothing until it was too late . \nBut to scare half my neighbors into stocking up on surgical masks and half the third world into slaughtering all their pigs ? \nIn a week , I expect to hear about the sanitation crisis resulting from all those carcasses -RRB- . \nThere is a middle ground between blind panic and sleepy complacency . \nWe used to be able to count on the news to help us find it . \nI think it 's an outrage the hype this story is getting . \nThe news media just does n't have enough to say to be on air 24\\/7 . \nThis is more irresponsible than their usual panic though . \nSchools have closed , the stock market has been affected -- people are so frightened . \nAnd , for what -- So far , one person has died of this strain of flu -- whereas , in a normal outbreak , thousands die routinely from flu . \nI live in Mexico , close to the Belizean border . \nIt astounds me how everyone has over reacted to this . \nI know it could be serious , and I do n't want to minimize any possible danger but it is frightening to see an entire country completely shut down . \nMy workers are frightened and the information coming from all countries is so confusing . \nIf you go to the CDC and WHO websites and get real information , it is far less serious than is being hyped . \nI 'm a citizen of the US but I 'm ashamed at the misinformation and superiority that I feel coming from my own country . \nI think Mexico has done a brave thing in shutting down the country . \nWould any other country do this with 20 confirmed deaths ? \nI do n't think so . \nSomeone out there owes Mexico some Kudos . \nHas anyone found out if the HIN1 strain in Mexico is fatal or is it that the patients were not given the adequate antiviral medication on time ? \nExample a healthy 29 yrs Mexican died after 9 days . \nHowever all the cases outside Mexico have recovered -LRB- except for the Mexican baby in Taxes -RRB- . \nIs this a case of mistreatment or the strain being more virulent and deadly ? \nI think this article needs to be circulated around Reuters . \nWhen I first entered the site here , the top story was `` Mild Pandemic or Millions Dead ? '' \nPhrases like `` millions dead '' may grab attention , but they 're exactly the kind of sensationalism Mr. Wright 's article was warning against . \n`` Which common household product can cause sudden death in toddlers ? \nTune in at 11:00 pm for this and more ! '' \nThe Hype has really been irritating me . \nThe only positive point is that headlines seem to have temporarily stopped switching eight times a day between slight global recovery and deepening global meltdown . \nI was getting dizzy ! \nThe best thing about the swine flu craze is the short-selling potential of all these stocks that will soon deflate whenever the flu fears subside or their vaccines prove impractical . \nThis was in direct reference to the inefficient detection and timely dissemination of information , regarding the current emerging Swine Flu pandemic ... the World Health Organization along with the CENTERS for DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION -LRB- CDC -RRB- has paled in comparison to a two year old Seattle , Washington based company with just 50 employees VERATECT CORPORATION . \nThey alerted the public to a growing number of swine flu cases , weeks before the CDC and the WHO did . \nVERATECT accomplishes their daily business activities , via the use of computer algorithms , and human analysts , to monitor online and off-line sources , for hints of disease outbreaks , and worldwide civil unrest . \nPerhaps the CDC , the WHO , HHS , DHS , NSA , CSIS , RCMP and , even MI5 , could learn a thing or two from this start up company from Seattle . \nThey could perhaps partner with them , or other such CORPORATIONS , in an effort to satisfy the needs of certain public and private institutions . \nClients of these geek computer algorithms , and human analysis , were actually forewarned of the potentially severe outbreak of Swine Flu , and much sooner than the general public was too , apparently . \nThis new and growing business , which others are into as well , garners its source materials from data being captured from the likes of ; bloggers , on-line chatters , twitters , news media sources , and of course , government websites . \nThere is really nothing stopping the CDC , the WHO , et . \nal. , from using this available data to enhance the speed at which they respond to outbreaks of Swine Flu , H5N1 , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -LRB- SARS -RRB- etc. . \nWith the likes of this high tech , alerting technology , the possibilities will now be limitless . \nHad this method of prediction been available many years ago , the incidences of fatally injurious accidents to unsuspecting citizens , might have been minimized . \nIn particular , the Swine Flu vaccination program of the 1970s , which was responsible for horrendous side-effects such as , paralysis and death , comes to mind . \nNot to mention the on-going controversy of the Polio vaccines , especially with the recent negative publicity from Nigeria , and other third world countries . \nIt has been stated ; some of the obvious and important benefits of this intelligence gathering science , apart from possibly saving human life will better manage the financial reporting , and insurance coverage mitigating potential class action lawsuits due to negligence especially important in the UNITED KINGDOM , where the government recently crafted the CORPORATE Manslaughter , and CORPORATE Homicide ACTs . \nWith this cutting edge into the future knowledge , 21,000 Canadians might have had sooner awareness that they would die in 2008 from air pollution and smog Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ? \nWORLD VISION INCORPORATED pays good money for this unique style of pre emptive intelligence . \nIt is said , that they can actually use the alerting technology to determine where contaminated drinking water might exists , on this planet . \nThe leader of the CDC 's international swine flu team thinks this type of technology is somewhat useful and , sensitive to emerging threats . \nHowever , Dr. Scott Dowell also thinks it generates a lot of noise . '' \nOn the subject of noise or sound , the CORPORATION which truly possessed the widest vision capabilities ; was PANASONIC . \nMore than two months ago now , and before any inkling of Swine Flu -LRB- A-H1N1 -RRB- , this company came up with the perplexing plan ; repatriate the families of overseas employees , out of fears of an imminent flu pandemic . \nA PANASONIC spokesperson said ; employees will stay put , but families of those working in China , Asia -LRB- excluding Singapore -RRB- , the Middle East , Africa , Russia and South America are to return to Japan . \nSo perplexing was this decision , that it triggered a reaction from WHO spokesperson , Gregory Hartl : There 's really no reason for anyone to all of a sudden take such actions , because today is no different from yesterday . '' \nHartl of the WHO said ; there is no justification for this decision , particularly from a public health perspective . \nThere is no sense that the risk has risen , and we are definitely still in Phase 3 . \nPhase 6 = Condition Pandemic . \nIt 's all hype to focus attention elsewhere away from what our elected officials are doing . \nRe : Posted by Jason-May 1st , 2009 -- 4:59 pm GMT I agree with you : We all need to keep focused on what our elected OFFICALS are doing . \nAnd , perhaps equally , if not more important jason ; some of the things which they have , already done . \nThe hype seems to be an effective way of distracting people from the government 's antics and also to keep our minds off the economy crisis . \nI do n't know for sure how big this swine flu epidemic will get but at the moment , I think it 's all hype . \nSo today Mexico reports that the worst of the swine flu is over ; and it is no worse than a regular flu . \nHow much money was spent on this ? \nDid Obama not asked for a billion dollars , and asked companies to give as much time as the employees asked ? \nHow much did this cost to airlines , travel agencies ? \nHow much did this cost to the Mexican and world economy ? \nI think the news media need to do some real soul searching . \nHype sells but it will eventually backfire . \nI have a consipiracy theory , this could have been made to create terror among humanity . \nsome makers of medicine & vaccine and genius in developing diseases may have created the H1N1 for profit & commercial purpose . \nYes , I make it a point to read all comments on the blog . \nI like for the discussion to be largely among readers , since I 've already had my say -- and at some length . \nHowever , when appropriate I will wade back in to the debate . \nHey Raul from May 4th , 2009 -- Re : I have a conspiracy theory . \nI can surely agree with your written expression , but only positively on one point -- It is a conspiracy . \nAnd , these situations are no longer theories . \nYouTube this : Luke Rudkowski -- ` U.S. media does n't want truth ' . \nJust imagine how many people caught TB or AIDS everyday by global statistics and WHO should have declared world pandemic for every known communicatable disease , you will feel much better for a curable flu . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nHe writes a regular column and works with Editor in Chief David Schlesinger in maintaining the editorial relationship with the Reuters trustees and upholding and promoting the Reuters Trust Principles .

{"txt": "By-standers watch as a booby-trapped car burns after an explosion in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden July 20 , 2011 . \nADEN\\/SANAA | Wed Jul 20 , 2011 7:17 pm BST ADEN\\/SANAA -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - A blast in a booby-trapped car killed a Briton living in Yemen 's southern port city of Aden on Wednesday , officials said , and the British government urged its citizens to leave the country . \nOpposition officials said one of their political leaders survived an assassination attempt in the capital Sanaa and warned of further unrest . \nThe , was in his 40s and had lived in the southern port city of Aden with his wife and two children , Yemeni officials said . \nThe victim was an independent surveyor working for marine and insurance companies in Yemen . \nA Western shipping source based in Aden said the Briton had just returned from surveying a tanker attacked in July by pirates off Yemen 's coast . \n`` We tend to think that it was some kind of terrorist attack because he was well known , '' the security source said . \nAttacks on foreigners are rare in the port city , which lies east of a strategic shipping lane through which some 3 million barrels of oil pass daily . \nThe impoverished Arabian Peninsula state , neighbor to Saudi Arabia , is grappling with growing turmoil as mass protests calling for an end to President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's rule drag into a sixth month . \nWashington and Riyadh fear the unrest gives al Qaeda 's Yemen-based wing more room to operate . \nWitnesses in Aden said the British victim 's car blew up as soon as he turned on the engine , shattering windows in nearby buildings on Aden 's Mualla Plaza . \n`` He started the car and it immediately exploded and he was engulfed in flames , '' a witness said by telephone . \nOne passer-by was critically wounded in the blast which also damaged nearby buildings , a municipal official said . \nShe said there was no indication who was behind the explosion . \n`` It 's clear that there was some kind of explosive device placed in his car , '' she said . \nA British Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed the Briton 's death and said the government was advising all British nationals against traveling to the whole of Yemen , a position which `` could n't be any firmer . '' \nAden had been relatively quiet in recent months , even as protests in other parts of the country erupted into sporadic violence . \nThe neighbouring Abyan province has witnessed daily bloodshed since Islamist militants seized the city of Jaar in March and the provincial capital of Zinjibar in May . \nThe army , which says the militants are part of al Qaeda 's Yemen-based wing , launched an offensive to retake Zinjibar five days ago but has yet to regain the city . \nThe army impose a security belt around Aden several weeks ago to try to prevent more militants from slipping into the strategic port city . \nIt had previously reported that several al Qaeda linked operatives had snuck into Aden , where some 54,000 Abyan residents have sought refuge . \nFurther north in the capital Sanaa , opposition officials said the head of the leading Islamist party Islah survived an attack by gunmen . \nSanaa has been the scene of rising violence in recent days following weeks of relative calm after Saleh traveled to Saudi Arabia for treatment on wounds he suffered in a bomb blast at his compound . \nYemen 's opposition coalition said the gunmen fired on Islah leader Mohammed al-Yadumi 's car but he escaped the attack . \nThe group blamed Saleh 's family and forces loyal to him , and warned the move could spark worse violence in the fragmented nation . \n`` Targeting the head of Islah is an attempt to plunge the country into civil war . \nSaleh 's family is deluded in thinking it can remain in power , '' the coalition said in a statement . \n-LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Mukhashaf in Aden , Mohammed Ghobari in Sanaa , Humeyra Pamuk in Dubai and Stephen Mangan in London ; Writing by Erika Solomon ; Editing by Alistair Lyon -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/syriancrisis_reuters/rsd/SyrianCrisis_reuters__2011-07-20__36.rsd.txt.ll_filled"}

{"txt": "BP 's chief executive Tony Hayward has been under fire The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has been made worse for BP by the public-relation gaffes of those in charge of the company . \nA few misplaced words can cause a lot of damage , so why are they getting them so wrong ? \nThere 's a chronic foot-in-mouth outbreak at BP and it does n't look like it will be clearing up anytime soon . \nChief executive Tony Hayward has already been dubbed `` wayward Hayward '' by the media for his gaffes when speaking about the company 's massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nMr Hayward has already been dubbed \u2018 Wayward Hayward \u2019 by the media for his stupid gaffes . \nFacing US politicians in Washington last week he was repeatedly criticised for dodging questions . \nOne frustrated congressman accused him of `` just kicking the can down the road like you have nothing to do with it '' . \n`` The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean '' - Tony Hayward `` There 's no one who wants this over more than I do - I would like my life back '' - Tony Hayward `` We care about the small people '' - Carl-Henric Svanberg He 's not the only one at BP to be struck down by the complaint . \nChairman Carl-Henric Svanberg also attracted criticism last week when he referred to those affected by the spill as `` the small people '' . \nHe apologised , saying his words were `` clumsy '' . \nCrises are unpredictable , but they are not unexpected . \nA good company prepares for the unexpected and a good PR team is poised to do damage limitation . \nSo why is BP getting it so wrong ? \n`` BP 's communication over the oil spill has often been inexplicable and at times simply shocking , '' says Sharon Francis , chief executive of Media First , specialists in communication training . \n`` You 'd think those in charge of one of the world 's biggest companies would know better than most that one stupid comment travels round the world in a nanosecond . \n`` BP was slow reacting to what happened and failed to express appropriate concern and compassion , which is vital . \nAs a consequence , any apology now just seems hollow . '' \nBP initially appeared to understate the extent of the situation , with Mr Hayward saying the spill would not be a major problem because the gulf was `` a very big ocean '' . \nContrition and reparation are called for , says Professor Stephen Brammer , who lectures on corporate reputation at Bath University . \n`` Say you are sorry as quickly as you can and tell the world what you are doing to put things right , '' he says . \nShow empathy with those affected Often over reaction is what 's needed , not trying to play things down . \nIn 1982 seven people in Chicago died after taking poisoned Tylenol tablets . \nJohnson & Johnson reacted quickly , including a huge US-wide recall of the product - some 31 million bottles - at an estimated cost of $ 100 million . \n`` A nationwide recall probably was n't needed , but it showed that the company was putting protecting the public above profit , '' says Mr Brammer . \nIt 's also crucial to express empathy and that you understand the people affected . \nSo far Mr Hayward 's biggest gaffe has been saying he wanted the crisis to end so he could have his `` life back '' . \nHe later apologised and said the remark had been `` hurtful and thoughtless '' , especially to the families of the 11 men who died when the well exploded . \n`` No one cares how the crisis is personally affecting the life of the head of BP , '' says Prof Brammer . \n`` Getting his life back probably means being able to drop his kids off at school again or take his wife out for dinner . \nIt was a stupid thing to say when he is dealing with such a catastrophe . '' \nThis series of public-relation gaffes meant Mr Hayward reportedly received intensive training for his appearance before addressing US politicians at a Congressional hearing in Washington last week . \nIt did n't help , say critics . \nHe was accused of dodging questions , the assumption being that he had been briefed by BP 's lawyers not to accept any responsibility . \nBut that does n't mean you simply shut down , says Mr Brammer . \n`` Trying to dodge things is ridiculous , it 's never a good reputation-management strategy . \nEven when you do not want to accept responsibility , you can distinguish between the legal and the moral . \nIt is never good to use the legal mechanism to prevent discourse . '' \nMedia consultants say BP has also suffered hugely because it has too few Americans leading its communications strategy . \nThis has been extremely costly because Britain and America may speak the same language , but they use it very differently . \n`` BP 's communication has been done in a very British way , it has been very self-deprecating , '' says Ms Francis . \n`` Americans do n't deal in such language , they do n't see themselves as ` little people ' - they are a can-do culture . '' \nSo why did a such a big company get it so wrong ? \nMost companies have strategies in place to deal with a crisis , say communication consultants . \nBut that 's not enough , they should have regular `` risk audits '' to make sure plans are up to date and not just `` filed away and forgotten '' . \nIt 's also should n't have a one-size-fits-all approach . \n`` I think that has been BP 's downfall , '' says Ms Francis . \n`` Situations vary and companies should adapt , like getting American PR people in to help in the case of BP . '' \nSo is there any way back for BP ? \nPossibly , but it will take years of the right action and words . \n`` It 's going to be facing a reputation issue for years , but it is possible to rebuild things , '' says Jonathan Hemus , crisis-management expert with Insignia communications . \n`` Other companies should look and learn from all of this .

Resolution 1973 , according to NATO sources . \nUnder what some officials were calling `` no-fly plus , '' NATO would be given more robust rules of engagement to ensure that civilians are protected , the sources said . \nAnd , in an effort to ease concerns from Turkey -- the organization 's sole Muslim country -- coalition forces would be allowed to withdraw from certain missions , such as those involving attacking Libyan soldiers , the sources said . \nmedia trip goes wrong Gadhafi tanks turned into wreckage What does Libya 's military have left ? \nShould coalition support Libyan rebels ? \nAs for the prospect of a more robust mandate , one that the U.S.-led coalition has followed so far , `` That decision has not been made yet , '' Rasmussen said . \nHe added that NATO will have outside help in whatever mission it opts to pursue . \n`` It 's of utmost importance to stress that this is not primarily a NATO operation , '' he said . \n`` It is a broad international effort in which we will include partners from the region that have pledged to contribute to this protection of civilians in Libya . '' \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton , who will travel to London to attend an international meeting on Libya on Tuesday , gave an upbeat assessment of what the coalition has accomplished in five days . \n`` We have made significant progress , '' she told reporters . \n`` A massacre in Benghazi was prevented . \nGadhafi 's air force and air defenses have been rendered largely ineffective , and the coalition is in control of the skies above Libya . '' \nShe welcomed the fact that the coalition includes aircraft and pilots from Qatar and Thursday 's announcement by the United Arab Emirates that it , too , would send planes to protect Libya 's civilians . \n`` In the days ahead , as NATO assumes command-and-control responsibilities , the welfare of those civilians will be of paramount concern , '' she said . \n`` This operation has already saved many lives , but the danger is far from over . '' \nRasmussen said the issue did not represent a split in NATO over the mission . \nHowever , he also acknowledged that , if unaltered , the agreement would mean the overall mission would have two parts , with NATO enforcing the no-fly zone and the U.S.-led coalition handling a naval blockade and airstrikes . \nThursday 's deal was reached after a conference call among Clinton and her counterparts from Britain , France and Turkey , according to diplomatic officials who spoke on condition of not being identified by name . \nSo far , U.S. forces have shouldered the bulk of the mission , according to figures provided by the Pentagon . \nOf the 175 Tomahawk missiles fired , 168 were from the United States and seven from Great Britain , the only two countries to possess them , while U.S. planes have flown almost two-thirds of the sorties and U.S. ships comprise more than two-thirds of the total involved . \nThe flurry of diplomatic activity came as the battle for control of Libya was continuing to unfold . \nAfter a fifth consecutive night of pounding by coalition jets , Libyans gathered at a seaside cemetery in Tripoli on Thursday for the funerals of 33 people Gadhafi 's government said were victims of an airstrike . \nState television said the dead were victims of the `` crusader colonial aggression . '' \nEarlier , a Libyan government official said coalition planes struck the suburb of Tajura and state TV showed images of fires , smoldering vehicles and the charred bodies of the dead . \nAt the cemetery , anger trumped grief and Gadhafi 's message was loud and clear : innocent people were wrongly killed and the Libyan people will fight back . \nCNN could not independently verify the circumstances of the deaths or who the victims were . \nIn Tripoli , CNN reporters go on government-organized tours in an effort to do their own reporting ; Libyan authorities forbid independent movement by international journalists in Tripoli . \nFighting on Libya 's front lines White House answers Libya questions What could be the end game in Libya ? \nMilitary leaders talk U.S. role in Libya The reports of civilian deaths were given little credence by coalition forces , which launched airstrikes Thursday near Tripoli , Misrata and Ajdabiya in Libya . \n`` The only civilian casualties we know are for certain are the ones that the Libyan government itself has caused , '' U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said . \nAt the United Nations , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he has seen no signs of a cease-fire by Libyan government authorities , as called for by U.N. Resolution 1973 , which was hurriedly passed last Thursday as Libyan forces were closing in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nBan told council members , `` to the contrary , fierce battles continue in and around the cities of '' Ajdabiya , Misrata and Zinan . \nHe added that his envoy told Libyan authorities that if the government did not comply with the cease-fire resolution , `` the Security Council was prepared to take additional measures . '' \nBan said he had sent his envoy to an African Union meeting to be held Friday in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , at which representatives of the Gadhafi government and the opposition were expected to attend . \n`` Their aim : to reach a cease-fire and political solution . '' \nBut there was no sign that any such solution was near . \nThe battle for Misrata , Libya 's third-largest city , has been ongoing for more than a week . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said Thursday that many residents remain trapped in their homes without electricity and communications and with a dwindling supply of food and water . \nIn the east , Gadhafi 's tanks were shelling Ajdabiya , where fighting had occurred the day before . \nLoyalist forces still controlled the northern and western gates to the city . \n`` This underlines the appalling danger its inhabitants would be in without coalition action , as do continued threats by Gadhafi forces to ` massacre ' residents in areas under bombardment , '' Hague said . \nThe coalition has established a no-fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya 's coast . \nFrench jets fired air-to-ground missiles on a Libyan combat aircraft Thursday that was in violation of the no-fly mandate , destroying it , the French Defense Ministry said . \nThe plane was struck as it was landing in a Misrata airfield . \nThe civil war was sparked in February by protests demanding an end to Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . \nThe Libyan strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action beginning last weekend . \nThough the rebels ' position may have improved since then , a U.S. official said Gadhafi 's forces still have the upper hand . \nThey remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , are relatively well-organized and continue to fight effectively , the official said . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson , Arwa Damon , Elise Labott , Paula Newton and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report .

'' \nMy apparently unenthusiastic neighbor at a concert given by Syrian hip hop group LaTlateh in Beirut seemed to be in good company . \nCrammed into a tiny , smoky concert hall , most of the unsmiling crowd was sitting at tables , and not a single person was dancing . \nThis was not a typical hip-hop concert . \nA Western observer might put the limp atmosphere down to the fact that the culture of hip-hop is still fledgling in the Arab world , its development stunted by its incompatibility with some Arab regimes . \nAl Sayyed Darwish , Watar and Abu Koulthoum . \n`` The regime was afraid of cultural expression , '' said Al Sayyed Darwish . \nMusic and revolution have always gone hand-in-hand and the Arab Spring is no exception . \nThe Syrian uprising is providing optimum conditions for straight-talking rap to flourish , and one particular Syrian band , LaTlateh , are articulating the feelings of a nation . \n`` I do n't like the music , but I like the words . \nI feel the words . \nThe lyrics really express my feelings . \nWe are n't dancing because we are listening to the lyrics , '' my neighbor said . \nLaTlateh is a Damascus-based three-piece hip-hop outfit comprising Al Sayyed Darwish , Watar and Abu Koulthoum . \nThey perform alongside producer Dab Snakkr , whose music documents the day-to-day struggle of the Syrian uprising . \n`` The situation in Syria is what motivates us to write . \nHow can we sit by and watch all the pain and suffering that is going on around us and not speak out ? '' \nIn the first few months of the revolution , so much of Syria 's cultural elite left the country , either hounded by the regime or in search of better working conditions . \nLaTlateh has garnered a huge following across the region because they remained in their base in Damascus , traveling between the embattled capital and Lebanon . \nThey write lyrics about Syrians , for a Syrian audience . \nThe boys , along with a wider group of Arab musicians , are contributing peacefully to the popular uprising through a movement called The Third Line . \nOf course there are always problems with cultural activities in Syria . \nThe regime was afraid of cultural expression '' The Third Line advocates a third alternative to the existing pro- and anti-regime dichotomy , and aims to uphold the truth and serve Syria 's national interests . \n`` Everybody has a view but there is hypocrisy on all sides . \nWe are trying to find the truth . \nThe third line is about breaking down divisions because each party is only benefiting from its own side , '' Dab Snakkr said . \nThe group want to promote freedom of expression and democracy and are against President Bashar al-Assad 's regime . \nEach member brings to the table his own interpretation of the situation in Syria , reflecting the conflicting opinions which exist in Syrian society . \nThe crisis in Syria has afforded LaTlateh a voice , but the group faced many obstacles before arriving at this point - and they are far from having overcome them all . \nAl Sayyed Darwish 's critique of early Arab hip-hop is nothing short of disparaging , and the group are keenly aware of the fact that real exposure for the Arab hip-hop scene has come with the revolution . \nWatar describes the pre-revolution hip-hop scene as weak . \nPrior to the uprisings , trying to make music in Syria 's political and financial climate was not easy . \n`` Our problems were pretty simple . \nThere was simply no support . \nWe did our first concert by paying for it ourselves , '' Watar says . \n`` We did other concerts with money from the US embassy and French cultural center - but it was only really symbolic funding . \nOf course there are always problems with cultural activities in Syria . \nThe regime was afraid of cultural expression , '' he adds . \nThe development of hip-hop in Syria has not just been limited by the political situation . \nMost Syrians ' experience of rap has been through mainstream US or British artists , rapping about issues alien to most of Syrian society . \nI stretched out my hand waiting for sustenance and pleasure I 've become like a bird chained to the wall Tomorrow when I travel and the homeland grows old , the new generation , the extinct generation , will understand that we really had no choice I have a desire to walk naturally along my road My name has become that of the free who remains incarcerated Its ironic , the regime got stuck in a street called Syria The atmosphere of the city is one of incurable faces The sky is squeezed , but there will be no revolutionary rain without stones We 've started to bury the cities and soon Qatar 's turn will come And we 've eaten so much death just so that you can stand on your feet again on Homs But there are some aspects of rap which parallel oral traditions in the Middle East - from the 1,000-year old Levantine tradition of Zajal , semi-sung , semi-spoken poetry battles akin to modern day rap battles , to the revered oral story-telling tradition of the Hakawati . \nThe situation in Syria has forced Syrian hip-hop onto the international stage . \nPolitical oppression means they can no longer perform in Syria and now LaTlateh is forced to widen its audience and travels the Middle East to perform . \n`` Syrian music is no longer cut off from the world . \nWe can now contribute as Syrians to the creative world in a way we could n't before , '' explains Abu Koulthoum . \nFor Dab Snakkr so far the uprising has meant that LaTlateh can express itself in a way they hope can be preserved , whatever the future holds for Syria . \n`` The most important thing right now is to create a space for free expression - a freedom of expression that was stifled to the point that two or three years ago we could not even imagine that a revolution would even happen .

'' \nThe authorities knew they could not keep the refugees trapped in schools without running into serious trouble with their Iraqi relatives . \nOn the same day of the march , a high-profile delegation from Baghdad arrived to sort out the problem . \nIt included the prime minister 's security adviser and the finance minister , who is himself from Anbar . \nA compromise was hammered out , under which refugees would be able to leave the schools provided they had relatives who could `` sponsor '' them , and provide written guarantees to the government . \nThe mechanisms to implement the agreement are still being debated by local authorities and the central government , but the incident highlights a wider divergence over the Syrian crisis . \nAs the Iraqi government watches with growing unease the gains made by the rebels in Syria , many in Iraq can not wait for a final blow to President Bashar al-Assad 's regime to be delivered . \nEveryone here knows the end of Mr Assad 's rule in Damascus could bring many barriers crashing down , including the border line cutting the Syrian desert into two . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .

General Assembly . \n`` The United States has sanctions regarding Syria . \nOur foreign ministers will be working together to decide what our sanctions may be , '' Erdogan said . \n`` As a result of this cooperation , the sanctions may not resemble those on Libya . \nEvery sanction differs according to country , people and demographic structure . \nThus , sanctions on Syria will be different . \nWe have preliminary studies on the issue , '' he said , according to the state agency Anatolian . \nAssad 's attempt to stamp out dissent by having troops and tanks assault restive areas has prompted the United States and European Union to gradually escalate economic sanctions against the authoritarian Damascus leadership . \nTurkey , which has been Syria 's main trading partner , had resisted sanctions up to now after suffering the consequences of past generations of sanctions imposed on next-door Iraq during Saddam Hussein 's rule and now on Iran , another neighbor . \nBilateral trade between Turkey and Syria was $ 2.5 billion in 2010 , up from $ 500 million in 2004 . \nInvestments of Turkish firms in Syria reached $ 260 million , Turkish official data show . \nTurkey , a Muslim member of NATO that has applied to join the European Union , is one of the few countries in the world that has had open communication lines with Damascus . \nUnder Turkey 's policy of `` zero problems '' with its neighbors , Ankara built up political and commercial relations with Syria after the two almost went to war in the 1990s over Kurdish guerrillas harboured by Damascus . \nBut with Syrian refugees fleeing to Turkish camps across the border and Assad defying repeated international calls to return his forces to barracks and open up to reform , Turkey has found itself in the awkward position of trying to champion democracy in the region while maintaining ties , especially for trade purposes , with the Middle East 's autocratic leaders . \nThe United States and EU , along with the governments of Britain , France and Germany , have called for Assad to quit . \nErdogan , who once vacationed together with Assad and his family on the Turkish Mediterranean coast , has stopped short of calling for his departure . \nBut he told journalists in New York , `` We do not have any confidence in the current government , '' and accused Damascus of launching `` dark propaganda against Turkey '' . \nThe Syrian crisis has pushed Ankara and Washington into closer cooperation , despite U.S. concerns over a fraying of relations between its allies Turkey and Israel . \nSyria sits at the heart of numerous conflicts in the Middle East , and Turkey and Iran have competed for influence there . \nAn unstable Syria would have repercussions for Turkey , which also borders Iran and Iraq .

{"txt": "BP tries to thread tube into leaking pipe to stop flow Forecasters predict the slick will begin washing ashore in more states soon BP is using undersea robots in a bid to jam a tube into a broken pipe that is gushing oil into the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe attempt to divert the oil flow came as workers readied a so-called `` top hat '' containment dome to be lowered over the leak . \nSome scientists have significantly raised their estimate of the rate of oil flow , as the surface slick has grown to 3,650 sq miles -LRB- 9,500 sq km -RRB- . \nSeveral US senators have proposed a ban on drilling off the Pacific coast . \nFive thousand feet -LRB- 1,500 m -RRB- below the surface on Friday , remote-controlled robots were attempting to thread a six-inch -LRB- 15cm -RRB- tube surrounded by a stopper into the 21-inch pipe spewing crude oil and natural gas at a high rate into the water . \nIf the attempt is successful , the tube could siphon leaking oil and gas into a tanker on the surface , allowing oil workers to concentrate on cleaning up the already-spilled crude . \nIn addition , BP was preparing to deploy a metal box , or top hat , to cap the leak . \nA previous attempt to lower a bigger box on to the well site failed . \nPresident Barack Obama has stressed that BP must pay for the clean-up from the disaster . \nSenators from coastal states have proposed a ban on oil drilling on the Pacific coast . \nOn Friday , Mr Obama was due to meet advisers to discuss the spill response , and he is expected to discuss the latest efforts to plug the leak in remarks later . \nAs of late Thursday , more than 500 vessels and 13,000 people were involved in the spill containment and clean-up effort . \nWorkers had deployed more than 1.4 million feet of boom to arrest the spread , and had dumped more than 475,000 gallons of chemical dispersant into the gulf waters . \nMeanwhile , oil has begun washing ashore on the barrier islands in the gulf in the form of tar balls and patties . \nUS officials forecast the slick could make landfall on Saturday in Florida , Mississippi and Alabama . \nThe spill is poised to become the worst environmental disaster in US history . \nSome scientists have begun to cast doubt on official estimates of the rate of oil flow , saying the widely repeated figure of 5,000 barrels of oil per day dramatically understates the amount . \nFlorida State University oceanographer Ian MacDonald has estimated the rate is four or five times the government figure , the New York Times reported . \nOther researchers who have analyzed underwater video of the leak released by BP told US news media outlets the leak was spewing about 70,000 barrels per day , with a margin of error of plus or minus 20 % . \nThe spill began on 20 April , when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig , leased by BP from Swiss drilling giant Transocean , exploded into flames and sank two days later , killing 11 workers . \nIn testimony before US House and Senate committees this week , BP , Transocean and US oil services company Halliburton each pointed the finger of blame at the others . \nUnderwater efforts to cap oil leak Initially , BP tried to lower a 125-tonne , 18-metre -LRB- 59 feet -RRB- high container dome over the main leak on the sea floor . \nHowever , this failed when gas leaking from the pipe mixed with water to form hydrates , ice-like crystals , that blocked up the steel canopy . \nInstead , engineers have lowered a smaller device onto the site . \nDubbed the Top hat , it will sit over the tear in the pipe and partially stop the leak . \nTo prevent the build up of hydrates , methanol is pumped into the top hat to disperse the water and gas . \nThe top hat is 1.5 m -LRB- 5 feet -RRB- high and 1.2 m in diameter . \nTwo special side lines are used to pump methanol into the top hat to displace water and gas leaking from the broken oil pipe . \nThis should prevent the build-up of hydrates . \nOnce in place , oil can be pumped up to the surface . \nBP plan to lower the original subsea containment dome over the top hat to provide a better seal over the leaking site and pump oil up to the surface . \nThis time , it will be attached to a pipe that can pump warm water into the dome to prevent the build-up of hydrates .

{"txt": "Lovely 's adoption papers have been lost in the earthquake Dozens of Haitian orphans have been airlifted to the US after authorities there said they would speed up the adoption process - but hundreds more are caught up in red tape . \nThe BBC 's Rajesh Mirchandani has followed the story of a girl called Lovely . \nHaiti 's earthquake destroyed not just buildings , but families too . \nNow in its chaotic aftermath , we drive through the crowded ruins of Port-au-Prince to the suburb of Carrefour , past corrugated tin shacks , now leaning into each other , and narrow side alleys choked with debris . \nWe are looking for one small child , trapped not by rubble but by bureaucracy . \nAt an orphanage I show them a photograph of a girl called Lovely . \nIt was given to me by the American couple who are hoping to become her new parents . \nAt home in Los Angeles , Janelle and Bryan Benedict showed me a video they took when they last visited the girl last summer . \nThey have been working through the lengthy adoption process since Lovely was six months old . \nShe turned two on the day of the earthquake and their anguish was clear . \n`` I worry about her , '' says Janelle . \n`` About the fear she is experiencing . \nWe just want to get her out of there as quickly as possible . '' \nBut they are in a difficult position . \nLike hundreds of other Haitian orphans , Lovely 's adoption papers were stored in government buildings that collapsed in the quake . \nAt the orphanage where Lovely lives , dozens of children have parents overseas , desperate to get them out . \nMost seem oblivious to the destruction around them . \nTheir smiles light up their faces - and ours . \nLovely is malnourished and has an infection on her arm Lovely is carried out to meet us . \nShe is tiny through malnourishment , her arm bears the sores of an infection and her eyes barely register our presence . \nBut what horrors she must have seen . \nThe 70 or so orphans here all survived the quake . \nWe see only the front of the building but it does not look seriously damaged , and the level of care seems good . \nBut two sister orphanages in Petionville and Leogane were badly damaged and those children are now here , a house overcrowded with tiny evacuees . \nThere are also American parents staying here . \nThey felt they could speed up the evacuation of their little ones by coming here in person . \nThey need the Haitian government to give its stamp of approval for the children to leave . \nBut an already lumbering bureaucracy has been knocked off its feet . \nConfusion reigns and leads to delays . \nThe buses drive through the airport gates and straight on to the tarmac . \nThis is what happens when the Americans speed things up In addition , some aid agencies are calling for a halt to adoptions , because they believe the earthquake has provided an opportunity for child traffickers . \nWith papers lost , it 's harder for would-be parents to prove they were already part of the adoption process before the earthquake , and the worry is criminals could take advantage . \nThat means Lovely and hundreds more children must wait and endure . \nThe next day we visit the US embassy , guarded by armed American soldiers . \nThey patrol outside and across the street , weapons on show , even though this is foreign soil . \nReporters are tolerated , Haitians moved on . \nWe see more than 100 people queuing in the blazing sun to get in . \nMore on nearby street corners , being corralled by US troops . \nMany hold yellow manila document envelopes . \nThe US says it is cutting through red tape to speed up existing adoptions . \nMany want to go , but many are turned away . \nI encounter a large group of very emotional women , all of them Haitian Americans who have traveled back to try to get loved ones out . \nBut they tell me officials wo n't let them bring all their family members back to America . \nMireille Plaisimond , from New York City , shows me some US home ownership papers - proof , she says , that she can support the four children she wants to take back to America . \nOther flights have taken Haitian orphans to new homes in France Christiane Joseph angrily brandishes her US passport , while Sandra Joseph Marquis from Florida wails : `` what is the point of being a US citizen if our government wo n't help us ?

{"txt": "BP shares suffered another difficult day as the company continued to struggle with the fallout from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe firm 's shares closed down 6.6 % in London , having earlier plunged 12 % . \nAnd the row over the spill has moved to Westminster - with calls for the UK government to try to ease relations between BP and the White House . \nPrime Minister David Cameron will discuss BP with US President Barack Obama this weekend . \nMr Cameron said he understood Washington 's `` frustration '' at the spill , adding that the UK stood ready to help BP with the clean-up - referring to 600 tons of chemical dispersant that have been made available . \nMeanwhile Chancellor George Osborne , who has spoken to BP chief executive Tony Hayward , said : `` We are all concerned about the human and environmental impact . '' \nHe added that `` constructive solutions '' were needed , emphasising that people `` remember the economic value BP brings to people in Britain and America '' . \nThe US is considering taking legal action to prevent BP paying dividends . \nAnd concern has been expressed by MPs about the damage that such action could do to one of the UK 's top companies . \nHowever the UK government has played down fears expressed by some senior figures of `` anti-British rhetoric '' in the US . \nThe US state department has said the oil spill will not affect the relationship between the US and Britain . \nBP 's shares recovered some of the losses during London trading hours to end 6.6 % lower at 365.5 pence . \nThe recent price moves mean the oil giant 's share price has almost halved since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on 20 April . \nThe company has come under increasingly sharp attack by some US politicians for its handling of the spill , described as the worst environmental disaster the US has faced . \nSome of the sharpest comments have come from President Obama , who said he was looking for `` ass to kick '' at BP , and that he would have sacked BP chief executive Tony Hayward - if he worked for him - over flippant comments about the scale of the spill . \nRobert Peston Business editor , BBC News Overnight , the US Justice Department said it was examining ways of forcing BP to suspend its dividend until BP 's full liability for the oil spill is known with more precision . \nAnd the Justice Department is only doing what influential US politicians are demanding . \nWhich is a serious concern to BP , in that it may be a British company by dint of history and legal domicile , but it is very American by virtue of its giant acquisitions of a decade or so ago . \nMy conversations with those at the top of BP indicate that they 're increasingly minded to go for a voluntary moratorium on dividend payments , to bring some kind of fragile truce to hostilities with the US government . \nBut President Obama should be aware that such a suspension of dividends would in effect deprive US savers of some $ 4bn of income per annum . \nOr to put it another way , in a world of global capitalism , Obama ca n't punish BP and expect all or even most of the pain to be felt in Britain . \nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson told the BBC that BP had paid a `` very , very heavy price '' , and expressed concern that the oil spill was beginning to damage the entire image of the UK in the US . \n`` I do think there 's something slightly worrying about the anti-British rhetoric that seems to be permeating from America , '' he told BBC Radio 4 's Today program . \nHowever , UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has downplayed the extent of anti-British feelings across the Atlantic . \n`` No-one has used an anti-British tone in anything that I 've detected , '' he told the BBC . \nAnd Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also played down the prospect of UK-US relations being damaged . \n`` It is about dealing with the ecological problem and dealing with it as soon as possible , '' he said . \nHowever the former British ambassador to the US , Sir Christopher Meyer , told the BBC that the BP issue had become `` a bit of a crisis , politically '' . \n`` The government must put down a marker with the US administration that the survival and long-term prosperity of BP is a vital British interest , '' he said . \nHe added that with nearly 40 % of BP shares held in the US the company was `` a pretty vital American interest too , fully integrated into US energy infrastructure '' . \nAnd the remarks by President Obama prompted Royal Sun Alliance chairman John Napier to write an open letter to the president , saying criticism of the company lacked `` balance '' and was `` unstatesmanlike '' . \nHe told the BBC : `` The language and rhetoric of this dispute is going into the danger zone , is becoming too highly personalised and to that extent , the interpretation over here , not just by me but others , is that it has a certain anti-British rhetoric to it - and that has to be of concern . '' \nUS Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said that BP should compensate other oil companies that have had to lay off workers because of a moratorium on deep sea drilling announced by President Obama in response to the Gulf of Mexico spill . \nMeanwhile , the US Attorney General said he could not rule out taking action to force BP to withhold its next dividend payment - something which former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said was `` quite intolerable '' . \nThe drop in BP 's share price is already bad news for UK pension funds , which invest heavily in the firm . \nThe oil company has said that it pays # 1 in every # 7 of dividends that pension funds receive from FTSE 100 companies . \nHowever the National Association of Pension Funds -LRB- NAPF -RRB- has insisted that BP 's woes `` should not have an immediate or serious impact on those saving into a pension , or on those who have retired '' . \nCable : `` I do n't want to get into the business of lecturing the American government '' It added that pension funds have shifted out of UK shares and that the average fund was now spread across many companies and many types of global asset . \nIn its latest update on the spill , BP sought to reassure investors that it was on a strong financial footing with a stronger-than-forecast cash flow . \nIt also said that the total actual cost to date was some $ 1.43 bn -LRB- # 1bn -RRB- . \nThis compares with a total of # 55bn that has been wiped off BP 's value since the spill began . \nMarket nerves have also been reflected in the value of BP 's bonds , which now trade at levels comparable with junk-rated companies . \nThis is despite the company continuing to enjoy high `` investment grade '' ratings from all three major ratings agencies . \nco. uk Scientists warn BP spill could be double initial estimates - 1 hr ago Guardian . \nco. uk BP oil spill : Nick Clegg pledges to avoid ` megaphone diplomacy ' with US - 3 hrs ago Marketing Week \\* BP brand faces further damage as oil crisis deepens - 4 hrs ago Philadelphia Inquirer As BP sinks , Britons worry - 6 hrs ago RTE Online Cameron urged to intervene in BP row - 8 hrs ago The pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

{"txt": "By Peter Bowes BBC News , Los Angeles The high profile trial in Los Angeles has attracted supporters of both Dr Conrad Murray and Michael Jackson More than two years after Michael Jackson 's sudden death , the singer 's personal physician has appeared in a Los Angeles court . \nDr Conrad Murray , 58 , denies involuntary manslaughter . \nIf convicted , the maximum sentence is four years in prison . \nIt was a hot midsummer day in Los Angeles on 25 June , 2009 . \nHollywood was mourning the loss of the actress Farrah Fawcett , as fans and celebrities paid tribute to the TV star , who had died from cancer , aged 62 . \nBut that day will be remembered for another , altogether unexpected death and for the extraordinary outpouring of grief it provoked . \nPop star Michael Jackson , a month shy of his 51st birthday , was rushed to hospital and pronounced dead , his brother Jermaine confirming the news to stunned fans in a hastily-arranged press conference . \nJackson had recently stepped back into the limelight . \nHe was rehearsing at the Staples Centre arena in Los Angeles for This Is It , his hugely anticipated concert series , which was due to start at the O2 in London on 13 July . \nThe night before his death , he worked until after midnight . \nThe next day , shortly after noon , he was discovered unconscious in his bedroom by his physician Dr Conrad Murray . \nDr Conrad Murray faces up to four years in prison if convicted What happened in the time between those two events remains a mystery . \nAt a preliminary hearing , several witnesses gave detailed accounts of the frenzied activity at Jackson 's home after the singer was found to be unresponsive . \nThe singer 's death , according to the Los Angeles County Coroner , was a homicide caused by `` acute Propofol intoxication . '' \nPropofol is a sedative that is normally used in hospitals to induce or maintain anaesthesia during surgical procedures . \nIt will be up to the jury to decide whether the actions of Dr Murray , during the frantic efforts to revive the singer and in the hours before , caused his death . \n`` We 're finally going to get a full airing of all the facts , '' says Steven Cron , a legal analyst . \n`` In order to be guilty of a crime one has to be grossly negligent , not just minimally negligent , and that 's what they 're trying to prove , '' says Mr Cron . \nDr Murray has strongly defended himself against the charge of involuntary manslaughter . \nHe has insisted that nothing he did should have killed Jackson . \n`` I think the forensic evidence is going to be really important , '' says Mr Cron . \n`` There were only two people in the room and one of them is no longer with us . \nThe other is accused . '' \nThe jury will hear testimony from dozens of witnesses , including some of those who were first on the scene , such as Jackson 's security guards and paramedics . \nExperts will also be called upon to answer questions about Propofol , which will be at the heart of the case . \nIt has been suggested by Dr Murray 's lawyers that the publicity surrounding the case could rise to the levels seen during the murder trial of the former American footballer-turned movie actor OJ Simpson in 1995 . \nBut the judge has refused a request to have the jury sequestered , or confined to a hotel , to shield them from outside influences , as they were during the Simpson trial . \nJermaine Jackson said he is prepared for a media `` circus '' Instead , Judge Michael Pastor has advised them not to `` read , listen to or watch any news report or any other commentary about this case from any source '' and to `` keep an open mind throughout '' . \n`` I think the Conrad Murray trial will be the trial of the year -LRB- but -RRB- it will not be the trial of the century , '' says Linda Deutsch , a special correspondent with the Associated Press , and a veteran reporter at high profile cases in California . \nWhile the defendant , Dr Murray , is not a celebrity , the trial will receive global attention because the alleged victim is Jackson , the superstar who is still worshipped by fans around the world . \nThe proceedings , like the Simpson trial , are being televised . \nMedia outlets from around the world set up makeshift studios near the court building . \nHundreds of Jackson fans lined the street . \nThere will be a lottery every morning to allocate seats in the public gallery . \n`` The fact that it is Michael Jackson puts an entirely different profile on this case Michael Jackson was a fascinating man and he still fascinates even in death , '' says Ms Deutsch . \nThe singer 's parents and famous siblings are all expected to make an appearance at LA 's Criminal Court building , taking it in turns to fill the eight seats the family has been allocated in the courtroom . \nJackson 's three children will not attend the trial . \n`` We 're ready , '' says his brother Jermaine Jackson , `` We 're always ready for whatever . \nWe 've been raised and taught to take it as it comes . '' \n`` I 'll be strong . \nVery , very strong - because I know when the system works for you and I know when it works against you , '' he adds . \n`` I know the truth and I 'm prepared for a circus .

{"txt": "By Barbara Plett BBC UN correspondent The Arab League monitors ' mission has been criticized as ineffective For the UN Security Council , much is at stake when it comes to the Arab League 's monitors in Syria . \nThere are two broad but opposing positions in the Council . \nThe Arab League 's position is that the monitors are ineffective , and the Syrian government is in a better position than the UN to stem the violence . \nIn essence , the divide is over whether the Security Council should get involved in the Syrian crisis . \nOn one side are Western nations -LRB- in particular Britain , France , the United States and Germany -RRB- which see the conflict as appalling government repression of peaceful protesters . \nThey seek a strong condemnation of Damascus and punitive action such as sanctions or an arms embargo . \nOn the other side are states led by Russia , which is intent on protecting its considerable strategic interests with a long-time Arab ally . \nBut it also believes that any Council intervention would have a hidden and counter-productive agenda of ousting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad , and fears a scenario where the UN backs one side in a civil war , as it claims happened in Libya . \nRussia is supported by countries such as China , India and South Africa , which worry that any outside intervention would make a bad situation worse . \nThey want the UN to stick to calls for political dialogue and prefer to leave the mediation in Arab hands . \nHence the importance of how the Arab League judges its mission , and what it decides to do next . \nWe might have a chance of avoiding a Russian veto only if we get a public and official request for action from the Arab League '' End Quote Gerard Araud French ambassador to the UN It might bow to growing criticism that its monitors are failing to stem the violence in Syria and refer the matter to the Security Council . \nCouncil members give considerable weight to regional requests , and Western powers believe such a clear signal could break Russian resistance to UN action . \n`` We might have a chance of avoiding a Russian veto only if we get a public and official request for action from the Arab League , '' says French Ambassador Gerard Araud . \n`` That is certainly a necessary condition , although I do n't know if it is a sufficient one . '' \nBut the Arab League could also decide to continue and bolster its mission , strengthening the hand of Russia , which has argued that the monitors are helping to stabilise the situation . \n`` We think they 've established a foothold there , '' says Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin . \n`` They 're in a better position than initially to have a restraining influence , so we hope they will continue beyond -LRB- one month -RRB- and as long as it takes for the political crisis to be brought to a halt . '' \nIt is not only the Security Council that is divided : members of the Arab League are also far apart . \nQatar is leading the drive against Syria , with quiet support from Gulf states . \nOthers like Algeria , Iraq and , according to a Western diplomat , even Egypt may oppose any referral to the Council . \nArab differences mirror the UN debate over the need for outside intervention and the desirability of regime change , even though they couch their concerns in the language of human rights . \nAnalysts say the Sunni Muslim Gulf states see the end of the Assad regime as an opportunity to weaken Syria 's Shia Muslim ally Iran , which they perceive as a growing regional threat . \nOther Arab governments see the end of the regime ushering in a sectarian and civil war that could suck in players from Israel to Iran . \nFor them , supporting the Arab mission is a way of avoiding any international action that could contribute to the break-up of Syria : not necessarily through a Libya-like Nato operation but through punishing sanctions , no-fly or buffer zones , or the creation of safe havens for the opposition . \nFor these states , the emergence of an armed resistance in Syria is every bit as alarming as the government 's repression . \nSome Arab countries say the monitors are having trouble with the armed resistance `` The feeling is that the Syrian government is in the process of making more of an effort , but the Arab League is especially having problems with the armed opposition and is not managing to penetrate neighborhoods that are today belonging to the opposition , '' Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told journalists at the UN recently . \nGiven these divisions , the Arab League foreign ministers may be unable to come to a definitive conclusion about their monitoring mission when they meet at the weekend . \n`` The most likely -LRB- scenario -RRB- is a fuzzy outcome , '' says one Western diplomat , `` but then we would have to take stock of our options : we are not planning to let this drop . '' \nIndeed , the West can not afford to let Syria drop . \nSome of the ideas floating around here include requesting a special envoy of the Secretary General for Syria , or bringing the Qatari prime minister and Arab League secretary general to New York to brief the Security Council . \nBut that would be no substitute for the strong resolution condemning and perhaps sanctioning the Syrian government that Western states believe is long overdue . \nYet the bottom line remains that the strength of any Council action will depend on the strength of an Arab League mandate . \nAnd without a clear Arab referral to the UN , Western nations will likely face a Russian veto for anything other than the weakest of resolutions . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .

Feinberg , whom President Obama chose as compensation czar , says fishermen such as Cooper are wrong to believe he will pay them not to shrimp . \nThey will be compensated for the time they could n't fish , but `` if a shrimper has the ability to earn a livelihood , there is no longer a need for an emergency payment , '' he said . \nAcross the coast , Feinberg said , people are already seeing the limits of what money - even an oil company 's massive amount of money - can do to right an environmental wrong . \n`` I told 9\\/11 victims when they said , ` Bring back my wife , or my son or my daughter ' - ' I ca n't do that , ' '' said Feinberg , who also oversaw compensation payouts to victims of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . \n`` I ca n't compensate you in the gulf for a way of life that goes back 100 years . \nI can only compensate you for financial damages . '' \nAnd keeping up with that process is proving more difficult by the day . \nA few weeks ago , Feinberg 's fund adopted new policies that paid claims faster and more generously . \nThe result : The rate of new claims doubled , Feinberg said . \n`` People see that their next-door neighbor is getting paid , '' he said . \nSo they say , `` Why do n't we submit a claim ?

{"txt": "Vehicles belonging to forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi explode after an air strike by coalition forces , along a road between Benghazi and Ajdabiyah March 20 , 2011 . \nIt is a war that Barack Obama did n't want , David Cameron did n't need , Angela Merkel could n't cope with and Silvio Berlusconi dreaded . \nPARIS | Fri Apr 1 , 2011 9:14 am EDT PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - It is a war that Barack Obama did n't want , David Cameron did n't need , Angela Merkel could n't cope with and Silvio Berlusconi dreaded . \nOnly Nicolas Sarkozy saw the popular revolt that began in Libya on February 15 as an opportunity for political and diplomatic redemption . \nWhether the French president 's energetic leadership of an international coalition to protect the Libyan people from Muammar Gaddafi will be enough to revive his sagging domestic fortunes in next year 's election is highly uncertain . \nBut by pushing for military strikes that he hopes might repair France 's reputation in the Arab world , Sarkozy helped shape what type of war it would be . \nThe road to Western military intervention was paved with mutual suspicion , fears of another quagmire in a Muslim country and doubts about the largely unknown ragtag Libyan opposition with which the West has thrown in its lot . \nThat will make it harder to hold together an uneasy coalition of Americans , Europeans and Arabs , the longer Gaddafi holds out . \nAlmost two weeks into the air campaign , Western policymakers fret about the risk of a stray bomb hitting a hospital or an orphanage , or of the conflict sliding into a prolonged stalemate . \nThere is no doubt the outcome in Tripoli will have a bearing on the fate of the popular movement for change across the Arab world . \nBut because this war was born in Paris it will also have consequences for Europe . \n`` It 's high time that Europeans stopped exporting their own responsibilities to Washington , '' says Nick Witney , a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations . \n`` If the West fails in Libya , it will be primarily a European failure . '' \nWhen the first Arab pro-democracy uprisings shook the thrones of aging autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt in January , France had got itself on the wrong side of history . \nForeign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie had enjoyed a winter holiday in Tunisia , a former French colony , oblivious to the rising revolt . \nShe and her family had taken free flights on the private jet of a businessman close to President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali , and then publicly offered the government French assistance with riot control just a few days before Ben Ali was ousted by popular protests . \nWorse was to come . \nIt turned out that French Prime Minister Francois Fillon had spent his Christmas vacation up the Nile as the guest of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , the next autocrat in the Arab democracy movement 's firing line , while Sarkozy and his wife Carla had soaked up the winter sunshine in Morocco , another former French territory ruled by a barely more liberal divine-right monarch . \nTelevision stations were re-running embarrassing footage of the president giving Gaddafi a red-carpet welcome in Paris in 2007 , when Libya 's `` brother leader '' planted his tent in the grounds of the Hotel de Marigny state guest house across the road from the Elysee presidential palace . \nOn February 27 , a few days after Libyan rebels hoisted the pre-Gaddafi tricolor flag defiantly in Benghazi , Sarkozy fired his foreign minister . \nIn a speech announcing the appointment of Alain Juppe as her successor , Sarkozy cited the need to adapt France 's foreign and security policy to the new situation created by the Arab uprisings . \n`` This is an historic change , '' he said . \n`` We must not be afraid of it . \nWe must have one sole aim : to accompany , support and help the people who have chosen freedom . '' \nMAN IN THE WHITE SHIRT Yet the international air campaign against Gaddafi 's forces might never have happened without the self-appointed activism of French public intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy , a left-leaning philosopher and talk-show groupie , who lobbied Sarkozy to take up the cause of Libya 's pro-democracy rebels . \nLibya was the latest of a string of international causes that the libertarian icon with his unbuttoned white designer shirts and flowing mane of greying hair has championed over the last two decades after Bosnian Muslims , Algerian secularists , Afghan rebels and Georgia 's side in the conflict with Russia . \nLevy went to meet the Libyan rebels and telephoned Sarkozy from Benghazi in early March . \n`` I 'd like to bring you the Libyan Massouds , '' Levy says he told the president , comparing the anti-Gaddafi opposition with former Afghan warlord Ahmad Shah Massoud , who fought against the Islamist Taliban before being assassinated . \n`` As Gaddafi only clings on through violence , I think he 'll collapse , '' the philosopher told Reuters in an interview . \nOn March 10 , Levy accompanied two envoys of the Libyan Transitional Council to Sarkozy 's office . \nTo their surprise and to the consternation of France 's allies , the president recognized the council as the `` legitimate representative of the Libyan people '' and told them he favored not only establishing a no-fly zone to protect them but also carrying out `` limited targeted strikes '' against Gaddafi 's forces . \nIn doing so without consultation on the eve of a European Union summit called to discuss Libya , Sarkozy upstaged Washington , which was still debating what to do , embarrassed London , which wanted broad support for a no-fly zone , and infuriated Berlin , France 's closest European partner . \nHe also stunned his own foreign minister , who learned about the decision to recognize the opposition from a news agency dispatch , aides said , while in Brussels trying to coax the EU into backing a no-fly zone . \n`` Quite a lot of members of the European Council were irritated to discover that France had recognized the Libyan opposition council and the Elysee was talking of targeted strikes , '' a senior European diplomat said . \nAcross the Channel , British Prime Minister David Cameron , aware of the deep unpopularity of the Iraq war , had turned his back on Tony Blair 's doctrine of liberal interventionism when he took office in 2010 . \nBut after facing criticism over the slow evacuation of British nationals from Libya and a trade-promotion trip to the Gulf in the midst of the Arab uprisings , he overruled cabinet skeptics , military doubters and critics among his own Conservative lawmakers to join Sarkozy in campaigning for military action . \nHowever , Cameron sought to reassure parliament that he was not entering an Iraq-style open-ended military commitment . \n`` This is different to Iraq . \nThis is not going into a country , knocking over its government and then owning and being responsible for everything that happens subsequently , '' he said . \nIn Britain , as in France , the government won bipartisan support for intervention . \nIn Germany , on the other hand , the Libyan uprising was an unwelcome distraction from domestic politics . \nIt played directly into the campaign for regional elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg , a south-western state which Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democrats had governed since 1953 . \nForeign Minister Guido Westerwelle , leader of the Free Democrats , the liberal junior partners in Merkel 's coalition , tried to surf on pacifist public opinion by opposing military action . \nPolls showed two-thirds of voters opposed German involvement in Libya , a country where Nazi Germany 's Afrika Korps had suffered desert defeats in World War Two . \nPresent-day Germany 's armed forces were already overstretched in Afghanistan , where some 5,000 soldiers are engaged in an unpopular long-term mission . \nWesterwelle made it impossible for Merkel to support a no-fly zone , even without participating . \nHe publicly criticized the Franco-British proposal for a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to prevent Gaddafi using his air force against Libyan civilians . \nMerkel said she was skeptical . \nThe Germans prevented a March 11 EU summit from making any call for a no-fly zone , much to the frustration of the French and British . \nRelations between France 's Juppe and Westerwelle deteriorated further the following week when Germany prevented foreign ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized powers from calling for a no-fly zone in Libya . \nWesterwelle told reporters : `` Military intervention is not the solution . \nFrom our point of view , it is very difficult and dangerous . \nWe do not want to get sucked into a war in North Africa . \nWe would not like to step on a slippery slope where we all are at the end in a war . '' \nThat argument angered allies . \nAs the meeting broke up , a senior European diplomat tells Reuters , Juppe turned to Westerwelle and said : `` Now that you have achieved everything you wanted , Gaddafi can go ahead and massacre his people . '' \nWhen the issue came to the U.N. Security Council on March 17 , 10 days before the Baden-Wuerttemberg election , Germany abstained , along with Russia , China , India and Brazil , and said it would take no part in military operations . \nIronically , that stance seems to have been politically counterproductive . \nThe center-right coalition lost the regional election anyway , and both leaders were severely criticized by German media for having isolated Germany from its western partners , including the United States . \nThe main political beneficiaries were the ecologist Greens , seen as both anti-nuclear and anti-war . \nIn Washington , meanwhile , President Barack Obama was , as usual , taking his time to make up his mind . \nMilitary action in Libya was the last thing the U.S. president needed , just when he was trying to extricate American troops from two unpopular wars in Muslim countries launched by his predecessor , George W. Bush . \nObama had sought to rebuild damaged relations with the Muslim world , seen as a key driver of radicalization and terrorism against the United States . \nThe president trod a fine line in embracing pro-democracy and reform movements in the Arab world and Iran while trying to avoid undermining vital U.S. interests in the absolute monarchies of Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and other Gulf states . \nCompared to those challenges , Libya was a sideshow . \nThe United States had no big economic or political interests in the North African oil and gas producing state and instinctively saw it as part of Europe 's backyard . \nObama had also sought to encourage allies , notably in Europe , to take more responsibility for their own security issues . \nSpelling out the administration 's deep reluctance to get dragged into another potential Arab quagmire , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a farewell speech to officer cadets at the West Point military academy on March 4 : `` In my opinion , any future Defense secretary who advises the president to again send a big American land army into Asia or into the Middle East or Africa should ` have his head examined ' , as General -LRB- Douglas -RRB- MacArthur so delicately put it . '' \nProminent U.S. foreign policy lawmakers , including Democratic Senator John Kerry and Republican Senator John McCain pressed the Obama administration in early March to impose a `` no - fly '' zone over Libya and explore other military options , such as bombing runways . \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton had said after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on February 28 that a `` no-fly '' zone was `` an option which we are actively considering '' . \nBut the White House pushed back against pressure from lawmakers . \n`` It would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya , '' White House spokesman Jay Carney said on March 7 . \n`` We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we 're pursuing . '' \nWhile Carney said a no-fly zone was a serious option , other U.S. civilian and military officials cautioned that it would be difficult to enforce . \nOn March 10 , U.S. National Intelligence Director James Clapper forecast in Congress that Gaddafi 's better-equipped forces would prevail in the long term , saying Gaddafi appeared to be `` hunkering down for the duration '' . \nIf there was to be intervention , it had become clear , it would have to come quickly . \nU.S. officials say the key event that helped Clinton and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , persuade Obama of the need for intervention was a March 12 decision by the Arab League to ask the U.N. Security Council to declare a no-fly zone to protect the Libyan population . \nThe Arab League 's unprecedented resolve -- the organization has long been plagued by chronic divisions and a lack of spine -- reflected the degree to which Gaddafi had alienated his peers , especially Saudi Arabia . \nWhen the quixotic colonel bothered to attend Arab summits , it was usually to insult the Saudi king and other veteran rulers . \nThe Arab League decision gave a regional seal of approval that Western nations regarded as vital for military action . \nMoreover , two Arab states - Qatar and the United Arab Emirates - soon said they would participate in enforcing a no-fly zone , and a third , Lebanon , co-sponsored a United Nations resolution to authorize the use of force . \nArab diplomats said Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa , a former Egyptian foreign minister with presidential ambitions , played the key role in squeezing an agreement out of the closed-door meeting . \nSyria , Sudan , Algeria and Yemen were all against any move to invite foreign intervention in an Arab state . \nBut diplomats said that by couching the resolution as an appeal to the U.N. Security Council , Moussa maneuvered his way around Article VI of the Arab League 's statutes requiring that such decisions be taken unanimously . \nIt was he who announced the outcome , saying Gaddafi 's government had lost legitimacy because of its `` crimes against the Libyan people '' . \nThe African Union , in which Gaddafi played an active but idiosyncratic role , condemned the Libyan leader 's crackdown but rejected foreign military intervention and created a panel of leaders to try to resolve the conflict through dialogue . \nHowever , all three African states on the Security Council - South Africa , Nigeria and Gabon - voted for the resolution . \nFrance acted as if it had AU support anyway . \nSarkozy invited the organization 's secretary-general , Jean Ping , to the Elysee palace for a showcase summit of coalition countries on the day military action began , and he attended , providing African political cover for the operation . \nHaving failed to win either EU or G8 backing for a no-fly zone , and with the United States internally divided and holding back , France and Britain were in trouble in their quest for a U.N. resolution despite the Arab League support . \nGaddafi 's forces had regrouped and recaptured a swathe of the western and central coastal plain , including some key oil terminals , and were advancing fast on Benghazi , a city of 700,000 and the rebels ' stronghold . \nIf international intervention did not come within days , it would be too late . \nGaddafi 's troops would be in the population centers , making surgical air strikes impossible without inflicting civilian casualties . \nIn the nick of time , Obama came off the fence on March 15 at a two-part meeting of his National Security Council . \nHillary Clinton participated by telephone from Paris , Susan Rice by secure video link from New York . \nBoth were deeply aware of the events of the 1990s , when Bill Clinton 's administration , in which Rice was an adviser on Africa , had failed to prevent genocide in Rwanda , and only intervened in Bosnia after the worst massacre in Europe since World War Two . \nThey reviewed what was at stake now . \nThere were credible reports that Gaddafi forces were preparing to massacre the rebels . \nWhat signal would it send to Arab democrats if the West let him get away with that , and if Mubarak and Ben Ali , whose armies refused to turn their guns on the people , were overthrown while Gaddafi , who had used his airforce , tanks and artillery against civilian protesters , survived in office ? \nThe president overruled doubters among his military and national security advisers and decided the United States would support an ambitious U.N. resolution going beyond just a no-fly zone , on the strict condition that Washington would quickly hand over leadership of the military action to its allies . \n`` Within days , not weeks , '' one participant quoted him as saying . \nA senior administration official , speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity , said the key concern was to avoid any impression that the United States was once again unilaterally bombing an Arab country . \nAsked what had swung Washington toward agreeing to join military action in Libya , he said : `` It 's more that events were evolving and so positions had to address the change of events . '' \n`` The key elements were the Arab League statement , the Lebanese support , co-sponsorship of the actual resolution as the Arab representative on the Security Council , a series of conversations with Arab leaders over the course of that week , leading up to the resolution . \nAll of that convinced us that the Arab countries were fully supportive of the broad resolution that would provide the authorization necessary to protect civilians and to provide humanitarian relief , and then the -LRB- March 19 -RRB- gathering in Paris , confirmed that there was support for the means necessary to carry out the resolution , namely the use of military force , '' the official said . \nWhen Rice told her French and British counterparts at the United Nations that Washington now favored a far more aggressive Security Council resolution , including air and sea strikes , they first feared a trap . \nWas Obama deliberately trying to provoke a Russian veto , a French official mused privately . \n`` I had a phone call from Susan Rice , Tuesday 8 p.m. , and a phone call from Susan Rice at 11 p.m. , and everything had changed in three hours , '' a senior Western envoy told Reuters . \n`` On Wednesday morning , at the -LRB- Security -RRB- Council , in a sort of totally awed silence , Susan Rice said : ` We want to be allowed to strike Libyan forces on the ground . ' \nThere was a sort of a bit surprised silence . '' \nRight up to the day of the vote , when Juppe took a plane to New York to swing vital votes behind the resolution , Moscow 's attitude was uncertain . \nSo too were the three African votes . \nBritish and French diplomats tried desperately to contact the Nigerian , South African and Gabonese ambassadors but kept being told they were in a meeting . \n`` There was drama right up to the last minute , '' another U.N. diplomat said . \nThat day , March 17 , Clinton had just come out of a television studio in Tunis , epicenter of the first Arab democratic revolution , when she spoke to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on a secure cellphone . \nLavrov , who had strongly opposed a no-fly zone when they met in Geneva on February 28 and remained skeptical when they talked again in Paris on March 14 , told her Moscow would not block the resolution . \nThe senior U.S. official denied that Washington had offered Russia trade and diplomatic benefits in return for acquiescence , as suggested by a senior non-American diplomat . \nHowever , Obama telephoned President Dimitry Medvedev the following week and reaffirmed his support for Russia 's bid to join the World Trade Organization , which U.S. ally Georgia is blocking . \nChina too abstained , allowing the resolution to pass with 10 votes in favor , five abstentions and none against . \nIt authorized the use of `` all necessary measures '' - code for military action -- to protect the civilian population but expressly ruled out a foreign occupation force in any part of Libya . \nThe United States construes it to allow arms sales to the rebels . \nMost others do not . \nReuters reported exclusively on March 29 that Obama had signed a secret order authorizing covert U.S. government support for rebel forces . \nThe White House and the Central Intelligence Agency declined comment . \nClinton said no decision had been taken on whether to arm the rebels . \nNo sooner had the first cruise missiles been fired than the Arab League 's Moussa complained that the Western powers had gone beyond the U.N. resolution and caused civilian casualties . \nHis outburst appeared mainly aimed at assuaging Arab public opinion , particularly in Egypt , and he muted his criticism after telephone calls from Paris , London and Washington . \nTurkey , the leading Muslim power in NATO with big economic interests in Libya , bitterly criticized the military action in an Islamic country . \nThe Turks were exasperated to see France , the most vociferous adversary of its EU membership bid , leading the coalition . \nSarkozy , who alternated on a brief maiden visit to Ankara on February 25 between trying to sell Turkish leaders French nuclear power plants and telling them bluntly to drop their EU ambitions , further angered Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan by failing to invite Turkey to the Paris conference on Libya . \nItaly , the former colonial power which had Europe 's biggest trade and investment ties with Libya , had publicly opposed military action until the last minute , but opened its air bases to coalition forces as soon as the U.N. resolution passed . \nHowever , Rome quickly demanded that NATO , in which it had a seat at the decision-making table , should take over command of the whole operation . \nForeign Minister Franco Frattini threatened to take back control of the vital Italian bases unless the mission was placed under NATO . \nBut Turkey and France were fighting diplomatic dogfights at NATO headquarters . \nAnkara wanted to use its NATO veto put the handcuffs on the coalition to stop offensive operations . \nFrance wanted to keep political leadership away from the U.S.-led military alliance to avoid a hostile reaction in the Arab world . \nThe United States signaled its determination to hand over operational command within days , not weeks , as Obama had promised , and wanted tried-and-trusted NATO at the wheel . \nIt took a week of wrangling before agreement was reached for NATO to take charge of the entire military campaign . \nIn return , France won agreement to create a `` contact group '' including Arab and African partners , to coordinate political efforts on Libya 's future . \nTurkey was assuaged by being invited to a London international conference that launched that process . \nThat enabled the United States to lower its profile and Obama to declare that Washington would not act alone as the world 's policeman `` wherever repression occurs '' . \nWhile the president promised to scale back U.S. involvement to a `` supporting role '' , the military statistics tell a different tale . \nAs of March 29 , the United States had fired all but 7 of the 214 cruise missiles used in the conflict and flown 1,103 sorties compared to 669 for all other allies combined . \nIt also dropped 455 of the first 600 bombs , according to the Pentagon . \nFor all the showcasing of Arab involvement , only six military aircraft from Qatar had arrived in theater by March 30 . \nThey joined French air patrols but did not fly combat missions , a military source said . \nSarkozy announced that the United Arab Emirates would send 12 F16 fighters , but NATO and UAE officials refused to say when they would arrive . \nBritain 's Cameron spoke of unspecified logistical contributions from Kuwait and Jordan . \nThe main Arab contribution is clearly political cover rather than military assets . \nWhile the duration and the outcome of the war remain uncertain , some political casualties are already visible . \nUnless the conflict ends in disaster , Germany and its chancellor and foreign minister - particularly the latter - are set to emerge as losers . \n`` I can tell you there are people in London and Paris who are asking themselves whether this Germany is the kind of country we would like to have as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council . \nThat 's a legitimate question which was n't posed before , '' a senior European diplomat told Reuters . \nGerman officials brush aside such talk , saying Berlin would have the backing of its western partners and needs support from developing and emerging countries more in tune with its abstention on the Libya resolution . \nMerkel has moved quickly to try to limit the damage . \nShe attended the Paris conference and went along with an EU summit statement on March 25 welcoming the U.N. resolution on which her own government had abstained a week earlier . \nShe also offered NATO extra help in aerial surveillance in Afghanistan to free up Western resources for the Libya campaign . \nA second conspicuous casualty has been the European Union 's attempt to build a common foreign , security and Defense policy , and the official meant to personify that ambition , High Representative Catherine Ashton . \nMany in Paris , London , Brussels and Washington have drawn the conclusion that European Defense is an illusion , given Germany 's visceral reticence about military action . \nFuture serious operations are more likely to be left to NATO , or to coalitions of the willing around Britain and France . \nBy general agreement , Ashton has so far had a bad war . \nDespite having been among the first European officials to embrace the Arab uprisings and urge the EU to engage with democracy movements in North Africa , she angered both the British and French by airing her doubts about a no-fly zone and the Germans by subsequently welcoming the U.N. resolution . \nUnable to please everyone , she managed to please no one . \nAs for Sarkozy , whether he emerges as a hero or a reckless adventurer may depend on events beyond his control in the sands of Libya . \nJustin Vaisse , a Frenchman who heads the Center for the Study of the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution think-tank in Washington , detected an undertone of `` Francophobia and Sarkophobia '' among U.S. policy elites as the war began . \n`` Either the war will go well , and he will look like a far-sighted , decisive leader , or it will go badly and reinforce the image of a showboating cowboy driving the world into war , '' Vaisse said . \nThe jury is still out . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIncome should be much more to the content producer and web publisher . \nOnce upon a time , a market seller in Tunisia set fire to ... the Arab order , NATO , European unity , US politics , ... Big fuel buildup problem if you are a firefighter . \nI now pity the rebels in Libya . \nThey are needing to rely now on the same Europe that could n't even defend its own territory in two World Wars without a massive American commitment , and which needded U. S. military punch even to settle the conflict the Balkansafter European soldiers stood by during masacres . \nPerhaps the rebels should have learned a lesson from Croatia after it got its no fly zone and built an Army before trying to take back the rest of their nation . \nI hope the rebels win and do in fact create a democracy in Libya , but the way the Syrian dictator is acting , he no longer fears a successful revolt in his nation . \nGaddafi is showing that guns for hire do work . \nI just wonder why the rebels have n't also hired mercenaries to form a leadership cohort in conjunction with the soldiers who switched to the rebellion . \nPerhaps though NATO is waiting for Gaddafi to put his tanks and artellery on exposed terrain during their long march to Bengazi . \nWe can only hope . \nThere were some news items reporting that a few big tribes are spproting Mr. G.

{"txt": "A worker contracted by British Petroleum scrapes oil from a beach after it was inundated by the oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon spill in Port Fourchon , Louisiana May 23 , 2010 . \nVENICE , La\\/HOUSTON | Sun May 23 , 2010 7:25 pm EDT VENICE , La\\/HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. government threatened on Sunday to remove BP from efforts to seal a blown-out oil well in the Gulf of Mexico if it does n't do enough to stop the leak , though it acknowledged only the company and the oil industry have the know-how to halt the deepwater spill . \nThe Coast Guard said on Sunday that over 65 miles of Gulf Coast has experienced `` shoreline impact '' and less than half of it could be cleaned up relatively quickly , underscoring the growing ecological toll of the disaster . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar said Washington is frustrated and angry that BP Plc missed `` deadline after deadline '' in its efforts to seal the well more than a month after an oil rig explosion triggered the disaster . \n`` I am angry and I am frustrated that BP has been unable to stop this oil from leaking and to stop the pollution from spreading . \nWe are 33 days into this effort and deadline after deadline has been missed , '' Salazar said after visiting BP 's U.S. headquarters in Houston on Sunday . \n`` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , '' he told reporters as the administration maintained its hard line . \nSalazar 's strong comments followed President Barack Obama 's on Saturday , when he blamed the spill on `` a breakdown of responsibility '' at BP . \nThe unfolding disaster has become a top priority on Obama 's crowded domestic agenda . \nThe chief of the Coast Guard , Admiral Thad Allen , acknowledged on Sunday that the government is forced to rely on BP and the private oil sector to try to plug the gusher . \nAt the same time , BP said the containment method it was attempting on the ocean floor was capturing much less of the leaking oil than three days ago . \nCompany engineers were readying other short-term solutions , the next one expected to start late on Tuesday . \nBut BP Managing Director Bob Dudley said there was `` no certainty '' of success at the unprecedented depths at which they were being tried -- one mile down in the Gulf of Mexico . \nMore than a month after a rig explosion triggered what Obama has described as an environmental disaster and `` BP 's mess , '' oil is still spewing virtually unchecked from BP 's ruptured Macondo seabed well . \nAt a time of mounting U.S. government and public criticism of the company and its executives over the catastrophic spill , Allen said he trusted BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward , who has made comments downplaying its size and environmental impact . \nSheets of heavy oil have washed ashore in Louisiana 's fragile marshlands and lesser `` oil debris '' has also reached the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama in what is seen as an ecological and economic calamity for the U.S. Gulf Coast . \nGiven the lack of a solution so far and the doubts over BP , Allen was asked on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' why the U.S. government did not completely take over the spill containment operation from the London-based firm . \n`` What makes this an unprecedented anomalous event is access to the discharge site is controlled by the technology that was used for the drilling , which is owned by the private sector , '' Allen said . \n`` They have the eyes and ears that are down there . \nThey are necessarily the modality by which this is going to get solved , '' he added . \nAsked too about the apparent growing U.S. lack of confidence in Hayward , Allen said : `` I trust Tony Hayward . \nWhen I talk to him , I get an answer . '' \nBP has deployed a long suction tube down to the larger of two leaks from the well , but a BP spokesman said on Sunday this captured only 1,360 barrels per day of oil over the 24 hours to midnight Saturday . \nThe flow has been declining from the 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- per day the company had said the tube was siphoning off three days ago . \nBP engineers are now preparing a `` top kill , '' pumping heavy fluids into the well to try to shut it off , an operation to begin late Tuesday or early Wednesday , Dudley told CNN . \nMany scientists believe the Gulf spill has already eclipsed the 11 million gallons -LRB- 41 million liters -RRB- spilled by the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker accident in Alaska . \nThey warn the spreading oil could be caught in a powerful ocean current that could take it to the Florida Keys , Cuba and the U.S. East Coast . \nCoast Guard Admiral Mary Landry said 65.6 miles of shoreline has been impacted so far and about 30 acres of marshland . \nShe told a briefing that of the area affected on the coast `` 25 miles ... are really readily cleanable and the others are a little harder access but we 'll get to it . '' \nOf the impacted marshland about half of it has heavily oiled she said the rest `` lightly oiled with sheen . '' \nChurchgoers in Louisiana coastal parishes affected by the spill prayed for God 's help . \n`` You -LRB- God -RRB- can clear that oil up , because that oil was down there thousands of years before it came up in the Gulf . \nSo you know what to do with it , dear God , '' retired oyster fisherman Herbert Guidry prayed in the New Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church in Houma . \nAnalysts say growing ecological and economic damage from the spill could become a political liability for Obama before November congressional elections . \nWhile also promising to hold Washington accountable for proper oversight of the industry , Obama ramped up pressure on companies linked to the spill : BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd. . \nHe believed a `` breakdown of responsibility '' between them led to the disaster . \nBP stocks have taken a beating in the markets in the month since the well blowout and rig explosion that killed 11 workers and touched off the spill . \nIts share price shed another 4 percent on Friday in London , extending recent sharp losses . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nFail closed simply means that they are designed so that they need to be activated to remain open , or in the absence of a signal to an activator forcing them open they close . \nThis is mandated in many situations for safety and fire prevention . \nIt must be mandated on Blow Out Preventers for all offshore rigs . \nThe industry will lobby to avoid this so we the people must be diligent in demanding it without loop holes . \nPlease copy this and post it every where you can Do the math , it s ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY at 70,000 barrels a day x $ 70 a barrel BP will make $ 766,500,000 a year . \nIf BP stops the leak they would not be allowed to complete the two relief wells . \nOnce their grouse negligence is brought out , they would never be allowed to drill that reservoir . \nSo they keep it leaking because that reservoir will pay for the clean up . \nThey are not about to loose $ 10,000,000,000 dollars over the life of the reservoir and pay the clean up cost , unless the Government makes them . \nBP keeps taking wks between actions but they started drilling two wells right away . \nBp should have a second pipe lowered and ready on stand by , they should have tried the hole shot wks ago and the mud fill wks ago . \nIf BP would have stopped the leak wks ago they never get the $ 10,000,000,000 . \nIf BP would come out $ 10,000,000,000 ahead by stopping the leak in 10 days they would have don it , but the clean up cost would have been about the same with no money from the relief wells . \nIT S ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY . \nBelieve me BP DID THE MATH ! \nLets hope that the oil company executives got paid out with sufficiently large bonuses , earned by cutting corners , so as not to be unduly inconvenienced for this science fiction scale catastrophe . \nPerhaps this will get rid of those pesky fisherman , nature lovers , and tourists , who just get in the way . \nSeriously , if they did care about anyone else they would have had a plan in place . \nThe fact is , executives are already paid out , and have no stake in what happens next to their large corporations or banks . \nAn act of unspeakable violence has been done . \nThe people have to take back their own country , and lest this become our French revolution moment , what we really need to pray for is PEACEFUL change , because any non peaceful change will sow the seeds of its own illegitimacy , and only replace one problem with another . \nThe ruling class succeeds because they are more organized than the ruled . \nWe must not allow ourselves to be divided arguing wither the earth is flat . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-05-23__807.rsd.txt"}

{"txt": "Libyan rebels prepare to fire a rocket on the frontline south of the town of Bir Ghanam , July 16 , 2011 . \nFRONT LINE NEAR BIR GHANAM , Libya | Sat Jul 16 , 2011 7:34 pm EDT FRONT LINE NEAR BIR GHANAM , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Ten Libyan rebels were reported killed and 172 wounded in an attack on the eastern oil port of Brega on Saturday , while insurgents drove back forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi in the west . \nRebels in Misrata , the main stronghold in the west , said six rebel fighters were killed and four injured in the past 24 hours . \n`` They said Gaddafi will go to Honolulu , '' he said in a televised speech . \n`` This is funny : To leave the graves of my forefathers and my people ? \nAre you serious ? '' \nHis defiance came a day after Western and Arab powers , led by the United States , said the rebel leadership was the legitimate government of Libya . \nReports have circulated that Gaddafi is seeking a negotiated way out of the crisis . \nLibyan television also reported what it called an `` enemy attack '' on Tajoura district east of Tripoli early on Sunday , the first such bombing raid by NATO near the capital in several nights , a Reuters witness said . \nThe television said the strike had hit `` civilian and military sites '' but did not specify what they were or mention if there had been any casualties . \nBrega 's oil resources make it a prize for the rebels , who have been trying to dislodge Gaddafi 's troops in the face of rocket bombardments , according to Al Jazeera television . \nMost opposition fighters are about 20 km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- outside Brega , kept back by Grad rockets fired by government forces , the network reported . \nThe rebels had however captured four government soldiers . \nIn the Western Mountains , where insurgents are trying to push toward Tripoli , heavy fighting erupted on Saturday . \nSustained gunfire and volleys of artillery could be heard from the village of Bir Ayad , 15 km -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- south of the front line at the town of Bir Ghanam . \nRebels at Bir Ghanam hold the high ground on the outskirts of the town , their closest position to Tripoli , about 80 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- away . \nAhmed , a rebel fighter in Bir Ayad , said a convoy of about 15 vehicles from Gaddafi 's forces tried to approach Bir Ghanam , but the rebels fired at it and the convoy retreated after a about an hour of shooting . \n`` They were in a column at first but when we started firing they split into groups of three or four vehicles and all of them fled , '' local rebel commander Fathi Alzintani told Reuters . \nRebels in the Western Mountains have made progress in recent weeks after repelling assaults by Gaddafi 's forces . \nTheir next goal is Garyan , a town that controls the highway south from Tripoli . \nBut the rebels have been hampered by divisions , ill-discipline and supply problems . \nIn Misrata , the rebels ' main stronghold in the west , six rebel fighters have been killed and four injured in the past 24 hours , hospital staff said . \nAway from the battlefield , Gaddafi has made a series of audio speeches to coincide with state television broadcasts of rallies attended by thousands of people in Tripoli and elsewhere . \nAs loyalists gathered on the streets of the town of Zawiyah , near the capital , on Saturday , Gaddafi said the rebels were `` apostates '' who had `` become Christians . '' \nCalling on the rebels to lay down their arms , he said : `` Islam is being humiliated by the cross ... They are burning mosques with bombs . '' \n`` We have given martyrs , yes ... It 's impossible to compromise or make the slightest concession . '' \nCrowds were shown firing to the air at the end of the speech . \nRebel leaders received a boost in their campaign to oust Gaddafi on Friday when they won recognition as the legitimate government of Libya from the United States and other powers . \nWestern nations said they planned to increase the military pressure on Gaddafi 's forces to make him to give up power after 41 years at the head of the North African state . \nRecognition of the rebels by the international contact group on Libya is an important diplomatic step that could unlock billions of dollars in frozen Libyan funds . \nThe decision came as reports circulated Gaddafi had sent out emissaries seeking a negotiated end to the conflict , although he remains defiant in public . \nThe contact group also agreed on a road map whereby Gaddafi should relinquish power and put forward plans for Libya 's transition to democracy under the rebel National Transitional Council . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWe 're nothing but war mongers anyway . \nMaybe God has chosen us for destruction , and with good reason ! \nAbove all , the European Union must start acting like a responsible force in world affairs , not a many-headed monster . \nThe Financial Times published that on February 23 , right as the civil war in Libya erupted . \nUnfortunately , Europe along with America has continued to act like a many-headed monster , particularly in Libya . \nTo begin with , the West failed to help countries like Libya develop their economies before the war began . \nIn fact , the West promised to help Libya develop its economy after Libya agreed to abandon its nuclear program . \nBut instead of doing that , the West seemed happy to support and encourage organizations intent on overthrowing the existing regime . \nIn particular , Britain supported the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group , a terrorist organization linked to Al Qaeda whose objective was to overthrow Gaddafi . \nIn 1996 , British intelligence even hired that organization to assassinate Gaddafi . \nBritain has connections to several members of LIFG . \nThe founder of LIFG , Norman Benotman , has lived in London since 1995 . \nWhile living in London , he met members of Al Qaeda such as Abu Qatada and Mustafa Setmariam Nasar . \nBefore moving to London , he lived in Sudan where he met with Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri . \nBritain also has connections to another member of LIFG , Anas al-Liby . \nHe also knew Osama bin Laden . \nDespite the fact that America believes he had a role in the 1998 African embassy bombings , Britain gave him political asylum and allowed him to live in Manchester until May of 2000 . \nInterestingly , Libya issued an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden in March of 1998 . \nAt that time , British and American intelligence tried to conceal the origins of the arrest warrant and they minimized the danger of bin Laden . \nThe fact that Britain provided sanctuary to two members of LIFG and the fact the Britain paid LIFG to assassinate Gaddafi suggests strongly that Britain controls the organization . \nAnd the fact that British and American intelligence tried to squash an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden suggests they controlled him as well . \nRead the rest of the article at : This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/libyawar_reuters/rsd/LibyaWar_reuters__2011-07-16__96.rsd.txt.sent-fake"}

Security Council about humanitarian issues Demonstrators gathered in front of the Arab League headquarters Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Arab League voted Saturday to back a no-fly zone in Libya and is asking that the U.N. Security Council impose the measure , officials of the regional body told reporters . \n`` It has one goal : To protect the civilian population , '' Amre Moussa , the body 's secretary-general said . \n`` We will inform the U.N. Security Council of our request to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya , '' Moussa said . \n`` The U.N. Security Council should decide how it will be enforced . '' \n \n\u2122 We welcome the Arab League 's decision to make contact with the Interim National Council , '' which the British government sees as `` valid interlocutors . '' \nThe statement also said that no-fly zones are `` one option being considered as part of international contingency planning to respond quickly to events on the ground as they develop . \nReporter : Gadhafi has the momentum now Rebel forces retreat in Libya Are Libyan rebels losing momentum ? \nHe said Arab League members have reservations about military intervention , but said all countries agreed that a no-fly zone must be imposed urgently to protect civilians . \n`` We hope the Libyan authorities will respect a no-fly decision , '' he said . \n`` Be assured the Arab countries will not accept the intervention of the NATO coalition . '' \nMoussa said the league also voted to open channels of communication with the Transitional National Council , the Libyan opposition 's newly formed administration , and that any talks with that body would be on a humanitarian basis . \n`` We are giving them legitimacy but we 're not giving them political recognition , '' Moussa said . \n`` We are prepared to help evacuate any Arab nationals from Libya regardless of their nationality . '' \nThe Arab League also called for immediate humanitarian assistance and an end to the bloodshed in Libya , where civil war has broken out between forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi and a tenacious opposition movement . \nThe White House cheered the League 's announcements and stressed it will continue to pressure Gadhafi , support the opposition and prepare for `` all contingencies . '' \n`` We welcome this important step by the Arab League , which strengthens the international pressure on Gadhafi and support for the Libyan people , '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement about the Arab League 's no-fly vote . \nOpposition forces made strides in the early days of the rebellion , but Gadhafi 's military has recently gained strong momentum . \nThe military has been pounding the key oil port of Ras Lanuf , once in the hands of rebel forces , and has taken control of towns such as nearby Bin Jawad . \nThe Gadhafi government appears intent on retaking all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure . \nThe League was meeting at its headquarters in Cairo , while hundreds of demonstrators outside urged the international community to step up support for Libyan opposition groups . \nPleading for international help as they continue to lose ground topro-Gadhafi forces , rebels are asking for a no-fly zone that would theoretically thwart airstrikes . \nNo-fly zones are areas where aircraft are not allowed to fly . \nSuch zones were put in place after the Gulf War in southern and northern Iraq as a check on the forces of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein . \nWestern powers have said any action by the international community , including a no-fly zone , would have to have regional support and a clear mandate from the United Nations . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said Friday that he `` wo n't take -LRB- the -RRB- decision lightly '' on whether to use military force , including helping to enforce a no-fly zone , saying it is critical to `` balance costs versus benefits . '' \nWhile France has recognized the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people , the European Union was more restrained Friday , saying it `` welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi , which it considers a political interlocutor . '' \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel was even more cautious in her approach to the council , calling it a possible interlocutor . \nBritain 's Foreign Office issued a statement after Saturday 's vote , saying , `` We welcome the Arab League 's decision to make contact with the Interim National Council , '' which the government sees as `` valid interlocutors . '' \nThe statement also said that no-fly zones are `` one option being considered as part of international contingency planning to respond quickly to events on the ground as they develop . \nThis planning does not pre-judge any particular outcome . '' \nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy said in a news conference in Brussels , Belgium , Friday that `` we consider the National Council based in Benghazi as the proper interlocutors for Libya and they need to be recognized as such and encouraged . '' \nIn another diplomatic development , the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Libya , Rashid Khalikov , arrived in Tripoli on Saturday to discuss access for humanitarian aid . \n`` The international aid community has expressed concerns over the very limited access to various areas in Libya , including those places where heavy fighting is taking place , '' Khalikov said . \nAbout 260,000 people , mostly third-country nationals , have left Libya for neighboring countries , primarily Tunisia and Egypt . \nIn response to the crisis , the United Nations and its partners launched a `` flash appeal '' seeking $ 160 million `` to assist both those leaving the country and those expected to need humanitarian assistance inside Libya , '' the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said . \nMeanwhile , the Libyan government on Saturday took journalists to the eastern city of Bin Jawad , where the government ousted rebels about a week ago . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson said he saw fighter jets in the sky but he did n't see them engage in strikes . \nHe saw some structural damage , such as a blown-out police station and damage to a school and houses , including a Katyusha rocket embedded in the wall of a house . \nSome stores were closed and others had been looted . \nCNN 's Reza Sayah and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report .

'' \nNearly a week after the H1N1 swine flu virus first emerged in California and Texas and was found to have caused dozens of deaths in Mexico , Spain reported the first case in Europe of swine flu in a person who had not been to Mexico , illustrating the danger of person-to-person transmission . \nBoth U.S. and European officials have said they expect to see swine flu deaths . \nDespite worries that a major flu outbreak could hit the struggling global economy , world stocks rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said the U.S. recession appeared to be easing . \nAlmost all cases outside Mexico have had mild symptoms , and only a handful have required hospitalization . \n`` We doubt that the markets will react with the same worry as found during avian flu scares in the past , '' said Citigroup analyst Tobias Levkovich in New York . \nChan also urged companies who make the drugs to ramp up production . \nTwo antiviral drugs -- Relenza , made by GlaxoSmithKlin and Tamiflu , made by Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc. -- have been shown to work against the H1N1 swine flu strain . \nDrugmakers have donated millions of doses of their drugs to the WHO . \nShe also alerted governments to be ready to distribute stockpiles of their drugs . \nVaccine makers were on standby to begin making a new vaccine if needed . \nIn Mexico , where up to 159 people have died from the virus and around 1,300 more are being tested for infection , people struggled with an emergency that has brought normal life virtually to a standstill over the past week . \n`` I 'm depressed . \nI do n't understand where this came from , how it spreads , how long it will last or what it will to the economy , '' said an elderly woman named Licha , sitting on a Mexico City park bench and wearing a surgical mask . \nGermany and Austria reported cases of the illness , bringing the number of affected countries to 9 . \nTexas officials said a 22-month-old boy had died -- the first confirmed U.S. swine flu death -- while on a family visit from Mexico . \nIn the Texas border city of Brownsville , where the young Mexican was first diagnosed and many residents have families on both sides of the Rio Grande river border , some residents said they were now reluctant to venture south to Mexico . \n`` I am extremely concerned because you could die , '' said Santiago Perez , 18 , a student at Pace High School . \nAbout 30 U.S. Marines in southern California on the biggest military base in the United States were quarantined after one was confirmed to have contracted the illness . \nPresident Barack Obama , facing the sudden flu emergency along with his broader drive to pull the United States out of its deep recession , said the Texas death showed it was time to take `` utmost precautions .

'' \nEarlier this week , President Obama seemed to suggest Mubarak step down sooner rather than later , saying an orderly transition to a new regime `` must begin now .

'' \nIt s funny how `` reform '' has suddenly become a priority in some of these countries after decades of repressive governments . \nMeanwhile , demonstrators also are calling for change in Algeria and Sudan . \nAnd in Syria , there are protests planned for this week . \nExperts say these protests sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa are `` unprecedented '' and a `` watershed event for the Arab world . '' \nFor now , the leadership in Saudi Arabia and Libya seems secure , but it 's safe to say a new day is dawning . \nHere s my question to you : What 's next for the Middle East ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nSomebody suggested , `` The devil you know is better than the devil you do n't know . '' \nWhen it comes to Egypt , Hosni Mubarak is the devil we know . \nRuling for the last three decades , Mubarak has maintained Egypt as a moderate regional force in the face of extreme Islamist nations . \nHe 's also helped keep peace with Israel . \nNow Mubarak says he 's not running for re-election and it 's unclear how much longer he will cling to power . \nWhich brings us to who 's the devil we do n't know ? \nHistory suggests we might want to watch what we wish for : Remember when the Bush administration pushed for democratic elections in Gaza and Hamas won ? \nOr go back a little further : When the Shah of Iran was toppled 30 years ago , the ayatollahs took over and Iran became an Islamic republic . \nThe Iranian Revolution was originally backed by many groups - much like the one in Egypt - but the extremists took control of the movement - and look where we are today . \nSome worry the same thing could happen in Egypt . \nThey fear the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood . \nEven though the extremely conservative Islamic organization is banned from Egypt , it 's still the largest opposition group . \nBut not everyone agrees . \nEgyptian opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei rejects the idea that Islamic fundamentalists will take over . \nThe secular ElBaradei says he 's reaching out to the Muslim Brotherhood and that they need to be included in any new government . \nHere s my question to you : What are the risks if Mubarak is removed from power in Egypt ? \nAs Egyptian protesters demanding reform fill the streets by the hundreds of thousands , it 's worth remembering that the U.S. helps control the purse strings in that country . \nAmerican taxpayers give $ 1.5 billion dollars a year in foreign aid to Egypt , second only to Israel . \nAlthough the White House has said it 's reviewing this aid depending on the military 's behavior - One top Republican says now is not the time to threaten to withhold any of this money . \nCongresswoman Kay Granger - who chairs the house subcommittee in charge of foreign aid - says we should n't use the money as a stick to force Mubarak into reforms . \nGranger says most of the $ 1.5 billion goes toward the military - which seems to be a stabilizing force among the demonstrators . \nGranger says Congress should only consider withholding aid if there 's evidence that U.S. military equipment is being used improperly . \nSeveral top Democrats are on the same page , saying the U.S. should remain committed to assisting Egypt . \nThey point to the close relationship between the two countries . \nNonetheless , some experts think cutting financial aid is the best way to get results . \nA bipartisan group of former officials says the administration should suspend all aid to Egypt until the government : Agrees to elections as soon as possible , allows banned candidates to run , immediately lifts the state of emergency that 's been in place for decades , releases political prisoners , and allows for freedom of the media and assembly . \nHere s my question to you : Should the U.S. withhold any of its $ 1.5 billion in financial aid to Egypt ? \nInterested to know which ones made it on air ? \nJack Cafferty sounds off hourly on the Situation Room on the stories crossing his radar . \nNow , you can check in with Jack online to see what he 's thinking and weigh in with your own comments online and on TV . \nWould you ride in a car that drives itself ? \nIs she the answer ? \nShould the #LoneStarState be allowed to withdraw from U.S. ?

{"txt": "Ben Bernanke , Fed Chairman and Newly Minted Radical Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke works the room at the National Press Club . \n-LRB- By Brendan Smialowski -- Bloomberg News -RRB- Ben Bernanke had n't yet sampled his dessert -- a dollar-sign cookie atop chocolate cake -- when his hostess at yesterday 's luncheon rose to deliver a brutal assessment of his tenure at the Fed . \n`` Since Ben Bernanke became chairman of the Federal Reserve two years ago , '' USA Today 's Donna Leinwand told the crowd at the National Press Club , `` the S&P index has declined 35 percent , unemployment rose to 7.6 percent , the highest rate since 1992 , and the economy has sunk into a deep recession . '' \nBernanke nodded and smiled . \n`` I 've actually been chairman for three years , '' he said when his turn came at the microphone , `` so those statistics are not quite as good as you made them out to be . '' \nTrue enough : The drop in the S&P has been closer to 40 percent since Bernanke took over . \nHistory will no doubt judge Bernanke as the man left holding the bag when maestro Alan Greenspan left the Fed . \nBut the economic collapse seems to have had a salutary effect on Bernanke : The academic known for his bland answers and brown socks has been liberated in both word and deed . \nThis student of the Great Depression has taken extreme and unprecedented actions to avert a modern-day sequel , and he 's taken the Fed chairman 's lexicon well beyond basis points and LIBOR and M1 and M2 . \n`` I think we can break the back of this thing , '' he told the luncheon crowd yesterday . \nHe did n't hesitate to say that economic indicators `` have been dismal '' and that unemployment , now 7.6 percent , will go `` above 8 for sure . '' \n`` Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , '' the radicalized Fed chairman said . \nTo prove that , he 's dropped interest rates to near zero and has the Fed lending directly to corporations and buying mortgage securities . \nYesterday , Bernanke left the door wide open to the most radical step of all : nationalizing the banks . \nPresident Obama over the weekend said a `` good argument '' could be made for Sweden 's temporary nationalization of banks . \nAnd no less a free-market authority than Greenspan , in an interview with the Financial Times this week , said `` it may be necessary to temporarily nationalize some banks , '' calling this the `` least bad solution '' to the financial crisis . \nWhen Bernanke was asked at lunch about his predecessor 's sentiments , he voiced no opposition to the idea . \nWhile discouraging government ownership of banks `` for a protracted period , '' he offered no such objection to short-term nationalization . \n`` Whatever actions may need to be taken , at one point or another , I think there 's a very strong commitment , on the part of the administration , to try to return banks or keep banks private or return them to private hands as quickly as possible , '' he said . \nIt would have been hard to imagine Bernanke giving a green light to nationalization when he was an economist in the Bush White House . \nHe was , after all , an architect of some of the policies that created the housing bubble and collapse . \nHe bristled when asked yesterday `` what should be done about regulators who simply fail to regulate , like the Fed 's hands-off stance toward subprime mortgages ? '' \n`` I 'll drop the innuendoes and the slurs and not get into that part , '' replied Bernanke , who was on the Fed 's board of governors earlier in the decade . \nHe maintained that the Fed `` had no direct supervisory authority over what was happening in most subprime lenders . '' \nEven now that he has a security detail , Bernanke still has the affect of an economics professor . \nAt yesterday 's lunch , he put his index finger in his mouth to dislodge food from a molar . \nHis trim white beard , corresponding to a similarly shaped band of black hair around the sides and back of his head , caused his profile to resemble a sort of yin-and-yang symbol as he sat at the dais yesterday , picking at his Press Club lunch . \nBut while he still retained the language of his trade , the `` temporary bilateral liquidity agreements '' and the `` Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility , '' Bernanke displayed a newly acquired talent for straight talk . \nHe acknowledged that policymakers have n't `` stopped the bleeding . '' \nHe said plainly that the huge stimulus package just enacted wo n't `` lead to a sustained recovery '' if the banking system is n't stabilized . \nAnd he volunteered that the Fed 's usual responses `` have proven insufficient '' to halt the fall . \nThis time , the old professor came equipped with a personal anecdote to supplement his data . \n`` The unemployment rate in the small town in South Carolina where I grew up has risen to 14 percent , '' he said , `` and I learned the other day that what had once been my family home has been recently put through foreclosure . '' \nHe was armed with sharp rejoinders , too . \nAsked whether it was a mistake to let Lehman Brothers fail , he shot back : `` Well , the word ` mistake ' implies choice or an option . '' \nAnd he even indulged in a bit of economist humor when talking about the paradox of encouraging people to spend even though overspending caused the problem : `` Somebody once called this the Augustinian principle , which says something like , ` Let me be moral , but not quite yet .

'' \nThe breakaway military accused Saleh of starting a civil war and vowed that he and his entourage would be brought to justice . \nMohammed al-Surmi , a doctor at a Sanaa hospital , said two dead and 17 wounded were brought in . \nThe Defense Ministry website said one officer and one civilian were killed , and 13 soldiers were wounded in the fighting with tribesmen . \nFull casualty figures were not immediately available due to the intensity of the fighting . \n`` Three different dynamics are playing out at the same time , '' said Ginny Hill , who runs the Yemen Forum at the influential Chatham House think-tank in London . \nThe newest element is the street revolution while the power struggle among the elites and fragmentation of the Arabian Peninsula country have been playing out for some time , she said . \n`` Saleh 's departure could be seen as the beginning of a contested and potentially lengthy process , '' she said . \nSaleh 's forces fired on hundreds of protesters in Taiz , about 200 km -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- south of the capital , who were trying to gather at the focal point of rallies dubbed `` Freedom Square , '' witnesses and a Reuters cameraman in the city said . \nAt least three people were killed and scores wounded in the latest fighting there , medical sources said . \nU.N. 's Pillay denounced the killings in Taiz where troops used bulldozers and bullets to crack down on protesters . \n`` Such reprehensible acts of violence and indiscriminate attacks on unarmed civilians by armed security officers must stop immediately , '' Pillay said in an Internet posting . \nFrench Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero condemned the attacks in Taiz . \nHe also said there was no news on three French aid workers who disappeared in southern Yemen on Saturday . \nParis believes they were kidnapped . \nFurther south , government troops and locals have been trying to oust al Qaeda and Islamist militants from Zinjibar after they seized the town of 20,000 at the weekend . \nResidents said bodies were strewn on the streets , the national bank building was burned and explosions rocked the city . \nMost of the inhabitants have fled . \n`` Explosions lit the sky , '' one resident said . \nThe United States and Saudi Arabia , both targets of attacks by Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , are worried that a spreading state of anarchy is emboldening the group . \nOpposition leaders have accused Saleh of deliberately allowing Zinjibar , located near a sea lane where about 3 million barrels of oil pass daily , to fall to al Qaeda to try to show how chaotic Yemen would be without him . \nAt least 320 people have been killed since protests started about four months ago , inspired by popular uprisings that ended the reign of the long-standing rulers of Tunisia and Egypt . \n-LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Mukhashaf in Aden , Khaled al-Mahdi in Taiz , John Irish in Paris , Mahmoud Habboush , Nour Merza , and Sara Anabtawi in Dubai ; writing by Jon Herskovitz and Firouz Sedarat in Dubai ; editing by Mark Heinrich and Lin Noueihed -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/syriancrisis_reuters/rsd/SyrianCrisis_reuters__2011-05-31__111.rsd.txt.app-auth-final"}
{"txt": "John Gray , academic , writer and public intellectual , was an unlikely Thatcherite , then an early Blairite . \nHe is now the scourge of neocons and the disciples of science and rationalism If you had to fit the message of John Gray 's 14 books and innumerable articles on a sandwich board , it would be simple : you 're all doomed . \nQuite who is doomed , and why , has varied with the development of his thought . \nHe started off as a Thatcherite and cold warrior , convinced that the postwar consensus and welfare state could not last . \nAs a writer and public intellectual , he has always argued against the conventional wisdom . \n`` He has no moral authority ; he is now the scourge of neocons and the disciples of science and rationalism , '' Thatcher once said . \nNow he attacks Blair as a dangerous neocon ; he has been an unyielding opponent of the Iraq war and he is convinced that globalisation will end in a welter of resource wars and ecological collapse . \nPeter Wilby , a former editor of the New Statesman who published him for three years , says : `` He 's one of life 's sceptics , really . \nAny kind of ideology - the more he looks at it , the more he decides that it crumbles apart . \nNone of the emperors has any clothes so far as John is concerned . '' \nIn all this , he sees himself as consistent . \nAs a polemicist he has always argued against the conventional wisdom , and usually been about five years ahead of it . \nAs a political philosopher , he believes he has always had a guiding principle : that there are certain limits on human life which politics can never abolish , and never wholly work around . \nUtopian or universal schemes will only make things worse . \nThis sounds like conservatism ; but he also believes that real , reactionary conservatism is no longer possible : `` The right today likes to imagine that it is the voice of the past . \nIn truth ... the fate of the right in the late modern age is to destroy what remains of the past in a vain attempt to recover it . '' \nGray was born in 1947 into a world which the market has quite swept away : the working class of Tyneside , when they still had jobs . \nHis father was a shipyard joiner in South Shields . \nThey never thought of themselves as poor , he says ; others remember it differently . \nHis childhood friend Robert Colls , now a historian at the University of Leicester , who grew up in the same part of town , remembers `` this poor brilliant boy living in a mixed area of town . \nHis dad was disabled in his 50s . \nI think he had a hard time on the money front . '' \nIn 1968 , he went up to Oxford to read PPE on a scholarship . \nIsaiah Berlin was at Oxford then , working on the most subtle and powerful justification for liberalism that anyone managed in the 20th century ; Gray , who became a friend , set out to overthrow it . \nLiberalism , said Berlin , is valuable because it lets people live in many different ways , seeking many different goals . \nBut no one society , Gray objects , can encompass all the humanly fulfilling ways to live . \nRussia under totalitarianism\\/communism was in some respects less materialistic and more respectful of culture than it is now , but these virtues were made possible only by a dreadful tyranny . \nHis arguments on this topic are pitched in academic prose , but they can be boiled down into one line of Mick Jagger 's : We ca n't get no satisfaction . \nWe are not the sort of creatures who could get lasting satisfaction , not just because we often want bad things instead of good ones , but because the goods we want ca n't be reconciled with each other . \nThe Australian philosopher George Crowder claims that Gray must logically endorse Stalin and Hitler as offering legitimate models of society , something Gray cheerfully denies . \nThe fact that our values , though real , are sometimes incompatible does n't mean they have nothing in common . \nIt must be possible , he claims , to build some kind of minimal universal moral framework , even if this does not lead to liberalism : `` No society can be called good which rests on torture . '' \nHis pessimistic twist on Berlin is also part of the rootless conservatism which has made him denounce the projects of the right as passionately as he denounced Marxism . \nHe believes that human life can always be made better , but that this process does not approach perfection . \nNew problems are always arising ; old gains can easily be lost . \nThere is no steady ladder of progress ; but we are able , sometimes , to run up the down escalator . \nHe rejects the idea that political debate starts from human rights . \nThe process seems to him the other way round : that `` rights '' are something that emerge from a political process , and different rights may be produced under different political systems . \nNone is inherent in all human beings , and the ones that we do recognize may conflict with each other . \nWhen they do so , we ca n't honestly resolve the problem by logic which everyone comes to accept , nor even , as Americans do , by handing the matter over to a Supreme Court . \nThe final decision , says Gray , must be political . \nAs a working-class undergraduate , he was a Thatcherite before Thatcher herself , a believer in the market , and a critic of planned economies . \nHe read Hayek in the late 1960s , and understood his essential point to be that markets in some sense know more than any of the people who operate in them . \nIt followed that state planning , and social engineering based on rational discussion were always likely to go wrong . \nThis much was common among Thatcherites in the 70s , but unlike most Thatcherites , he saw that ripping down communities to make way for a market was itself a form of social engineering , though an often anti-social one . \n`` Give him any collection of pigeons and he 'll set a cat among them , '' says his friend the academic and publisher Henry Hardy . \nGray 's views on council-house sales are a good example of his contrarian style - and of his appetite for anchoring large arguments in historical detail . \nThe sale of council houses , he said , might have been good for the Conservative party in the short term , but it did nothing to decrease dependency on the state , as it was supposed to do . \nAll it changed was the form of subsidy . \n`` Spending on housing benefit during 1996-67 was over 10 times the total cost of housing benefits in 1979-80 . \nPublic expenditure on social housing was replaced , many times over , by rent rebates and assistance with the payment of mortgages . \nThe price of privatising municipal housing in Britain has been a colossal increase in welfare dependency . '' \nThis kind of inconsistency in Thatcherism led to his conversion to Blairism . \nAs a Blairite in the days before there was a Blair government , he started to attack the costs of the free market : `` In the United States free markets have contributed to social breakdown on a scale unknown in any other developed country . \nFamilies are weaker in America than in any other country . \nAt the same time , social order has been propped up by a policy of mass incarceration . \nNo other advanced industrial country , aside from post-communist Russia , uses imprisonment as a means of social control on the scale of the United States . \nFree markets , the desolation of families and communities and the use of the sanctions of criminal law as a last recourse against social collapse go in tandem . '' \nThatcherism was not just a local phenomenon . \nIt was also recognized as a global symbol , and this was the next symbol against which he charged . \nNothing could be more alien to his temperament than the 90s ' bland optimism that history was over and the whole world must converge , with greater or lesser success , on the model of the United States of America . \nFor one thing , he argued , globalisation depends on the world being different . \nIf it were all the same , there would be no reason to invest in one part of it rather than another . \nThe vast , destabilising currency markets take as their premise the inequalities between nations , and then act to enlarge them , not to bring countries together . \nThe spread of technology was inevitable and irreversible . \nBut there was no reason to suppose that the spread of American technology meant the spread of American models of society ; and the examples of countries that had successfully enriched themselves with modern technology , such as Japan , shows that their differences from western models were essential to their success . \nAlthough he was prolific - 12 books - and successful , Gray was little known outside academic circles until the mid-90s . \nHis first post , at the University of East Anglia , had been succeeded by a job at Jesus College , Oxford , where he remained for nearly 15 years . \nHe held visiting professorships at Harvard and Yale . \nHis writing has always had a chameleon quality . \nWhen he writes about Berlin his sentences stretch and then tangle and convolute like brain cells . \nWhen he writes about his favorite philosopher , the Spanish aphorist Santayana , his own style becomes elegant and precise . \nIn 1998 he moved to the LSE , as professor of European thought , and in 2000 he published Straw Dogs , with Granta , rather than Routledge , which marked his breakthrough as a public intellectual . \nIt is written in a wrought-up , aphoristic style . \n`` When will the Jews be forgiven the Holocaust ? '' \nhe asks at one stage . \nBut it was very widely and respectfully reviewed . \nHis view of the world cut through the antidepressant euphoria of the 90s with a sense of a much nastier future ahead . \nIn Straw Dogs , his pessimism became truly global , and entangled with environmentalism . \nThe hubris which he had been denouncing all his life , first in socialism , then in neo-liberalism , was now identified with the notion of growth . \nJust as before , nemesis was to be supplied by nature . \nBut this time it was not human nature that would ensure our doom , but nature itself . \nSince then , a series of short , punchy books has kept up with the troubles of the age . \nHis essays for the New Statesman are being republished as Heresies with a characteristic subtitle : Against Progress and Other Illusions . \nHis fiercest scorn has switched to the disciples of rationalism and of science : `` Of all modern delusions , the idea that we live in a secular age is the furthest from reality ... liberal humanism itself is very obviously a religion - a shoddy replica of Christian faith markedly more irrational than the original article , and in recent times more harmful .

\nYou can t eat it . \nA picture doesn t move financial markets , so you can t make money from it like you can on a news story . \nWe hear the news through word of mouth , on the radio or even on the television . \nMost pictures have a lifespan of no more than 24 hours anyway , and everyone can take them these days -LRB- or so they think -RRB- . \nSimple answer : when it comes to integrity , honesty and trust , seeing is believing . \nIt is rarely understood that people are smart and should be left to come to their own conclusions . \nA still picture shot by a Reuters news photographer gives the viewer time to see the truth . \nTake as an example when Sri Lanka declared that it had beaten the Tamil Tigers and a quarter-century war was over . \nA counter claim was made : No its not , we are fighting on , said the Tamil Tigers . \nThe government said that rebel leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran was dead . \nOh no he s not , countered the Tamil Tigers . \nA day later Reuters News Pictures get exclusive pictures of Prabhakaran s corpse being carried through a crowd of government soldiers . \nA close-up image of his face told the indisputable truth Prabhakaran is dead . \nA colleague , who works in the financial news section of Reuters and was born in Sri Lanka wanted to study the picture for quite some time . \nHis response after a few minutes of close scrutiny was Oh my God ! \nIt s really him . \nThat man has impacted my life for over 20 years and now he is dead . \nNo-one can ever tell my colleague different , it s a fact . \nThe story in a news picture taken by a Reuters photographer is irrefutable , unbiased and will form part of history for others to believe in too . \nThis truth , like integrity , can not be bought but has to be earned and then maintained at all costs once lost it can never be replaced . \nMy fear , at 4.25 am , is that not enough people value this precious commodity maybe I should get back to sleep and not worry . \nThe Reuters Financial colleague who got ` awe struck ' by the picture can not be an official endorser , as the article implies , since even most journalists have not met Prabhakaran in real life . \nHowever , since this is the first time an `` open-wound '' picture was published it generates more questions . \n- The real Prabhakaran have thick straight hair with no receding hairline -LRB- refer to recent hat-less pictures -RRB- . \nThe picture implies him having curls and a receding hairline around forehead - The picture implies that the corpse is clean shaven - There are no trauma in the face from the fatal attack and that could imply that the wound was caused by a post-death -LRB- using a machete -RRB- act . \nAlso there are no blood stains beyond and aorund the wound . \nWas someone kind enough to clean him up and shave before photographers arrived ?

{"txt": "The president 's Libya policy comes under congressional criticism `` Of course this is about regime change , '' a congressman says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Despite having CIA agents on the ground and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's exit as stated policy , U.S. officials continue to say the NATO-led military mission in Libya is only for its authorized humanitarian purposes . \nThe seeming discrepancy is part of a delicate diplomatic posture by the Obama administration on the complex overseas operation that involves a U.N. Security Council resolution , a multinational military force and the symbolism of presidential statements and actions . \nWith the military mission shifting Thursday to a new phase of full NATO control after initial U.S. leadership , divisions among alliance partners and within Congress became more evident , exacerbated by the administration 's differing military and political goals . \nPresident Barack Obama continues to insist that arming the Libyan rebels remained an option under consideration , while NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet ruled it out . \nAt House and Senate committee hearings , Republicans grilled Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen on the U.S. role in Libya . \n`` To say this is not about regime change is crazy , '' said Republican Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado . \n`` Of course this is about regime change . \nWhy not just be honest with the American people ? '' \nObama has said the motivation for launching military action on March 19 was to prevent a massacre of civilians by Libyan military forces descending on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nKucinich : Only Congress can declare war Libya hearings aplenty on the Hill Since then , airstrikes carried out mostly with U.S. planes and missiles have taken out much of Gadhafi 's anti-aircraft capability and destroyed ground forces and supply lines . \nWhile Gadhafi 's forces have pulled back from Benghazi , they reclaimed territory from the rebels in recent days , leading to fears of a prolonged stalemate without stronger military support for the rebels . \nOn Thursday , White House spokesman Jay Carney noted the United States turned over control of the Libya mission to NATO that morning -- 12 days after it began -- to fulfill Obama 's pledge to the nation that U.S. leadership would end within `` days , not weeks . '' \nWhile Carney said the United States and its allies would keep up pressure on Gadhafi 's government , he acknowledged that it was impossible to say when the mission would end . \nRegardless of when , he said , `` the scope of the U.S. involvement will be limited '' and Obama continues to reject any possibility of sending in U.S. ground troops . \nAt the same time , a former counterterrorism official confirmed the existence of a presidential finding that authorizes the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct operations supporting U.S. policy in Libya . \nA presidential finding is a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations , and a former senior intelligence official said such operations could include `` advising on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter surveillance . '' \nTop administration officials distinguished between the military mission charged with protecting Libyan civilians and the other non-military efforts -- including sanctions , freezing assets and CIA operations -- aimed at hastening Gadhafi 's departure . \n`` Does the United States have the capacity to unilaterally with military force produce regime change in Libya or another country ? \nWe probably do , '' Carney told reporters . \n`` Is that a desirable action to take when you have your eye on the long game here in terms of Libya 's future , the future ... interests of the United States and the region ? \nNo. '' Obama 's dual-track policy , with the military coalition protecting Libyan civilians while the United States pursues `` as a political , diplomatic and economic policy '' the end of Gadhafi 's rule , is the best fit for the Libya situation , Carney insisted , citing the international backing for the military mission through a U.N. Security Council resolution and Arab League support . \nCritics complained that it is both dishonest and a mistake for the military objective to differ from the policy objective . \nAt a House Armed Services Committee hearing , Rep. Chris Gibson , R-New York , said the mission 's `` military and political goals are not harmonized , '' while Coffman called it `` just the most muddled definition of an operation probably in U.S. military history . '' \nOn the Democratic side , liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio challenged Obama 's legal power to commit U.S. forces to a combat role without congressional authorization . \n`` This is a clear and arrogant violation of our Constitution , '' Kucinich declared on the House floor . \n`` Even a war launched ostensibly for humanitarian reasons is still a war and only Congress can declare a war . '' \nSen. John McCain of Arizona , the unsuccessful Republican presidential nominee in 2008 , warned that pulling U.S. forces back to a supporting role under NATO control undermined the military mission at a key moment . \n`` For the United States to be withdrawing our unique offensive capabilities at this time sends the exact wrong signal both to our coalition partners as well as to the Gadhafi regime , especially to those Libyan officials whom we are trying to compel to break with Gadhafi , '' McCain said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing . \n`` I need not remind our witnesses that the purpose of using military force is to achieve policy goals , '' McCain told Gates and Mullen . \n`` But in this case , not only are our military means out of alignment with our desired end of Gadhafi leaving power , we are now effectively stopping our strike missions all together without having accomplished our goal . '' \nWhile Obama administration officials have described the continuing U.S. role in the military mission as supportive -- involving refueling , intelligence , surveillance and communications -- Gates said Thursday that U.S. strike aircraft such as A-10 and AC-130s could still be made available to NATO . \nHowever , he added that he believed NATO allies had the capacity to take out Libyan ground forces as necessary under the mission 's mandate of protecting civilian populations . \nAppearing before both the House and Senate panels at separate hearings , Gates said the no-fly zone had been established and now needed to be sustained , but acknowledged `` you could have a situation in which you achieve the military goal but do not achieve the political goal .

{"txt": "Gulf oil spill : BP press conference live BP is giving updates on the Gulf oil spill at a press conference in Houston , Texas . \nFollow live updates here BP revealed yesterday that plans to stop oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon explosion had suffered a setback when a build up of crystallized gas blocked pipes in one of its giant sunken towers . \nThe oil company 's long term plan is to drill a relief well from a second oil rig in the Gulf , allowing it to continue to extract the oil . \nThe company 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , is giving an update at a press conference in Houston , Texas . \nFollow live updates from BP here , and email adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk or tweet @adamgabbatt with your thoughts . \nWe 're due to begin any minute . \nI 'm just being bombarded with classical music at the moment . \nHayward says they fight the leak on three fronts - beneath the surface , on the surface , and on the shore . \nIn the `` subsea '' it is the first time the industry has had to deal with anything at this depth . \nA lot of `` real time learning going on '' . \nHayward says the dome was n't as successful as they 'd hoped . \nThere is a lot more gas emerging than they had thought . \nIn the meantime they are moving to position a smaller dome . \nThey refer to the smaller dome as a `` top hat '' . \nIt 's about the size of a barrel - a lot , lot smaller than the 12m high cofferdam they had started using . \nIt will be a lot less effective in capturing the oil , but could be operating within 72 hours . \nThe other measure on the sea bed is to tap into the riser further along the sea bed , and `` tap into '' the riser directly , without having to mess around with sea water contamination . \nThe riser is essentially the pipe that would have pumped the oil to the surface before the explosion . \nBP have `` an armada of ships '' skimming oil . \nThey 've skimmed over 100,000 barrels of oily water , as well as spraying dispersant . \nThey now have a million feet of boom deployed , with a further 2.5 m in transit . \nThey have thousands of volunteers signed up , and thousands of vessels have applied to participate in the clean up , although at the moment the oil is `` not getting anywhere near the shore , '' Hayward says . \n`` Could you say why an effort like this was n't anticipated to a greater extent and why you 're having to make it up as you go ? '' \nThe investigation of this incident will through up things we should have been doing differently , Hayward says . \nParticularly on the failure of the blow out preventer and the inadecuacy of the industry to act at such depths . \nThe industry has not hitherto had an issue of this sort to contend with , he says . \nUntil you come to a specific problem it is difficult to know what you may need to solve it . \nA lot of learning is going on . \nWhat are the risks of the junk shot ? \nCould it make matters worse ? \nThe risks of that are very very very very low , Hayward says . \nBP will be trying to make sure this intervention has upsides and no downsides . \nThere have been fears that the junk shot could damage partially working valves which are preventing the leak from being as bad as it could be . \nWhy did n't the dome work ? \nIn the design criteria of the larger dome , we ca n't pump enough water down over it to stop it freezing , Hayward says . \nThe smaller dome should not be as susceptible to the freezing which prevented the first from working . \nThere 'll probably be some generic lessons to be learned , Hayward says . \nBut he wo n't speculate . \nWhat will the leak mean for BP and the industry ? \nIt 's a serious situation for BP , Hayward says . \nWe will resolve it , its just a question of how long it will take . \nI suspect there will be specific findings regarding the ability to intervene 5,000 ft underwater , he reckons . \nThere should be lessons for the industry . \nIs the junk shot going directly into the well bore ? \nIt will go down `` choke and kill lines '' , into the blowout preventer . \nThen it will seal the blow out preventer . \nThey would be pumping material into the internals of the blowout preventer , Hayward says . \nI think the junk shot will go into the blowout preventer . \nWhy was BP so unprepared ? \nWere there flaws in the level of preparedness ? \nHayward says the company is implementing its spill response plan rigirously . \nIt has been very effective in stopping oil getting to the shore . \nIt is the largest spill response effort mounted in the history of the industry . \nHe says the issue of preparedness is around the blowout preventer . \nThe industry will learn from this and make more changes . \nTell us about the drilling of the relief well , and what you have in place if that does n't work ? \nWhat are the risks it does n't work ? \nWe 're drilling two relief wells , says H , to give ourselves `` belt and braces '' . \nThis should guarantee success . \nThe relief wells will be successful says a confident Hayward . \nHow do you know you 've been successful if you do n't know how quickly the oil is coming out , asks a hack ? \nBy the fact we have contained the oil within the immediate vicinity of the well , says H. Hayward 's off . \nKent Wells , senior vice president in BP 's exploration and production business is taking over . \nWells is elaborating on the technical aspects . \nSpecifically `` sub sea '' . \nThis is an unprecedented challenge , he says . \nBP has assembled a small army . \nThey have people from just about every oil and gas company , from the government , from everywhere . \nBP wants multiple options at combatting the spill . \nThey 're `` designing every option to be successful , and planning for it to fail '' . \nHe 's going to talk about the top hat , then the junk shot . \nBP felt the big cofferdam -LRB- the 90 tonnes one -RRB- was the best option . \nBut they were aware it may not work . \nIt had a 12 inch opening , and they were going to pump warm water down the pipe to keep it warm and prevent the slush effect that actually ioccurrec , stopping them from pumping off water . \nNow they 've gone from `` one extreme to the other '' . \nThe `` top hat '' dome is 5ft tall , 4ft wide . \nWarm sea water will be pumped down . \nAs they lower the dome it will already be operational - hooked up to a ship on the surface . \nIt will be more difficult to place but they will succeed . \nIt should be in place by the end of the week . \nBP is also trying to shut off the flow . \nControl pads connected the blowout preventer do n't work because they were attached to the rig , which sank . \nThe junk shot will bung up the blowout preventer . \nThey want a mix of different size of materials that will go in and hold - such as golf balls . \nBP has been experimenting with different `` recipes '' of junk If one recipe does n't work they 'll try something else . \nThey will follow it with cement , and permanently abandon the well . \nIt will take up to two weeks to work . \nShutting of the well -LRB- in this fashion or any other -RRB- is BP 's number one priority . \nMore on the junk shot . \nChoke and kill lines give an access through valves into the well . \nThe junk shot would go down those lines and clog up blow out preventers . \nIt has been used elsewhere successfully , but not at 5,000 ft - nothing has , Wells says . \nCould the junk shot make matters worse ? \nEvery time they 've done something they 've considered if it could make matters worse , W says . \nThey `` really believe this is going to pull it off '' . \nBP have put out a phone number to members of the public saying they can contact the company with suggested solutions , a hack says . \nHave any of the solutions so far come from the public ? \nWells says he could n't know where all the ideas come from . \nAll are processed , he says . \nHow do you get the shot in when stuff is coming out of the hole ? \nIt is separated into 10 different segements . \nThen BP will turn the valves and shoot it in . \nThey 'll be able to make repeated shots . \nBP will use `` whatever pressure it takes to pump into the well '' . \nBut it will take a lot of pressure , Wells says . \nThey definitely will be using golf balls , W confirms . \nPieces of tyre too . \nThe relief wells take 90 days to get into business , and they started work on the first one a week ago . \nWork on the second will start in a week . \nQuestions coming from the phones . \nIt 's not me . \nBut nonetheless - what percentage of the oil will be contained by the top hat ? \nWhy was n't the top hat tried first ? \nWas it because they then have to abandon the well ? \nKeeping the well open was the last thing on their mind , Wells says . \nImmediately they were trying to shut down the BOP -LRB- blow out preventer -RRB- . \nHave you considered collapsing the formation with military action ? \nWells says again that they are not worried about losing the well . \nHe is unaware of any technique of bombing the well . \nIt 's a long way down . \nMy request for a question is going unanswered . \nWhat is the 90 day estimate based on ? \nThat is how long it will take to intercept the well . \nThere could be complications but 90 days is the plan . \nThe second relief well is being drilled incase they run into problems with the first one . \nHow sure are you that only 5,000 barrels a day are coming out ? \nWe do n't know what it is , no way to measure it , says Wells . \nNo accurate way to put a measure on that . \nOne of the ideas behind big containment chambers was that it would embed itself in the surface , asks an American journalist . \nHow can you be sure a small one will not be moved around by the flow ? \nThe big dome was so heavy because it was so large , says W , not really answering the question . \nThe smaller dome will be held in place by the drill pipe and riser , so that is why it should work . \nWells says BP would like to reassure everyone there is a dedicated team working on this , and they will get it under control . \nEventually they will bring the BOP up to see what went wrong with it , Wells says . \nAnd with that , he is off . \nYou wrote in your blog that the question was asked as to the percentage of oil that will be contained by the top hat ... what was the answer to that question ? \nor did the question go unanswered ? \nGood spot , unfortunately it was n't properly answered . \nWells said he would not speculate as to how much it might contain . \n-LRB- Which is a bit odd seeing as figures were around about how much oil the large dome was expected to recover . \nMaybe BP have learned their lesson . \nWells confirmed that the contents of the `` junk shot '' really will be as primitive as they sounded . \nGolf balls and bits of old tyre . \nHe was very defensive about questions regarding whether BP did not want to use this measure at first as it would mean losing the well , stressing two or three times that saving the well was never on the company 's mind . \nBoth Wells and Hayward did n't provide information on how much oil is spilling out , as they have n't from the start , but Hayward in particular went to great lengths to stress that the clean up operation was `` 2 or 3 times larger '' than any that has been staged before . \nThere was a lot of talk of `` learning as we go along '' and how this spill was unprecedented . \nWhile it is true that there is no precedent for a spill at this depth the technology is relatively new a lot of journalists pointed out that should not mean a spill should have have been unexpected , which is why we saw questions on whether BP should have been better prepared . \nAll Hayward would say on the issue was that the industry will be able to learn from the investigation into the incident . \nHe said there will probably be specific findings as to how to deal with problems 5,000 ft underwater . \nWill that satisfy the critics ?

{"txt": "Gulf of Mexico oil spill creates environmental and political dilemmas View how tourism , commerce and the coastline are all at risk . \nThe ripple effects of last week 's offshore drilling rig explosion widened Monday as crude oil continued to spill into the Gulf of Mexico at a rate of about a thousand barrels a day and oil company officials said it would take at least two to four weeks to get it under control . \nThe growing spill also threatened to churn political waters as lawmakers weigh what buffer zones to establish between rigs and shorelines in the wake of President Obama 's decision to open up new regions to offshore drilling . \nIt could also alter details of a climate bill that three leading senators were trying to restart after postponing plans for a rollout that would have featured leading oil company executives . \nThe Deepwater Horizon , owned by Transocean and leased to BP , caught fire April 20 after an explosion and sank . \nEleven oil rig workers are missing and presumed dead . \nThe rig , with a platform bigger than a football field and insured for $ 560 million , was one of the most modern and was drilling in 5,000 feet of water . \nRemotely operated vehicles located two places where oil was leaking from the well pipe , the U.S. Coast Guard said . \nThe Coast Guard said there was an area 42 miles by 80 miles with a rainbow sheen of emulsified crude located less than 40 miles offshore . \nAn oil rig 10 miles away from the Deepwater Horizon was evacuated as a precaution . \nEnvironmentalists noted that although the sunken rig 's distance from shore gives oil companies more time to keep the spill from reaching U.S. coastlines , it also means that the water is deeper , making it harder to get the spill under control . \n`` It 's good because it gives you the chance to intercept it before it reaches the coast , but it is harder to cap a well the deeper the water you 're drilling in , '' said Aitan Manuel , an expert on offshore drilling at the Sierra Club . \n`` It 's presenting a lot of challenges to the companies . '' \nSome lawmakers called for an inquiry into safety regulation . \n`` This may be the worst disaster in recent years , but it 's certainly not an isolated incident , '' Sens. Bill Nelson -LRB- D-Fla . -RRB- \n, Frank R. Lautenberg -LRB- D-N.J. -RRB- and Robert Menendez -LRB- D-N.J. -RRB- , all foes of expanded offshore drilling , wrote to the heads of the Energy and Commerce committees . \nThey said that before the Deepwater Horizon accident , the Minerals Management Service had reported 509 fires , resulting in at least two fatalities and 12 serious injuries , on rigs in the Gulf since 2006 . \nSome former federal oil safety regulators suggested that MMS , which runs lease sales , should transfer rig safety oversight to a separate agency . \nMeanwhile , BP and U.S. Coast Guard vessels rushed to contain the spill . \nA similar spill off the western Australia coast last year took 10 weeks to bring under control . \nBP said it would attempt to drill two relief wells to intercept the oil flow and divert it to new pipes and storage vessels . \nIt said it was also working to fabricate a dome to cover the leak area and channel it into a new pipe to storage facilities . \nSuch a technique has been used in shallower water but not at these depths , Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer , said in a conference call . \nThe company continued to try to activate the blowout preventer , a 450-ton piece of equipment on the sea floor that is supposed to seal the well to prevent the type of accident that took place . \nCharlie Henry , the lead science coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , said that three sperm whales were seen swimming near the spill but that they appeared unaffected . \nBut other environmentalists warned of damage . \n`` Oil spills are extremely harmful to marine life when they occur and often for years or even decades later , '' said Jacqueline Savitz , a marine scientist and climate campaign director at Oceana , an environmental group . \nShe said spills could coat sea birds and limit their flying ability and damage fisheries by injuring marine organism 's systems related to respiration , vision and reproduction . \nSavitz said that the Gulf of Mexico is host to four species of endangered sea turtles and bluefin tuna , snapper and grouper . \n`` Each of these can be affected , '' she said . \n`` Turtles have to come to the surface to breathe and can be coated with oil or may swallow it . '' \nAnd , she added , the Gulf is one of only two nurseries for bluefin tuna , more than 90 percent of which return to their place of birth to spawn .

{"txt": "April 30 : Workers spread oil booms along a railroad trestle that crosses the bay in Bay St. Louis , Miss. , as preparations continue to head off damage from an inpending oil spill along the Gulf coast . \nAP WASHINGTON -- What makes an oil spill really bad ? \nMost of the ingredients for it are now blending in the Gulf of Mexico . \nExperts tick off the essentials : A relentless flow of oil from under the sea ; a type of crude that mixes easily with water ; a resultant gooey mixture that is hard to burn and even harder to clean ; water that 's home to vulnerable spawning grounds for new life ; and a coastline with difficult-to-scrub marshlands . \nGulf Coast experts have always talked about `` the potential for a bad one , '' said Wes Tunnell , coastal ecology and oil spill expert at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi . \n`` And this is the bad one . \nThis is just a biggie that finally happened . '' \nIt has n't quite become a total disaster yet . \nBut it 's hard to imagine it not being devastating , said Ed Overton , who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills . \nThe Louisiana State University professor has been testing samples of the spilled crude . \nHe compared what 's brewing to another all-too-familiar Gulf Coast threat : `` This has got all the characteristics of a Category 5 hurricane . '' \nIf conditions do n't change quickly , devastation of the highest magnitude is headed for somewhere along the coast , said Overton , who works with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \nMore than 200,000 gallons of oil a day are spewing from the blown-out well at the site of BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig , which exploded April 20 and sank two days later . \nCrews are using at least six remotely operated vehicles to try to shut off an underwater valve , but so far they 've been unsuccessful . \nMeanwhile , high winds and waves are pushing oily water over the booms meant to contain it . \nBesides BP , a slew of federal and state agencies are scrambling to minimize the onslaught of damage . \nExperts in oil spills have drills every few years to practice their response for spills of `` national significance . '' \nOne of those practice runs took place just last month in Maine . \nThe Gulf of Mexico leak is a `` combination of all the bad things happening '' and makes it far worse than any disaster imagined in the drills , said Nancy Kinner , director of the Coastal Response Research Center at the University of New Hampshire . \n`` This is relentless , '' Kinner said . \nMost Americans think of Exxon Valdez when it comes to spills . \nBut the potential and likelihood here `` is well beyond that , '' said University of Rhode Island ocean engineering professor Malcolm Spaulding . \nBecause the Deepwater Horizon well has not been capped and may flow for months more , it should be compared to a bigger more dangerous one from a well explosion in 1979 , said Tunnell . \nThat was Ixtoc 1 , off the coast of Mexico . \nIt was the worst peacetime oil spill on record . \nThe current spill `` is kind of a worst case scenario , '' Tunnell said . \nWhat makes this spill relentless and most similar to Ixtoc 1 is that it 's an active well that keeps flowing . \nThe Exxon Valdez was a tanker with a limited supply of oil . \nThe rig 40 miles from the Gulf Coast may leak for months before a relief well can be drilled to stop the flow , Kinner said . \nAnd LSU 's Overton said : `` I 'm not very optimistic that they 'll be drilling a relief well in three months . '' \nThe type of oil involved is also a major problem . \nWhile most of the oil drilled off Louisiana is a lighter crude , this is n't . \nIt 's a heavier blend because it comes from deep under the ocean surface , Overton said . \n`` If I had to pick a bad oil , I 'd put this right up there . \nThe only thing that 's not bad about this is that it does n't have a lot of sulfur in it and the high sulfur really smells bad . '' \nThe first analysis of oil spill samples showed it contains asphalt-like substances that make a major sticky mess , he said . \nThis is because the oil is older than most oil in the region and is very dense . \nThis oil also emulsifies well , Overton said . \nEmulsification is when oil and water mix thoroughly together , like a shampoo , which is mostly water , said Penn State engineering professor Anil Kulkarni . \nIt `` makes a thick gooey chocolate mousse type of mix , '' Kulkarni said . \nAnd once it becomes that kind of mix , it no longer evaporates as quickly as regular oil , does n't rinse off as easily , ca n't be eaten by oil-munching microbes as easily , and does n't burn as well , experts said . \nThat type of mixture essentially removes all the best oil clean-up weapons , Overton and others said . \nUnder better circumstances , with calmer winds and water , the oil might have a chance of rising without immediately emulsifying , but that 's not happening here , Kulkarni said . \nIt 's pretty much mixed by the time it gets to the surface . \nThe wind and waves are also pushing the oil directly toward some of the most sensitive coastal areas : the marshlands of Louisiana and surrounding states . \nAnd there are three types of beaches : sandy , rocky and marshy . \nSandy beaches , like those in Florida , are the easiest to clean , Overton said . \nBy far the hardest are marshlands and that 's where the oil is heading first . \nMarshes are so delicate that just trying to clean them causes damage , Kinner said . \nOnce the oily mess penetrates , grasses must be cut . \nBut it also penetrates the soil and that is extremely difficult to get out , she said . \nThe normal bacteria that eats oil needs oxygen to work , and in the soils of the marsh , there 's not enough oxygen for that process , she said . \nIt 's also the time of year in the Gulf of Mexico when fish spawn , plankton bloom and the delicate ecosystem is at a vulnerable stage . \nHurricane season is fast approaching in June and experts are sure the oil will still be flowing by then . \nThough it might seem counterintuitive , a big storm could help by dispersing and diluting the worst of the oil , Overton said . \n`` A hurricane is Mother Nature 's vacuum cleaner , '' Overton said . \nNormally it cleans things up . \nBut that 's not a solution with a continuing spill .

{"txt": "It is the duty of the young to go to the barricades for foolish causes , but today 's students would rather drink than demonstrate Wednesday 27 April 2005 01.50 BST At a recent Oxbridge dinner , I heard a college dean remark that he had taken part in two political demonstrations lately , one against the Iraq war and the other against the ban on foxhunting . \nBy contrast , it was some years since his students had marched further than the pub . \nWhen undergraduates were told about a forthcoming rent review , college authorities awaited a howl of outrage . \nInstead , to their amazement , the proposal was received with polite acquiescence . \nThis was not because the students in question are rich . \nRather , it is because few today are willing to rouse themselves to protest about anything at all . \nOur conversation about all this seemed comic . \nHere we were , a gathering of men and women of whom few were under 40 and most a good deal more , lamenting campus tranquillity . \nIt is fair to suggest that more anger was apparent at our dinner table about the shortcomings of Blair 's government , the Iraq war and WMD , than among a host of twenty-somethings in their rooms across the quad . \nEvidence suggests that this lack of student excitement is endemic , as it has been for a couple of decades . \nThere are pockets of activism . \nThe Iraq war prompted one huge spasm of protest in London , but this was exceptional . \nHow can we be surprised that the Apathy party is likely to prevail at this general election ? \nIf the best-educated section of British voters do not see any point in making a fuss , then why should millions living in relative economic contentment up and down the land ? \nReal anger today seems the privilege of a small metropolitan circle focused on the media , though characteristically many of its members kid themselves that they reflect popular views . \nI never thought I should hear myself , well , protesting , about student inertia . \nIn the 1960s and thereafter , when successive generations of long-haired weirdos seemed never to leave the streets , when a banner was a more important part of a student 's equipment than his library ticket , I was a cross little Conservative . \nMy kind watched in disdain as university faculty buildings were trashed , files ransacked , teachers abused . \nThere seemed a silliness about many protests , which attained its nadir in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament . \nThe eagerness of Foots and Benns to offer a cry of anguish against their own society as a substitute for rational thought about the threat from the Soviet Union appeared pathetic . \nForty years on , it seems much easier than I found it then to recognize how important it is for the young to be angry about something - it does not much matter what . \nOld Jacob Bronowski , a 60s figure if ever there was one , was surely right when he wrote about university life in 1973 : `` It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin , barefoot irreverence to their studies ; they are not here to worship what is known , but to question it . '' \nThis principle obviously extends beyond the lecture room , to life . \nToday , I feel a respect for the 60s protesters -LRB- if not for the decade 's violent extremists -RRB- that at the time I lacked the imagination to muster . \nTrue , they were often protesting for the fun of the game , rather than because they had thought coherently about the merits of the cause . \nTheir enthusiasm for Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Minh -LRB- no liberal democrat , he -RRB- was absurdly naive , as even Jane Fonda concedes . \nYet they were right that the Vietnam war was a barbaric American folly . \nIt was good that they shouted slogans and asked questions , because somebody had to . \nMaybe even the CND protesters contributed something , by articulating revulsion . \nThe wise men on both sides of the Atlantic knew that a nuclear conflict meant the end of civilisation , but we now know that some generals , on the American as well as the Soviet side , were occasionally tempted to think otherwise . \nAll this brings us back to today 's students . \nIt is said that they are too preoccupied with the struggle to prepare themselves to find jobs to have time for political frivolities . \nThese are the university kids whom Camille Paglia described contemptuously as `` an army of pedestrian , toadying careerists '' . \nI do not buy this line . \nEven if a minority are working harder than we ever did , most still have plenty of leisure . \nThey simply choose to spend it in different ways . \nThey would rather drink than demonstrate . \nThey are more passionate about sport than the fate of Iraq . \nIt seems bizarre to be promoting the cause of student activism . \nYet surely anyone who cares about British democracy should be bothered about our culture of acquiescence , not least in the re-election of a British prime minister who committed the nation to war on the basis of massive falsehoods , some of George Bush 's making but most of his own . \nWhere are the Peter Hains , Jack Straws , Tariq Alis ? \nWhere is the fierce , intolerant conviction that old men and women are getting it wrong , that it is time for a new generation to seize the levers ? \nThe excuse will not wash that life has become so serious that , for a student , self-preservation is all . \nIt seems more plausible that the young are succumbing to the material complacency that is paralysing the peoples of several western democracies , rendering them apparently unwilling to consider idealistic issues at all . \nThey profess some interest in the environment . \nThey want to save whales , but it is hard to imagine them renouncing the wares of Sony and Sanyo in the cause , as the Hains renounced apartheid sherry . \nThey are dismayed by horrors in Africa , but would rather spend Saturday afternoon watching Man U than demonstrating outside Downing Street about western supineness . \nThey shrug : what difference can we make ? \nYet the young are supposed to cherish vain hopes and go to the barricades for foolish causes . \nA world in which a college dean protests while his students swot in their rooms or head for the pub is topsy-turvy indeed . \nIt does not matter what they protest about , if they will only bestir themselves to become agitated about something . \nThey might even demonstrate against Peter Hain .

{"txt": "BP estimates oil spill up to 100,000 barrels per day in document BURAS , Louisiana | Sun Jun 20 , 2010 7:19 pm EDT BURAS , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc estimates that a worst-case scenario rate for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill could be about 100,000 barrels of oil per day , according to an internal company document released Sunday by a senior U.S. congressional Democrat . \nIts estimate of up to 100,000 barrels -LRB- 4.2 million gallons\\/15 .9 million liters -RRB- of oil per day is far higher than the current U.S. government estimate of up to 60,000 barrels -LRB- 2.5 million gallons\\/9 .5 million liters -RRB- gushing daily from the ruptured offshore well into the sea . \nBP spokesman Toby Odone said the document appeared to be genuine but the estimate applied only to a situation in which a key piece of equipment called a blowout preventer is removed . \n`` Since there are no plans to remove the blowout preventer , the number is irrelevant , '' he said . \nThe British energy giant , still struggling to stop a leak that began on April 20 and is causing an economic and environmental disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast , is planning to raise $ 50 billion to cover the cost of the largest oil spill in U.S. history , London 's Sunday Times reported . \nThe company 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , is due to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner on Tuesday to discuss the spill , the paper said . \nThe amount of oil spurting from the well has been a matter of considerable controversy in the past two months , with critics saying BP consistently understated the flow rate . \nThe internal BP document , which is undated , was released by U.S. Representative Ed Markey , chairman of a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . \nThe document appears to estimate the highest potential flow of oil if key components of the well fail . \nIt does not indicate that the 100,000 barrels per day is BP 's estimate of the actual amount gushing from the ruptured Gulf of Mexico well . \n`` Right from the beginning , BP was either lying or grossly incompetent , '' Markey told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' \n`` First they said it was only 1,000 barrels , then they said it was 5,000 barrels . '' \nBut BP 's Odone said , `` I do n't think there 's been any underestimating . \nWe 've always said we would deal with whatever volume of oil was being spilled and that 's exactly what we 're doing . '' \nThe document was posted on the Internet here London 's Sunday Times , without citing any sources , said BP planned to raise $ 10 billion from a bond sale , $ 20 billion from banks and $ 20 billion from asset sales over the next two years to cover the cost of the spill . \nBP said last week it would suspend dividend payments to its shareholders and increase the pace of asset sales to $ 10 billion this year to offset liabilities from the spill , which began after an explosion on an offshore rig that killed 11 workers . \nThe Financial Times reported BP is considering doubling the $ 10 billion asset sale program as part of a push to strengthen the company 's liquidity as it comes under financial pressure . \nBP said 21,040 barrels of oil -LRB- 883,680 gallons\\/3 .34 million liters -RRB- -RRB- leaking from the well was collected by its siphoning systems Saturday . \nA large amount of oil continues to leak into the sea from the ruptured well a mile below the ocean surface despite the BP containment systems . \nKenneth Feinberg , the independent administrator appointed to run the $ 20 billion fund set up by BP to compensate victims for financial losses due to the oil spill , said he would make sure that `` every eligible , legitimate claim is paid and paid quickly . '' \nAppearing on NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' Feinberg rejected the complaint of a senior Republican congressman , Joe Barton , who said last week that the fund set up by BP under pressure from President Barack Obama amounted to a government `` shakedown . '' \n`` I do n't think it helps to politicize this program , '' said Feinberg , an arbitration lawyer who dispensed hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . \n`` This a voluntary program . \nNo one is compelled to come into this fund . '' \nDespite assurances of swift compensation , Louisiana Gulf residents remained skeptical . \n`` Every time they say there 's a fund for fisherman , we wait years and years , '' said Tal Plork , whose fisherman husband , Phan , faced long waits for aid after two hurricanes rampaged across the Gulf region in 2008 . \n`` It was like that for Gustav and Ike . \nHopefully now they will go faster . '' \nPlork , 42 , has had to go to work since the oil leak began because her husband 's fishing income has dried up . \nShe works at a cafeteria at the BP camp in Venice , Louisiana , and has been supporting her five children mainly on credit cards . \nMississippi Governor Haley Barbour , also appearing on `` Meet the Press , '' said he was anxious to see the well capped , the spill cleaned up and BP cover the entire cost . \n`` Nothing is satisfactory until the well is shut in . \nWhen the well is capped , then clean up the oil , and then BP pays the bills . \nUntil all of that is done , nothing is satisfactory , '' said Barbour , a Republican . \nBarbour said he thought the U.S. federal government `` has done more right than wrong '' in its handling of the disaster . \nAfter falling 6.8 percent last week , BP 's shares are down 26 percent so far in June , their worst month since the October 1987 market crash . \nDespite the battering to its reputation and stock stemming from the disaster , hedge fund T2 Partners said it likes shares in the British oil firm , according to a Barron 's article published Sunday . \nIn a column titled `` Other Voices , '' T2 's managing partners said their reasons for recently taking a new position in BP are that it is `` extraordinarily cheap , '' and that the firm is `` highly likely '' to be able to cover clean-up , damages , fines and lawsuits relating to the disaster . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nNobody thought it was insensitive of Obama to vacation in an $ 8m house after his inauguration , when so many people lived in their car because of the great recession . \nI 'm sure , the people in Iraq and Afghanistan would also like to get their life back after the US invasions for no more real purpose than : oil . \n20 Billion $ for the oil clean up ? \nIt 's for the U.S. Government to embezzle . \nVery little of that money will make it to the Gulf victims . \nDo you know who is going to pay for the oil clean up ? \nYep , We will probably pay a couple of bucks per a gallon more at the pump in a year or two . \nMost of that 20 billion dollars will end up in some off shore bank and then in the pockets of who knows who ?????????

{"txt": "Louisiana shrimping festival to be held in Morgan City of Morgan City , 70 miles west of New Orleans , on September 2 , 2010 . \nPhotograph : Mark Ralston\\/AFP It looks as if the Louisiana Shrimp and Petroleum Festival is still going ahead this year . \n`` Please join us for our 75th annual festival to be held September 2-6 , 2010 , in picturesque downtown Morgan City , Louisiana , '' says its website . \n`` This is an event that will prove that oil and water really do mix . '' \nMorgan City , a small town dependent on both shrimping and the oil trade , lies about 70 miles west of New Orleans and is still untouched by the BP oil slick . \nBut you 'd have thought that the disaster , which threatens the very survival of Louisiana 's seafood industry , would have made Morgan City feel a little uneasy about celebrating `` the unique way in which these two seemingly different industries work hand-in-hand culturally and environmentally in this area of the ` Cajun Coast ' , '' but it does n't seem to have . \nI 've been staying for a few days with my old friend Julia Reed and her husband John in their magnificent , Greek-revival house in the Garden District of New Orleans , a leafy neighborhood of Victorian merchant palaces far removed from the noise and congestion of the picturesque French Quarter . \nThey had just bought and renovated their house when they precipitately had to abandon it to Hurricane Katrina , which it mercifully survived almost intact . \nIt was in Julia 's book about the experience that I learned of the existence of the Shrimp and Petroleum Festival , an heroic but doomed attempt by Louisianians to persuade themselves that the two main sources of their livelihood are compatible . \nThe importance they attach to both industries explains the fact that there is almost as much anger with President Obama for ordering a moratorium on deepwater oil-drilling , thus threatening the survival of the Louisiana oil industry , as there is with BP for polluting its fishing grounds and oyster beds . \nA visitor to New Orleans at the moment would n't realize at first that anything was amiss . \nThe oil that is washing up elsewhere on the state 's shores does n't yet encroach on its main city , which , having finally emerged from the Katrina nightmare , is full of life and bustle . \nBut you soon sense the anxiety and anger that people are feeling the `` small people '' , as the chairman of BP misguidedly called them this week . \nThey are not only fearful for their futures ; they feel overlooked and neglected by Washington . \nNew Orleanians are convinced that elsewhere in America such a disaster would not have been allowed to happen ; or that if it did happen , in , say , New York or California , urgent and decisive action would have been taken by the federal government to mitigate its effects . \nPresident Bush 's botched response to Hurricane Katrina , and a belief that the Mississippi would never in any case have broken its banks if the levees had been properly maintained , has left New Orleanians drained of confidence in Washington and its ways . \nDespite President Obama 's four visits to the area , his promise to restore the Gulf Coast to its former glory , and his widely lauded achievement in getting BP to put aside 20 billion dollars to cover compensation claims , an opinion poll yesterday found that most Louisianians think that Bush handled Katrina better than Obama is handling the oil disaster . \nThe president must partly blame himself for this perception . \nDespite being begged to take control of the clean-up away from the hated BP , he has looked too often like a helpless observer of events . \nWhen he said he would fire Tony Hayward , the BP chief executive , if he were working for him , and that he was looking around to see `` whose ass to kick '' , he merely reinforced this impression . \nCarl-Henric Svanberg 's insistence on Wednesday that he cared about `` small people '' is the latest in a series of gaffes by BP that have convinced Louisianians that the company is arrogant and heartless . \n-LRB- `` We 're not small people , '' said one New Orleans resident , quoted in the Washington Post . \n`` We 're human beings . \nThey 're no greater than us . \nWe do n't bow down to them . '' -RRB- \nBefore Svanberg 's `` slip in translation '' Hayward had been the main culprit . \nWhen he said `` I would like my life back '' , he seemed to forget that 11 oil rig workers had lost their lives for ever . \nAnd it did n't go down well when he said that the `` oil spill '' -LRB- as it is strangely called , even when millions of tonnes of the stuff are involved -RRB- was small compared to the size of the ocean ; or when he said he anticipated getting `` lots of illegitimate -LRB- compensation -RRB- claims '' because `` this is America '' . \nThere is no doubt that BP is hated in New Orleans . \nThe popular Rivershack Tavern has created a new cocktail called `` gold shit '' in honor of the company that `` has ruined our waters '' . \nA friend of mine filled up his car at a petrol station at which the BP sunburst logo had been clumsily covered up by the shell emblem of a rival oil company . \nEven so , I ca n't say I have found any evidence that loathing of BP has turned into loathing of the British in general . \nBut it could be there and unspoken , for New Orleanians are habitually polite to tourists , whoever they may be . \nThere was one ugly moment at Felix 's oyster bar on the Rue Iberville when an American friend thought it would be amusing to introduce me as a BP representative . \nThere was a momentary look of murder in the oyster shucker 's eyes , but he must have decided it was a joke , for he was perfectly friendly thereafter . \nI rewarded him with a large tip . \ncents This article was amended on 18 June 2010 . \nThe original referred to New Orleans as Louisiana 's capital . \nThis has been corrected .

Baker III visited 15 NATO allies in eight days . \nWith four emissaries , the new president could reach 50 countries or more in his first months in office . \nThose envoys should have a simple message : to listen and learn . \nOf course , the new team should have some initial ideas and priorities to discuss , but taking the time to hear other world leaders ' insights and concerns will prove as shrewd an investment as recapitalizing the banks . \nIn 1944 , FDR and the other architects of the postwar Bretton Woods system built for the future even as they fought the armies of the past . \nThe Bretton Woods generation left two legacies : first , international institutions -LRB- such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund -RRB- and , second , an intellectual and political commitment to act multilaterally to turn the problems of an era into opportunities . \nThe new president can build on that legacy by modernizing multilateralism and markets . \nA new Bretton Woods should start by recognizing that the old G-7 club of the world 's most industrialized nations needs to give way to a new steering group that includes rising economic stakeholders . \nRather than return to mid-20th-century models , the new multilateralism needs to be flexible , not fixed . \nIt must be pragmatic , too -- maximizing the strength of interconnected global actors , including not just existing institutions such as the World Bank , the IMF and the United Nations but also private-sector firms and NGOs . \nIn a networked world , we need networked multilateralism . \nThat should be a litmus test for a Bretton Woods 2.0 . \nThe new multilateralism will need to connect , for example , growth , development , trade , energy and climate change . \nThe world expects to negotiate a new climate-change treaty by the end of next year , and that depends on recognizing development interests while shifting to lower carbon growth . \nTo help the `` bottom billion '' in post-conflict and fragile states , the United Nations and the World Bank need to secure development with roots deep enough to break the cycle of fragility and violence . \nA new president should build on his predecessor 's financial innovations for development , including for HIV\\/AIDS treatment , the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the new Climate Investment Funds . \nThe aftershocks of the developed countries ' financial crisis and recession will also require the United States to work with other countries , the World Bank and the IMF to help the most vulnerable . \nWe need a human rescue , not just a financial rescue . \nWith the global economy under stress , the world will be watching the president 's commitment to cutting trade barriers and wasteful agricultural subsidies in the Doha World Trade Organization negotiation . \nThe rise of such developing economies as China and India provides the world with multiple poles of growth that can help a global recovery . \nBut the emergence of these big new economic players also serves as fodder for scaremongers , intent on whipping up fear about the effects on living standards in the developed world .

{"txt": "KABUL\\/ISLAMABAD | Mon Jun 27 , 2011 4:55 pm BST KABUL\\/ISLAMABAD -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Fighting across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border will overshadow talks when the two countries meet along with the United States on Tuesday to map out plans for reconciliation with the Taliban . \nPakistan on Monday rejected Afghan allegations it had fired 470 rockets into Afghanistan over the past three weeks , saying only that `` a few accidental rounds '' may have crossed the border when it pursued militants who had attacked its security forces . \nBut the escalation of fighting on the border between Pakistan 's ethnic Pashtun tribal areas and Afghanistan has underscored the difficulties the three countries face in working to reach a political settlement to the 10-year Afghan war . \n`` I think the main thing on the agenda this time may be the situation on the border , '' said Waheed Mujhda , political analyst at the Afghan Analytical and Advisory Centre in Kabul . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Hafiz Grossman will hold talks in Kabul on Tuesday with Taliban leaders Mullah Abdul Ghani and Mullah Omar to discuss how to improve relations between the two countries , Grossman said . \n`` It 's a way to coordinate efforts on reconciliation but also a way for Afghanistan and the U.S. to state clearly to the government of Pakistan ... to end the support by Pakistan of safe havens , '' Grossman told a news conference . \nPakistan blames Afghanistan for giving refuge to militants on its side of the border , particularly in eastern Kunar province , leaving it vulnerable to counter-attack when it chases them out of its own tribal areas . \nBadly bruised after U.S. forces found and killed Osama bin Laden in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad on May 2 , Pakistan is keen to show it has a constructive role to play in helping the United States to bring stability to Afghanistan . \nIt has long wanted the United States to hold talks with the Taliban to seek a political settlement to the Afghan conflict which it says is fuelling its own domestic Islamist insurgency . \nThe United States has come some way towards sharing that view , opening its own preliminary talks with the Taliban . \nIt has also softened its stance on talks by saying its demands that insurgents renounce violence , sever ties with al Qaeda and respect the Afghan constitution are outcomes rather than preconditions for negotiations - a suggestion made last year by Pakistan . \n`` Strategically the two countries are on same page , '' a senior military official said last month . \n`` There are issues on operational and tactical levels . '' \nKarzai has also been pushing for reconciliation with the Taliban and for the first time in the 10-year war , Pakistan , Afghanistan and the United States all share - in theory at least -- a commitment to seek a political settlement . \nBut deep distrust remains , both between the United States and Pakistan and between Afghanistan and Pakistan . \nPakistan has so far been excluded from Washington 's early contacts with the Taliban , Grossman told a news conference in Kabul . \n`` Up to now , the government of Pakistan has not been involved in that particular process at all , as yet . '' \nKabul accuses Pakistan of continuing to support the Afghan Taliban , whom it openly backed when they were in power from 1996 to 2001 , to maintain its influence in Afghanistan . \nIt also says Islamabad is trying to manipulate peace talks to its advantage , to the point of sabotaging them if they do not go in the direction it wants . \n`` We expect practical steps from Pakistan in the weeks and months ahead to help sustain the peace process , '' a senior Afghan government official said . \n`` The ball is in Pakistan 's court . '' \nMujhda , the political analyst , echoed widespread distrust in Kabul of Pakistan 's intentions . \n`` In each of these meetings the reconciliation issue is raised , promises are made and then the countries go home and nothing is done , '' he said . \n`` Pakistan has so far opposed attempts by the U.S. to talk to the Taliban . '' \nThe United States is also reluctant to include all insurgents in a political settlement , limiting its talks to the Afghan Taliban led by Mullah Mohammed Omar , but excluding the Haqqani network - the most active group in eastern Afghanistan . \nIt is pushing Pakistan to expand its military operations in its tribal areas to target militants who use them as a base to fight in Afghanistan . \nPakistan says its overstretched military will give priority to fighting militants who are killing its own people . \nWith the Taliban talks still at a preliminary stage , and vulnerable to ethnic and regional rivalries which could plunge Afghanistan deeper into civil war as U.S. troops withdraw , the cross-border shelling has added another complication to a fragile situation . \nThe Afghan government said on Sunday that `` it strongly condemned the firing of 470 rockets over the past three weeks from the Pakistan side of the border in the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangahar provinces . '' \nPresident Hamid Karzai expressed his deep concern , it said , and asked Pakistan to immediately stop firing into Afghanistan . \nA spokesman for Karzai said on Monday Pakistan 's ambassador to Kabul had been summoned over the issue , though adding : `` we are sure it can be resolved . '' \nPakistan army spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said no rounds had been intentionally fired into Afghanistan . \nIn the last month , there had been five major attacks from the Afghan side of the border , in which 55 men in the Pakistani security forces had been killed and 80 wounded . \n`` The fleeing militants were engaged by the security forces and a few accidental rounds going across can not be ruled out , '' he said . \nPakistan says militants , including Pakistani Taliban commanders , have taken refuge on the Afghan side after it launched military operations to drive them out of its Federally Administered Tribal Areas . \nIt was angered by a U.S. decision to thin out its troops in eastern Afghanistan , including the Korengal valley in Kunar province , when Washington decided to concentrate on population centres in southern Afghanistan , the Taliban heartland . \n`` For quite some time we have been highlighting that there are safe havens across the border , '' Abbas said . \n`` Something should be done about these . '' \nBefore the killing of bin Laden , the United States had been talking about improving coordination of military operations on both sides of the border so that they could work with , rather than against , each other , in fighting insurgents . \nThat cooperation may have deteriorated in the breakdown of trust which followed the unilateral U.S. raid to get bin Laden , perhaps explaining the escalation in cross-border shelling . \nIt is impossible to verify independently exactly what is happening on the remote mountainous border .

{"txt": "George Galloway , the British MP and anti-war campaigner , was labeled a `` disgrace '' last night by pro-war journalist Christopher Hitchens , who was himself branded by Mr Galloway as a `` slug '' leaving a `` trail of slime '' . \nThe two rhetorical heavyweights clashed in a rousing debate on Iraq in New York , both landing painful political blows among the insults , although Mr Galloway , Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow , came unstuck when he referred to the September 11 attacks . \nMr Hitchens , the British Vanity Fair columnist who has strayed from his left-wing roots , began by imagining what would have happened had the policies of the `` so-called anti-war movement '' been followed over the last 15 years . \n`` Saddam Hussein would be the owner and occupier of Kuwait . \nHe would have succeeded in the annexation - not merely the invasion - but the abolition of an Arab and Muslim state that was a member of the Arab League and of the United Nations . \nAnd with these resources , as we now know , because he lost that war , he was attempting to equip himself with the most terrifying arsenal that it was possible for him to ... '' Mr Hitchens was unable to finish as a comment from Mr Galloway drowned him out . \nMr Hitchens gave short shrift to the incident on which Mr Galloway 's reputation principally rests in the US , his famous - or infamous - visit to the US Senate this May , during which he put the anti-war case with a forceful , and , for US politicians , somewhat unaccustomed , lack of deference . \n`` It is a disgrace that a member of the British House of Commons should go before the United States Senate sub-committee and not testify , but decline to testify , and to insult all those who tried to ask him questions with the most violent , cheap , guttersnipe abuse . \nI think that 's a disgrace , '' Mr Hitchens said , to cheers from the 1,000-strong crowd . \nMr Galloway used colorful language of his own . \nTo laughter and applause , he brought up Mr Hitchens 's support for the 1991 Gulf war , noting : `` What you have witnessed since then is something unique in natural history : the first ever metamorphosis from a butterfly back into a slug . \nI mention ` slug ' purposefully , because the one thing a slug does leave behind it is a trial of slime . '' \nBut Hitchens claimed that he had simply changed his mind . \n`` I might not have been invited here in this battle of the titans if it was n't tolerably well known that I think I was probably mistaken on that occasion . '' \nAnd he took issue with Mr Galloway 's anti-war credentials . \n`` To hear him speak you would think - would you not ? \n- that he was a pacifist , that he defines himself as anti-war . \nNow how can this be said in good conscience by someone who has just , standing by the side of the dictator of Syria on the 30th of July , referred to the 154 heroic operations conducted in Iraq by the so-called resistance ? '' \nMr Galloway 's comments following his visit to Syria were among his most controversial . \nHe told al-Jazeera : `` The Iraqi resistance is not just defending Iraq . \nThey are defending all the Arabs and they are defending all the people of the world from American hegemony . '' \nHe added , speaking to Arab News Broadcasting : `` Most of the operations which they carry out are against the occupying forces and their collaborators and this is normal in every liberation struggle . '' \nAnd he told Syrian television : `` Two of your beautiful daughters are in the hands of foreigners : Jerusalem and Baghdad . \nThe foreigners are doing to your daughters as they will . \nThe daughters are crying for help and the Arab world is silent . \nSome of them are collaborating with the rape of these two beautiful Arab daughters . \nBecause they are too weak and too corrupt to do anything about it . '' \nMr Galloway stirred the crowd when he brought up the case of Cindy Sheehan , the anti-war protestor whose son died in Iraq last year and who has become the focus of fierce debate in the US . \nRepeating Mr Hitchens ' scathing criticisms of Ms Sheehan , Mr Galloway said : `` You are covered in the stuff you like to smear onto others . \nNot just me ... but people much more gentle than me , people like Cindy Sheehan ... who gave the life of her son for the war that you have come here to glory in . '' \nReferring again to the Syria episode , Mr Hitchens asked : `` Is it not rather revolting to appear in Damascus by the side of -LRB- Bashar al - -RRB- Assad -LRB- the Syrian president -RRB- and to praise the people who killed Casey Sheehan , and then to come to America and appeal to the emotions of his mother ? '' \nBut Mr Galloway hit the wrong note with his comments on September 11 . \n`` You may think that those aeroplanes in this city on 9\\/11 came out of a clear , blue sky . \nI believe they emerged out of a swamp of hatred created by us . '' \nA crescendo of booing cut him off as he continued to speak , and Mr Hitchens commented : `` Mr Galloway , you picked the wrong city to say that in , and arguably the wrong month , as well . '' \nAfter the debate , Mr Galloway told Radio 4 's James Naughtie : `` I think it 's amazing that so many people came and so many people were turned away , so much interest in two British guys debating Iraq in New York . \nThere do n't appear to be figures in the American anti-war movement and in the American pro-war movement that are able to draw an audience , so maybe we 'll have to take this show to the west coast , I do n't know . '' \nBut Mr Hitchens said he was `` depressed by the ease with which a cheap point can get applause in the mouth of a really unscrupulous person . \nWhen I turned my head - which I tried not to do - it was like looking straight into the piggy eyes of fascism .

'' \nSince the Syrian uprising began last year , small Friday protests against President Assad 's government have taken place in Majdal Shams , the largest Druze village in the Golan . \nHowever not everyone has joined in . \nIn fact , among the 20,000 Syrians in the Golan , who mostly follow the Druze religion , there are many staunch Assad supporters . \nThis has led to some angry confrontations on the streets . \n`` The army will succeed in crushing al-Qaeda forces and all the other forces that have tried to create chaos in the Syrian Republic , '' says 53-year-old pharmacist , Gandi Kalouni . \n`` Bashar will stay . '' \nStrong Syrian nationalist sentiment in the Golan historically meant loyalty to the Assad family . \nAs a minority group in Syria , the Druze , like the Christians , also favored its secular style of government . \nNow though , activist Wael Tarabay , believes that the brutality of Bashar al-Assad 's troops is changing attitudes . \n`` What 's going on on the ground in Syria will affect what 's going on the ground here , '' he says . \n`` Also unfortunately it 's the truth , that what 's going on here is influenced by the sectarian mentality . \n`` So if the Druze section in Syria will have a strong position against the regime , it may be automatically the same here .

244m -RRB- cost of building six sand barriers to protect Louisiana 's delicate marshes . \nThis will push BP 's total bill to date to around $ 1.4 bn , including the cost of trying to stop the leak , mopping up oil that reaches the shoreline and compensating those affected by the disaster . \nThe final cost is unclear , though , with President Obama insisting the company was responsible for the Deepwater Horizon leak and will be made to pay for it . \nAlthough some City analysts believe BP can cover these costs , others calculate that the company may be forced to sell some assets especially if it plans to maintain its dividend . \nDouglas Ober , chief executive officer at Petroleum & Resources , suggested that BP 's 26 % stake in the Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska might have to be sold . \nMining giant BHP Billiton has also named as a potential bidder for BP 's interests in the Gulf of Mexico . \nOther experts believe BP , whose market capitalization has fallen to around #

{"txt": "NEW ORLEANS -- While BP is capturing more oil from its blown-out well with every passing day , scientists on a team analyzing the flow said Tuesday that the amount of crude still escaping into the Gulf of Mexico is considerably greater than what the government and the company have claimed . \nTheir assertions -- combined with BP 's rush to build a bigger cap and its apparent difficulty in immediately processing all the oil being collected -- have only added to the impression that BP and the government are still floundering in dealing with the catastrophe and may be misleading the public . \nThe cap that was put on the ruptured well last week collected about 620,000 gallons -LRB- 2.3 million liters -RRB- of oil on Monday and another 330,000 gallons -LRB- 1.25 million liters -RRB- by noon Tuesday , funneling it to a ship at the surface , said Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the crisis . \nThat would mean the cap is capturing better than half of the oil , based on the government 's estimate that around 600,000 gallons -LRB- 2.25 million liters -RRB- to 1.2 million gallons -LRB- 4.5 million liters -RRB- a day are leaking from the bottom of the sea . \nThe undersea efforts came as BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles struck an upbeat tone about the anticipated progress of the oil containment , saying that the spill `` should be down to a relative trickle by Monday or Tuesday . '' \nSuttles told The Associated Press in a stop in Alabama that the arrival of a second vessel in the coming days to help pump the oil from the deepwater gusher will allow engineers to make significant progress , even as others involved in the disaster were much less optimistic and continued to criticize BP over its litany of failures to control the spill . \nA team of researchers and government officials assembled by the Coast Guard and run by the director of the U.S. Geological Survey is studying the flow rate and hopes to present its latest findings in the coming days on what is already the biggest oil spill in U.S. history . \nIn an interview with The Associated Press , team member and Purdue University engineering professor Steve Wereley said it was a `` reasonable conclusion '' but not the team 's final one to say that the daily flow rate is , in fact , somewhere between 798,000 gallons -LRB- 3 million liters -RRB- and 1.8 million gallons -LRB- 6.8 million liters -RRB- . \n`` BP is claiming they 're capturing the majority of the flow , which I think is going to be proven wrong in short order , '' Wereley said . \n`` Why do n't they show the American public the before-and-after shots ? '' \nHe added : `` It 's strictly an estimation , and they are portraying it as fact . '' \nTo install the device snugly , BP engineers had to cut away the twisted and broken well pipe . \nThat increased the flow of oil , similar to what happens when a kink is removed from a garden hose . \nBP and others warned that would happen . \nThe government said the increase amounted to about 20 percent . \nAsked about the containment effort and the uncertainties in estimating how much oil is escaping , Allen said : `` I have never said this is going well . \nWe 're throwing everything we 've got . '' \nPaul Bommer , a University of Texas petroleum and geosystems engineering professor and member of the flow rate team , said cap seems to have made a `` dent '' in reducing the flow , but there is still a lot of oil coming out . \nThat seemed clear from the underwater `` spillcam '' video , which continued to show a big plume of gas and oil billowing into the water . \nThe current equipment collecting the oil being brought to the surface is believed to be nearing its daily processing capacity . \nBP said it will boost capacity by bringing in a floating platform it believes can process most of the flow , and believes the extra pumping power can help reduce the spill by early next week , when President Barack Obama is scheduled to make his fourth visit to the Gulf since the disaster began . \nThe company also said it will use a device that vaporizes and burns off oil while working to design a new cap that can capture more crude . \nAt the same time , BP is working to design a new cap that can capture more oil . \nIn the seven weeks since the oil rig explosion that set off the catastrophe , BP has had to improvise at every turn . \nThe most recent government estimates put the total amount of oil lost at 23.7 million to 51.5 million gallons . \n`` I think virtually everybody from BP to the state to the Coast Guard was caught flat-footed and did not expect a spill of this magnitude , '' said Ed Overton , a professor of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University . \n`` Everybody has been playing catch-up . '' \nWhen asked why BP did not have containment systems on standby in case of a leak , BP spokesman Robert Wine said there was no reason to think an accident on this scale was likely . \n`` It 's unprecedented , '' he said . \n`` That 's why these caps were n't there before . '' \nKenneth Arnold , an offshore drilling consultant and engineer , said the reason a bigger cap was n't installed first was that BP probably wanted to start with what it could do quickly , which he said makes sense . \nHe said BP has been working several solutions all along in parallel and deploying them as they can . \n`` They have n't been waiting for one to fail and then employing the next one , '' Arnold said . \nHe added : `` The idea you can wave your arm at this and come to a magical solution is just from someone who does n't understand the problem . \nWe as a nation are used to instant gratification . \nThere is a problem . \nWe want someone to fix it tomorrow . \nThings are not always that easy . '' \nSome answers may emerge next week , when BP CEO Tony Hayward will make his first appearance before Congress to answer questions in what will probably be a heated session , given the anger directed at BP . \nThe debate over the flow rate came as workers in bulldozers piled sand 6 feet -LRB- 1.83 meters -RRB- high along barrier islands bordering Louisiana to protect the environmentally fragile areas from the spill , which has already coated islands and pelican rookeries in thick , brown , sticky crude . \n`` This is finally something that can help , '' fishing guide Dave Marino said of the sand barrier effort . \n`` It looks like this is something that may work . '' \nAttempts to skim the oil progressed as well . \nBoats fanned out across the Gulf , dragging boom in their wake in an attempt to corral the oil . \nBut it 's an enormous task . \nIn some spots , the oil is several inches thick -LRB- centimeters -RRB- and forms a brown taffy-like goo that sticks to everything it touches . \nJohn Young , chairman of Louisiana 's Jefferson Parish Council , said additional equipment has been ordered and more dredgers will be moving into the area soon , along with barges that will help block the passes . \n`` It 's nice that BP has put up the money , but they need to ramp up not only the manpower but the equipment out there because we 're losing the battle , '' Young said . \n`` Unfortunately , we 're on day 50 and it 's too little too late , but I guess it 's better late than never . '' \nMeanwhile , researchers are beginning to obtain a clearer picture of the spill as they analyze water samples . \nFor example , marine scientists found a 100-foot -LRB- 30-meter -RRB- - thick layer of oil 1,300 feet -LRB- 390 meters -RRB- below the surface about 45 miles -LRB- 72 kilometers -RRB- from the well site . \nAnd officials in the Florida Panhandle are posting signs warning beachgoers not to swim or fish off a six-mile -LRB- 10-kilometer -RRB- stretch of oil-fouled beaches near the Alabama state line -- the first time such restrictions have been imposed in the state since the spill began .

'' \nFerguson said of Rio Ferdinand , who has been one of the several key figures who have helped to keep top scorer Dimitar Berbatov on the bench . \nFerdinand , who started limping early in Tuesday 's 2-1 win at old trafford but battled on , was just one of several key figures who were outstanding in a team whose cohesion is growing . \nMexico striker Javier Hernandez , goal-poacher in chief , has been a revelation and his knack of netting at key moments has kept top scorer Dimitar Berbatov on the bench . \nWayne Rooney has gelled better with Hernandez than Berbatov and seems to be revelling in a deeper position behind the Mexican that is proving very effective . \n`` He -LRB- Rooney -RRB- is enjoying the position he 's playing in at the moment because it has given him a lot of freedom to use his energy , in that position you do need energy , '' Ferguson told a news conference after Tuesday 's victory . \nIn the first leg Rooney was given too much space and scored the only goal of the game , and while Chelsea changed their shape to try to restrict him in the return leg he still pulled the strings and used his eye for a long ball to devastating effect . \nSimilarly effective has been the evergreen Ryan Giggs , who was involved in all three of his team 's goals in the tie , a feat made all the more remarkable by the fact he is now 37 . \nGiggs knows what it feels like to win the treble and that could be key as United seek success in the Champions League , Premier League and FA Cup . \n`` His experience and composure are vital , '' Ferguson said of the Welshman . \n`` He 's just a unique person and player . \n`` He 's lucky , in the sense he 's got a physique that does n't carry any weight , he 's got fantastic balance ... He looks after himself . \nTo play at 37 years of age there must be tremendous sacrifice to do that . '' \nFerguson was heading to Germany on Wednesday to find out who his team will face in the Champions League last four , although it is likely to be Schalke 04 who lead holders Inter Milan 5-2 from the first leg at the San Siro . \nIf United win the semi-final , a trip to Wembley for the final would beckon and they will have an early chance to get a feel for the turf this Saturday when they face lcoal rivals Manchester City in their FA Cup semi-final . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/syriancrisis_reuters/rsd/SyrianCrisis_reuters__2011-04-13__175.rsd.txt.ll_filled"}
{"txt": "An image from a video of a jagged pipe leaking millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , recorded by a BP camera a mile below the water 's surface . \nBP ROBERT , Louisiana -- BP was confident Saturday its latest experiment using a mile-long pipe would capture much of the oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico , even as the company disclosed yet another setback in the environmental disaster . \nEngineers hit a snag when they tried to connect two pieces of equipment a mile below the water 's surface . \nBP PLC chief operating officer Doug Suttles said one piece of equipment , called the framework , had to be brought to the water 's surface so that adjustments could be made to where it fits with the long tube that connects to a tanker above . \nThe framework holds a pipe and stopper , and engineers piloting submarine robots will try to use it to plug the massive leak and send the crude through the lengthy pipe to the surface . \n`` The frame shifted , so they were unable to make that connection , '' said Suttles , who believes the adjustments will make the device work . \nAt least 210,000 gallons of oil has been gushing into the Gulf of Mexico since an oil rig exploded April 20 and sank two days later . \nEleven people were killed in the blast . \nBP 's latest idea seems to have the best chance for success so far , said Ed Overton , a LSU professor of environmental studies . \nAt the surface this would be easy , Overton said , but using robots in 5,000 feet of water with oil gushing out of the pipe makes things much more difficult . \n`` It 's something like threading the eye of a needle . \nBut that can be tough to do up here . \nAnd you can imagine how hard it would be to do it down there with a robot , '' Overton said . \nThe tube could capture more than three-quarters of the leak ; BP also must contend with a smaller leak that 's farther away . \nIf the tube works , it would be the first time the company has been able to capture any of the oil before it fouls the Gulf waters . \nA week ago , the company tried to put a massive box over the leak , but icelike crystals formed and BP scrapped that plan . \nBP is also drilling a relief well that is considered the permanent solution to stopping the leak . \nIt 's about halfway done and still months away from being completed . \nThe company also is still considering using a smaller containment dome known as a `` top hat , '' as well as a `` junk shot , '' in which golf balls and rubber would be inserted to try to clog the leak . \nMeanwhile , BP began spraying undersea dispersants at that leak site and said the chemicals appear to have reduced the amount of surface oil . \nThis unprecedented use of chemical dispersants underwater , and the depth of the leak has created many unknowns regarding environmental impact , and researchers hurriedly worked to chart its effects . \nResearchers from the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology reported this week that they had detected large oil plumes from just beneath the surface of the sea to more than 4,000 feet deep . \nResearchers Vernon Asper and Arne Dierks said in Web posts that the plumes were `` perhaps due to the deep injection of dispersants which BP has stated that they are conducting . '' \nThree or four large plumes have been found , at least one that is 10 miles long and a mile wide , said Samantha Joye , a marine science professor supporting the mission from her University of Georgia lab . \nThese researchers were also testing the effects of large amounts of subsea oil on oxygen levels in the water . \nThe oil can deplete oxygen in the water , harming plankton and other tiny creatures that serve as food for a wide variety of sea critters . \nOxygen levels in some areas have dropped 30 percent , and should continue to drop , Joye said . \n`` It could take years , possibly decades , for the system to recover from an infusion of this quantity of oil and gas , '' Joye said . \n`` We 've never seen anything like this before . \nIt 's impossible to fathom the impact . '' \nJoye 's lab was waiting for the research boat to return so a team of scientists can test about 75 water samples and 100 sediment samples gathered during the voyage . \nResearchers plan to go back out in about a month and sample the same areas to see if oil and oxygen levels have worsened . \nFederal regulators on Friday approved the underwater use of the chemicals , which act like a detergent to break the oil into small globules and allow it to disperse more quickly into the water or air before it comes ashore . \nThe decision by the Environmental Protection Agency angered state officials and fishermen , who complained that regulators ignored their concerns about the effects on the environment and fish . \n`` The EPA is conducting a giant experiment with our most productive fisheries by approving the use of these powerful chemicals on a massive , unprecedented scale , '' John Williams , executive director of the Southern Shrimp Alliance , said in a news release . \nLouisiana Health and Hospitals Secretary Alan Levine sent a letter to BP outlining similar concerns , but the company and the Coast Guard said several tests were done before approval was given . \n`` We did n't cross this threshold lightly , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . \n`` This is a tool that will be analyzed and monitored . '' \nAs crews worked to limit the environmental hazards , Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano pressured BP to make clear whether the company would limit how much it will pay for clean up and compensation to those hurt by the spill . \nIn a letter to chief executive Tony Hayward , she noted that he and other executives have said they are taking full responsibility for cleaning up the spill and will pay what they call `` legitimate '' claims . \nNapolitano said the government believes this means BP will not limit its payments to a $ 75 million cap set by law for liability in some cases . \n`` The public has a right to a clear understanding of BP 's commitment to redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill , '' Napolitano wrote . \nOn Friday , President Barack Obama assailed oil drillers and his own administration as he ordered extra scrutiny of drilling permits . \nHe condemned the shifting of blame by oil executives and denounced a `` cozy relationship '' between the companies and the federal government .

{"txt": "Wednesday 6 April 2005 12.47 BST It looks like a Naomi Klein book . \nIt has her name emblazoned on the cover . \nIn a tilt to her bestseller , No Logo , it 's called No War . \nThe design is strikingly similar . \nThe book 's synopsis on Amazon namechecks the activist writer in the first sentence . \nBut , according to Klein , No War by Naomi Klein is not by her at all . \nIt is an anthology of essays which , says Klein , `` contains one previously published magazine article by me that has been available free-of-charge on my website for eight months '' . \nKlein is adamant that `` No War is not my book ; I had no role in choosing the title , and will accept no revenue from its sales . \n`` I am very concerned that readers will mistakenly believe that they are purchasing original writing , despite my best efforts to convince the publisher to clearly label the book what it is : an anthology of previously published articles by multiple authors , '' she adds . \nSo what 's going on ? \nThe # 4.99 paperback is published by Gibson Square books , a publishing company founded in 2001 by Martin Rynja , the former commissioning editor of Duckworth 's . \nAccording to its website , Gibson Square `` specialises in books with either a strong biographical element , or those which are based in some relevant way on personal experience . \nThey will , in addition , have a high publicity potential and be able to provoke or contribute to a current debate '' . \nGibson Square Books is certainly no stranger to controversy . \nLast July the independent publisher picked up Craig Unger 's House of Bush , House of Saud after Random House pulled out of a deal amid fears it could be sued for libel . \nThe book inspired some of the more sensational allegations contained in Michael Moore 's film Farenheit 9\\/11 and Amazon . \nco. uk refused to stock the book although all the major bookchains and Amazon 's US site carried it . \nAccording to Martin Rynja , the confusion over No War has arisen because of a last minute change of format of the book . \nGibson Square had originally intended to publish Klein 's article on its own . \nRynja says that he read the piece and thought it was `` mind-blowing - it 's long but it 's punchy and casts a light on the Iraq war which I found completely compelling . \nIt has the ` a-ha ! ' \nelement - after you have read it , something you have always vaguely thought becomes crystal clear '' . \nHe sought rights from Klein via her website and was sent a standard response email about the essay which said that the rights were controlled by Harper 's , the original publishers of the article . \nThe magazine agreed to sub-licence the article . \nRynja says that all was running smoothly until about three weeks before the publication date when he had two long conversations with Klein about the book . \n`` I heard that she is working on a new book on the subject and did n't want the essay published on its own , '' he says . \n`` She felt passionately that the book should be turned into an anthology with more authors included . \nWe could have gone ahead and published the essay on its own , as planned , if we had wanted as we had the rights , but because she felt very strongly and I admire her as a great thinker and writer - in the calibre of Noam Chomsky or Hannah Arendt - I did what I could and we missed the original publication date in order to include three other extremely strong authors who develop the seam of the lead article further . '' \nThe three other contributors are Susan Watkins , writing on the Iraq war as a front for US commercial , interests , Brian Miller on selling Iraq and Walter Lecoeur on terrorism . \nAccording to Rynja , the reason the other contributors are not mentioned on any of the online information about the book is because the revised data submitted to Neilson Bookdata and Amazon has not yet been updated and the sites are still displaying information referring to the original version of the Klein-only book . \nIn response to Klein 's claim that the writing in the book is not `` original '' , Ryjna argues that many books are published first in the US and then in the UK , or carried from one medium to another and that the work itself stays original . \n`` There is a market for books in their physical form rather than in electronic form , '' he says , `` it 's simply bringing her very important message to different markets . '' \nHowever , the situation may be murkier than it first appears . \nWhile it is true that Harper 's had syndication rights on Klein 's essay , the author retained the book contract rights and the sale of them to Ryjna by Harper 's was a mistake - one about which Klein says she knew nothing until three weeks before the book was due to be published . \nAt this point , having failed to persuade Ryjna to withdraw the book , Klein and her agent tried to salvage the situation as best they could , and avoid a protracted legal battle , by mooting the possibility of an anthology in which all the contributors would be equally credited . \nAgain , however , Gibson Square have a different take on events : they reiterate that they did approach Klein , via her website , to ask for the rights to publish the essay in book form in the UK and were told to approach the magazine , from whom the rights were obtained . \nThey then claim they went back to Klein in the first week of March to ask for corrections or additions , at which point the idea to include three other writers came up , and was agreed to . \nPolitico 's , the specialist political online bookstore , is advertising No War as being `` by Naomi Klein '' on its website , and reports no complaints about it from customers but they have not yet sold a single copy of the book . \n`` I was not aware of Naomi Klein 's statement but I will look into it , '' said a spokesman for Politicos , `` If the book is being mis-sold we will take it off the site . '' \nWaterstone 's Economist 's Bookshop at the LSE said that they had sold three copies of the book , from a stock of about 25 , and had received no complaints from customers . \nThe book is officially published on April 18 and , says Rynja , Gibson Square 's wholesalers have already sold nearly a thousand copies of the book . \nMeanwhile , Naomi Klein is encouraging readers interested in her essay , Baghdad Year Zero , to download it for free from her website , nologo.org .

putting forward proposals to try to bring about an immediate ceasefire by both sides , access for humanitarian aid and the beginning of political dialogue . \nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon earlier warned of serious repercussions if the crisis in Syria is not resolved . \nSpeaking at a conference in Indonesia he warned the world could not afford to look away . \n`` We all have a responsibility to work for a resolution of this profound and extremely dangerous situation , a crisis that has potentially massive repercussions for the region and the world , '' he said . \nThe British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave details of army activity in the Khalidiya district of Homs and activists have also reported shelling in Rastan , north of Homs , and at Qalat Mudiq , northwest of Hama . \nSyria restricts access to foreign media which often makes it impossible to independently verify reports coming out of the country . \nThe UN says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the year-long uprising , while tens of thousands of people have fled their homes . \nOn Tuesday Russia warned Syria 's leadership it was making `` a lot of mistakes '' , signalling Moscow may be hardening its stance on Damascus . \nRussia is a key ally of Syria and , along with China , has twice thwarted attempts to agree to a UN resolution condemning Mr Assad 's actions . \nBut observers believe Moscow 's patience with Damascus has been wearing thin . \nMeanwhile the US campaign group Human Rights Watch -LRB- HRW -RRB- accused elements of Syria 's armed opposition of carrying out serious human rights abuses , including kidnapping , torture and execution . \nThe opposition Syrian National Council said in a statement that it `` deplores the reported incidents of human rights violations by armed opposition groups in Syria '' and it is working to ensure `` abuse does not happen in the fight for freedom '' . \nHRW has frequently accused Syria 's government of abuse over the past year of conflict . \nThe Syrian government has been trying to suppress an uprising inspired by events in Tunisia , Egypt and Libya . \nThe UN says thousands have been killed in the crackdown , and that many more have been detained and displaced . \nThe Syrian government says hundreds of security forces personnel have also died combating `` armed terrorist gangs '' . \nThe family of President Bashar al-Assad has been in power since his father , Hafez , took over in a coup in 1970 . \nThe country underwent some liberalisation after Bashar became president in 2000 , but the pace of change soon slowed , if not reversed . \nCritics are imprisoned , domestic media are tightly controlled , and economic policies often benefit the elite . \nThe country 's human rights record is among the worst in the world . \nSyria is a country of 21 million people with a Sunni Muslim majority -LRB- 74 % -RRB- and significant minorities of Alawites - the Shia heterodox sect to which Mr Assad belongs - and Christians . \nMr Assad promotes a secular identity for the country , but he has concentrated power in the hands of family and other Alawites . \nProtests have generally been biggest in Sunni-dominated areas . \nUnder the sanctions imposed by the Arab League , US and EU , Syria 's two most vital sectors , tourism and oil , have ground to a halt in recent months . \nThe IMF says Syria 's economy contracted by 2 % in 2011 , while the value of the Syrian pound has crashed . \nUnemployment is high , electricity cuts trouble Damascus , and critical products like heating oil and staples like milk powder are becoming scarce . \nPro-democracy protests erupted in March 2011 after the arrest and torture of a group of teenagers who had painted revolutionary slogans on walls at their school in the southern city of Deraa . \nSecurity forces opened fire during a march against the arrests , killing four . \nThe next day , the authorities shot at mourners at the victims ' funerals , killing another person . \nPeople began demanding the overthrow of Mr Assad . \nThe government has tried to deal with the situation with a combination of minor concessions and force . \nPresident Assad ended the 48-year-long state of emergency and introduced a new constitution offering multi-party elections . \nBut at the same time , the authorities have continued to use violence against unarmed protesters , and some cities , like Homs , have suffered weeks of intense bombardment . \nThe opposition is deeply divided . \nSeveral groups formed a coalition , the Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- , but it is dominated by the Sunni community and exiled dissidents . \nThe SNC disagrees with the National Co-ordination Committee -LRB- NCC -RRB- on the questions of talks with the government and foreign intervention , and has found it difficult to work with the Free Syrian Army - army defectors seeking to topple Mr Assad by force . \nInternational pressure on the Syrian government has been intensifying . \nIt has been suspended from the Arab League , while the EU and the US have imposed sanctions . \nHowever , there has been no agreement on a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to violence . \nAlthough military intervention has been ruled out by Western nations , there are increasing calls to arm the opposition . \nCorrespondents say a peaceful solution seems unlikely . \nSyria 's leadership seems intent on crushing resistance and most of the opposition will only accept an end to the regime . \nSome believe the expected collapse of Syria 's currency and an inability to pay salaries may be the leadership 's downfall . \nThere are fears , though , that the resulting chaos would be long-lasting and create a wider conflict . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/syriancrisis_bbc/rsd/SyrianCrisis_bbc__2012-03-21__136.rsd.txt"}

{"txt": "NEW ORLEANS | Mon Jul 12 , 2010 7:47 pm EDT NEW ORLEANS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Sal Sunseri 's P&J Oyster Company has worked Louisiana waters since 1876 , making it the oldest operating oyster processor in the United States . \nBut the future is grim , he told a presidential panel on Monday , due to the devastating BP Plc spill that has been gushing oil into the Gulf of Mexico since late April . \n`` Due to this unnatural catastrophe in our water , P&J may forever be extinct , '' he said . \nSunseri , who has already laid off 11 workers , was among a group of speakers from the fishing , seafood and tourism industries sharing stories of loss with the seven-member commission investigating the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \nKeith Overton , chairman of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association , said tourism operators across his state were already suffering even though tar balls had been found only on the Florida Panhandle in the north . \nAt his company , TradeWinds Island Resorts near St Petersburg , calls from potential customers are down 25 percent , he said . \n`` These losses have occurred in our area without a single drop of oil reaching our shore , '' said Overton . \nHe implored the panel not to overlook legitimate claims from businesses hit by a public misperception that all Gulf Coast areas should be avoided . \n`` I think our losses are going to be scrutinized . \nGive us the benefit of the doubt , '' Overton said . \nPresident Barack Obama set up the commission with an executive order in late May , a month after a rig drilling a well for BP , the Deepwater Horizon owned by Transocean Ltd , sank after an explosion . \nEleven workers were killed and the damaged well has been spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico from a mile under the surface . \nBP is using a containment system to capture some of the oil and hopes to finally plug the leak by mid-August . \nMichael Hecht of Greater New Orleans Inc , an economic development agency , warned the panel not to underestimate the damage of a moratorium on deepwater drilling sought by the Obama administration . \n`` The economic impact from the oil spill itself , however broad and long-lasting , will likely be dwarfed by the impact of the moratorium , '' Hecht said . \nA drilling freeze threatens 24,000 jobs in Louisiana alone , representing nearly $ 2 billion in wages , he said . \nCherri Foytlin , who spoke during a public comment period , said the $ 1,600 she and her husband , an out-of-work offshore oil worker , brought in last month to support their six children barely covered their $ 1000 mortgage . \n`` Whatever you do , please take into account that you are talking about people , '' Foytlin said . \n`` You are not talking about numbers , you are not talking about politics . \nYou are talking about my family . \nMy whole Louisiana family .

{"txt": "Claudia Bradshaw | 10:39 UK time , Friday , 6 August 2010 ` Despite headlines screaming `` the worst oil spill in history '' it turns out the BP blowout disaster was n't really as big a deal as you 'd have thought ' . \nSo says Addison Wiggin , as the US government admits that nearly 75 % of all the oil leaked into the Gulf has already been removed . \nThe average lake has higher concentrations of greasy suntan lotion from swimmers ... So everybody really ought to just calm down about it ... The Gulf shores will get cleaned up and big mother earth will do the rest . \nAnd John Polomny argues this is what rational people have been saying all along . \nWriting in New Orleans , John says : . \n`` The media over-hyped the oil spill , '' said Addison Wiggin . \nIt 's the Cry Wolf syndrome . \nIt also diverts attention from real issues , like the nutrients dumped into the Gulf from the Everglades . \nThe threat of oil pales compared to this . \nWriting in Florida , Mike says : Pensacola Beach is beautiful . \nBlue crabs are having sex in the Louisiana marsh . \nClosed sections of the Gulf are once again open to fishing . \nThe seafood is safe . \nAnd he argues the main damage to the coast has been from ` hysterical reports that scared away tourists and damaged the reputation of Gulf seafood ' . \nMost scientists agree ... that it 's far too early to write off the possibility of long-term consequences from releasing 210 million gallons of oil into the ocean . \nWhat 's more , it 's clear that even the good news ... only raises more questions about where the pollutants have gone . \nHe suggests there could be a link between the BP oil spill and the Gulf Dead Zone , a massive area of water in the Gulf of Mexico that 's so deprived of oxygen it 's uninhabitable to sea life much of the year . \nAnd nearly 40 % of people in this online survey think the devastation from the oil spill has ` absolutely not ' been over-hyped . \nIt 's certainly the biggest , but is the BP Gulf of Mexico the worst , or just the most ` over-hyped ' oil leak in history ? \nWHYS is a global conversation hosted by BBC News . \nFor updates on the stories and issues being covered on our broadcasts , pls visit our facebook page . \nThis is when we 're on air : 1100 & 1700GMT Monday to Friday BBC World Service radio 1500 & 1930GMT on Fridays BBC World News television For the latest updates across BBC blogs , 3 months , 1 week ago 3 months , 1 week ago You can stay up to date with World Service - World Have Your Say via these feeds . \nThese are some of the popular topics this blog covers .

{"txt": "Views Diverge on How To Recast Fannie , Freddie Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- \nsaid Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 's `` public-private entanglement '' will likely be undone . \nViews diverge on how to recast Fannie and Freddie . \nUnder one possible approach , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the federally run companies that control half of the nation 's $ 11 trillion mortgage market , would disappear , leaving lending primarily to private banks . \nTaxpayers would no longer be on the line for subsidizing home loans . \nBut analysts say it could become much harder to get a mortgage -- at least one with a relatively low interest rate and a 30-year term . \nUnder another approach , Fannie and Freddie would remain . \nThey could continue as private companies , trying to strike the difficult balance between the demands of profit-seeking shareholders and those of policy-oriented lawmakers . \nThey could also be turned into government agencies . \nIn either of these cases , taxpayers would remain potentially exposed to trillions of dollars in losses . \nThe debate comes after the nation endured a bruising effort to promote homeownership in the past decade . \nFannie and Freddie provided hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to people with blemished credit records or other financial limitations , which led to huge losses and the government seizing the firms in September as the financial crisis escalated . \nThe government agreed to cover as much as $ 200 billion in losses . \nNow policymakers are looking at ways to prevent a relapse while maintaining Fannie and Freddie 's charge of supplying consistent funding for mortgages . \nFannie , Freddie and government agencies are funding nearly all of the nation 's home loans ; private lenders have all but disappeared . \n`` If we want to divorce the federal government from the risks of the housing system , you would privatize it , '' said Howard Glaser , a housing consultant who has worked for Fannie and Freddie . \n`` The cost of that is you never know if you 'll have mortgage finance available . \nCase in point : today . '' \nFannie and Freddie were chartered by Congress 40 years ago as private companies with a government mandate to buy mortgages from lenders , package them , guarantee them against default and sell them to investors around the world . \nAs a result , borrowers in big cities or small towns could go to big banks or small thrifts and get a 30-year , fixed-rate loan at an affordable rate . \nBut risks always loomed . \nInvestors assumed that the government backed Fannie and Freddie , even if they did not have such support officially . \nAs a result , the companies could borrow cheaply and grow big -- with as much outstanding debt as the U.S. government . \nBut the housing crisis crippled the companies , prompting the Bush administration to take them over out of concern they 'd severely damage the world financial system . \nSome longtime supporters of Fannie and Freddie say they must change , but still see a need for the government to play a role . \n`` The Fannie and Freddie model has to be approached and the private-public entanglement , I think , will be undone , '' Rep. Barney Frank -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- \n, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said in a recent interview . \nFrank said the reform of Fannie and Freddie is likely to include `` some subsidy for enhanced affordability and increasing the flow of mortgages . '' \nBut there is little agreement about precisely how to restructure them . \nWhile Frank no longer thinks the hybrid model is viable , another influential lawmaker does . \n`` The hybrid is the best , '' said Sen. Charles E. Schumer -LRB- D-N.Y. -RRB- , who leads the Joint Economic Committee . \n`` The hybrid nature should remain . '' \nPresident-elect Barack Obama has said little on the topic . \nObama 's chief economic adviser , former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers , has long been a critic of the risks posed by Fannie and Freddie . \nIn a Washington Post opinion piece this past summer , Summers wrote that the government should use Fannie and Freddie to support the housing market during the crisis and that the government should then `` divide their functions into government and private components , the latter of which would be sold off in multiple pieces .

{"txt": "Oil spill will hurt U.S. economy , but not big enough to cause recession The ecological damage in the Gulf of Mexico is a national tragedy and has been economically devastating for some coastal communities . \nBut will all the spilled oil lead to significant economic losses on a national level ? \nWe do n't think so . \nAfter extensive research into the economic consequences of the spill , and crunching industry data as well as figures from several state and federal agencies , we estimate the disaster will lower U.S. economic growth in 2010 by roughly 0.1 percent -- and will dampen growth in the four states most affected -LRB- Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida -RRB- by 1.6 percent of their combined gross domestic product . \nIn dollar terms , we see the oil spill leading to a net loss of just under $ 20 billion for the U.S. economy in 2010 . \nThis is a big hit , to be sure , but it 's not a severe enough external shock to tip the United States into a double-dip recession . \nEven factoring out the losses to BP , which are large but wo n't weigh directly on U.S. gross domestic product , the oil industry seems likely to suffer the most from the spill . \nInterestingly , the two factors most commonly cited -- the oil lost into the ocean and President Obama 's now-sidelined moratorium on new deepwater drilling projects -- do n't account for the bulk of the damage . \nOur analysis shows increased expenses from regulation of deepwater drilling and insurance costing the industry roughly $ 6.5 billion ; it would mean $ 2.3 billion in collateral losses for oil and gas support industries . \nBy contrast , the costs of the moratorium should be less than $ 200 million in 2010 , even if it continues for six months as originally planned . \nAnd even using the most extreme estimates on the size of the spill , the cost of the crude lost in the ocean will be well under $ 1 billion , assuming oil prices stay near current levels . \nNor do we see the spill creating a supply shock that significantly affects the price of oil . \nThe U.S. oil market is well supplied , with inventories above their five-year averages , and consumption remains subdued . \nShipping lanes do not seem to have been affected much , and the United States could always tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a pinch . \nThe Gulf of Mexico produces only 1.7 percent of the world 's petroleum , and most of this production is continuing as scheduled . \nAfter the energy industry , we estimate the biggest losses will be suffered by tourism : $ 8.4 billion regionwide , with Louisiana and Florida taking the biggest losses . \nParticularly in Florida , many of these losses wo n't necessarily result from actual pollution but , rather , from fearful tourists canceling trips . \nThe insurance industry has dodged a bullet . \nBP is self-insured and thus will cover most cleanup costs . \nMany of the coastal wetlands degraded by the spill were not insured for environmental damage . \nStill , using data from Moody 's , we estimate that the insurance industry will lose $ 2.5 billion , given payouts to affected companies and private property owners . \nAlthough fishing has received a great deal of media coverage , and losses will be painful for some local economies , we project the industry 's losses at $ 1.2 billion , well below those of oil and tourism . \nThe long-term impact of the spill could be more profound for the environment , specific industries and the overall economy . \nIt 's possible the spill could hasten a shift toward energy companies forgoing insurance -- and planning to eat the costs in the event of spills . \nThis could spell losses for the insurance industry and could create risks that a company wo n't be able to cover its losses and will file for bankruptcy in the wake of a future spill . \nAnother possibility is that the spill will change the calculus of countries considering offshore oil drilling projects , thereby suppressing global output in the long run . \nThe chances of this are low , however , given the economic imperatives facing many of these countries ' governments , particularly in emerging markets . \nFinally , the Obama administration seems inclined to use the spill to rally support for a `` clean energy '' bill , which has been stalled in the Senate . \nYet even if this effort succeeds , the legislation most likely to be pushed through does n't have much in the way of teeth , meaning it wo n't radically alter U.S. oil consumption and thus wo n't represent a direct swipe at U.S. oil and gas interests . \nThe situation in the gulf is urgent . \nBP and policymakers should do everything in their power to speed the recovery effort . \nBut economic prognosticators can take heart . \nThis sunken oil rig is n't likely to sink the U.S. economy . \nLee Hudson Teslik is senior editor and commodities analyst at Roubini Global Economics . \nChristian Menegatti is head of global research at Roubini Global Economics . \nThey are co-authors of a new paper , `` Deepwater Does n't Mean a Double Dip .

'' \nBut in the face of emerging criticism , Obama and other top officials said the federal government has brought all possible resources to bear , rejecting comparisons to the Bush administration 's handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . \nThey said British Petroleum is ultimately responsible , but that the federal government will do its part to contain the damage and stop the leak . \nThe president cautioned Sunday that the effort could take `` many days , '' and said the federal government would spare no resource in attacking the problem , though BP will foot the bill in the end . \n`` From day one , we have prepared and planned for the worst , '' Obama said . \n`` Your government will do whatever it takes , for as long as it takes , to stop this crisis .

'' \nShe said BP is `` ultimately responsible '' for the disaster , an assessment echoed by Adm. Thad Allen , commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard . \nAllen said the federal government should not completely take over the cleanup because , `` by statute and by law , BP is the responsible party . '' \nHe said the firm bears responsibility and costs in the aftermath of the spill . \nHe said , though , that the cleanup effort will continue to be a collaboration . \n`` It 's a combination of BP and the federal government , '' he said . \n`` We both have to execute our responsibilities . '' \nThe spill has already impacted the Gulf Coast economy . \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Sunday announced that it was closing commercial and recreational fishing along the coastline from Louisiana to the Florida panhandle . \nTim Kant , mayor of Fairhope , Ala. , told Fox News that the federal government needs to step up its response , even if it means sending BP the bill later . \n`` This is too much for BP or any company to deal with , '' he said . \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar told `` Fox News Sunday '' that the federal government is doing all it can to help keep the spill from spreading . \n`` Every effort is being made to stop the source right now , '' he said . \n`` There has not been a minute of rest since this started .

{"txt": "cents Hayward tells investors he wo n't resign from BP cents New blow to hopes of halting BP oil spill A Kemp 's Ridley turtle being cleaned after rescue from the BP oil spill . \nPhotograph : Bevil Knapp\\/EPA BP 's embattled boss Tony Hayward is touring City investors in an attempt to restore his tattered reputation and secure his future at the oil company . \nA series of crucial meetings with shareholders have been arranged for Hayward and BP 's chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg to explain how BP can cope with the multi-billion pound financial damage being wreaked on the business by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nHayward is said to have been in constant contact with the company \u2019 s chief executive Tony Hayward and Mr Svanberg to explain how it can cope with the globalized financial crisis . \nOne big investor said Hayward appears to have bounced back from his lacklustre appearance in front of a Congressional committee this month : `` He was very impressive . \nHe has two years to sort out the escrow -LRB- compensation -RRB- fund and the sale of assets . \nThere is no huge urgency . \nHe is planning for the future and we will support him . '' \nAnother major investor said Hayward would be facing questions about the future shape and size of BP whether it might be best in the long term for the company to be broken up or restructured in a way that means local disasters can be ring-fenced from the rest of the group : `` I certainly think that the company needs to have a structure with more effective ` fire breaks ' . '' \nHe added that investors are not pressing for Hayward to be replaced : `` Witch hunting and deciding who to sack should be a very low priority . '' \nHayward 's tour of the City did not stop BP 's shares slumping to their lowest level in 14 years . \nThey closed down more than 6 % at 298p and are now less than half their 658p level before the Deepwater Horizon explosion . \nThe disaster has now wiped more than $ 100bn -LRB- # 67bn -RRB- off BP 's stock market value . \nInvestors were reacting to a BP statement that the costs of cleaning up the spill had now reached $ 2.35 bn -LRB- # 1.6 bn -RRB- though that will be a tiny part of the final bill . \nThere were also mounting fears that the hurricane season could hamper clean-up operations . \nThe US national hurricane center said today there was a 70 % chance that a low pressure area in the Caribbean could develop into a tropical storm in the Gulf and the US coast guard said it would begin shutting down BP 's containment operations five days before gale force winds were due to arrive . \nThe company is currently struggling to put back a containment cap on the well which had earlier reduced spill volumes but later was knocked out of place . \nBP expects to have the new cap in place within a week . \nHayward 's City meetings came a day after he held a series of `` town hall '' meetings at BP 's UK offices to tell employees the company was recovering though still in `` intensive care '' . \nThe group has already set aside a $ 20bn compensation fund for those such as local shrimp fishermen in Louisiana who have lost their livelihoods . \nBP is said to be looking at a possible $ 10bn bond offering in an attempt to strengthen its balance sheet to pay the rising cost of spill liabilities and claims . \nBut David Cameron for the first time raised the spectre of BP becoming bankrupt , saying he feared the destruction of the company . \nSpeaking in advance of a meeting with Barack Obama , he said : `` I think it is in all our long-term interest that there is some clarity , some finality to all of this so that we do n't at the same time see the destruction of a company that is important for all our interests . '' \nBP is also understood to be in talks with banks to raise a further $ 20bn through loans , with another $ 20bn from asset sales in the coming two years . \nIt has already scrapped shareholder dividends until the end of the year ahead of a dressing down by a frustrated Obama at the White House last week . \nThe company has seen a huge surge in attention from short sellers who borrow stock and sell it on , expecting they will be able to buy it back later at a lower price . \nWith debt expensive and asset sales taking time , broker Nomura said an equity-based fundraising backed by sovereign wealth funds may be a more attractive short-term solution . \nThe oil group also confirmed its two relief wells intended to stop the leaking well completely are set to be completed within three months of the date work began , following concerns by some industry experts that they could take much longer . \nHowever , the hurricane season , which runs until the end of November , could yet intervene . \nThe group has so far captured 364,500 barrels of oil through its containment system , but it is estimated that 35,000-60 ,000 barrels a day are continuing to pour from the well , which ruptured after the rig exploded on 20 April , killing 11 workers . \nHayward officially handed over day-to-day control of the Gulf of Mexico crisis to BP board director Bob Dudley this week as it set up a new division to manage the spill . \nEmployees are said to have been told that operating results due out next month will be `` very strong '' . \nA version appeared on p36 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 00.54 BST on Saturday 26 June 2010 Our selection of best buys The latest news and comment from our team of reporters , writers and editors in the US Auto update every minute On | Off kennelliott : mt @ripetungi : Amazing project to map the surface of Mars . \nAnyone can help and contribute to project .

'' \nSome Republican opponents questioned the logic of the president making a televised prime-time speech to the country before meeting with top BP executives on Wednesday . \n`` That 's a little surprising to me , '' Republican Governor Haley Barbour of Mississippi told CBS 's `` Face the Nation '' program about the timing of Obama 's speech . \n`` If I were , as governor , trying to make sure somebody does something , I would meet with them before I went on television . '' \nThe Obama administration has delayed plans to permit new offshore drilling as a result of the spill . \nThe crisis has put Obama on the defensive and distracted his team from the domestic agenda -- a new energy policy , reform of Wall Street and bolstering a struggling American economy . \nMark Tayamen , a Louisiana shrimper idled by the spill , said there is little Obama can say to make him feel better . \n`` This is our livelihood . \nIt 's where we have fun and teach our kids and grandchildren . \nThere ai n't nothing out there now , '' he said in Venice , preparing to take his boat out to rescue oiled birds and animals , thanks to a contract from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . \n`` There ai n't nothing -LRB- Obama -RRB- can say . \nThe damage is done . '' \nPeople in southern Louisiana are frustrated with BP for the spill but also at Obama 's drilling moratorium because many families have members who work in the oil industry . \nThe focus on America 's biggest environmental disaster comes ahead of November 's congressional elections in which the Democrats are expected to struggle to keep their majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate . \nU.S. public anger is high as the crisis nears two months and news is marked by images of polluted beaches , oil-covered birds and fishermen anxious about their precarious situation . \nDemocrats want Obama to tap that mood to press for development of alternative energies such as solar and wind power . \nThe United States and Britain played down diplomatic tensions over the crisis . \nBritish Foreign Secretary William Hague said it was up to the British energy giant , under pressure in the United States to suspend its stock dividend to help pay for the damage , to make that decision alone . \nA source told Reuters on Sunday the company was unlikely to cancel the dividend , currently valued at about $ 10.5 billion annually . \nThe source told Reuters on Sunday that options being considered were deferring the dividend , paying it in shares or paying into a ring-fenced account until liabilities are known and that the issue probably would not be decided this week . \nBP placed a containment cap on its blown out seabed well this month after a series of failures to stem the flow but oil continues to gush from it , polluting beaches and wildlife habitats , killing marine life and damaging tourism and fishing . \nThe partly contained leak is estimated to flow at up to 40,000 barrels -LRB- 1.68 million gallons\\/6 .36 million liters -RRB- a day . \nU.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral James Watson told BP in a June 11 letter made public Saturday that its containment plan did not go far enough or include enough back-up measures in the event of equipment failure or other problems . \nHe gave the company two days to come up with a fix . \nThad Allen , the U.S. Coast Guard admiral heading the federal relief effort , told CBS he expects BP to present a plan to increase oil capture later on Sunday . \nU.S. lawmakers have called on Obama to take a harder line with BP , which has lost tens of billions of dollars in market value so far . \nBut senior British officials have warned about the economic impact of destabilizing a company that is a staple holding of British pension funds . \nIn a phone call on Saturday , Obama told British Prime Minister David Cameron he had no interest in undermining the value of BP and the two leaders played down tensions over the oil spill and reaffirmed close ties . \nCameron , who took office last month , is under pressure in Britain to do more to protect a company that accounts for 12 percent of all dividends paid by British companies . \nOn Tuesday , lawmakers hold a hearing in Washington with all the big oil companies including the head of BP 's U.S. operation . \nOn Thursday BP 's Hayward , who is expected to attend Wednesday 's White House meeting , will testify to the U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee . \nBP expects its cost for the Gulf oil clean-up to be $ 3 billion to $ 6 billion . \nMany analysts expect a higher cost . \nStates along the Gulf coast are increasingly demanding financial compensation from BP as the spill spreads along their shorelines , slamming tourism and fishing industries . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nApparently they own the politicians . \nIt 's up to us to dissuade these companies from gambling with the our quality of lives for a little extra profit . \nBP controls the crime scene , BP is now telling us how much the clean up will cost ? \nIf BP knows so much maybe they can bring the eleven men and 10,000 creatures back to life . \nOr maybe they should stop the leak . \nOr maybe they should be shown what 's what . \nAs usual , Obama has covered all the bases and done nothing . \nThis surely must be Bush 's fault Blaming Obama for this is precisely as reasonable as blaming the post war government in Germany after World War II for the destruction and economic crisis . \nThis is the result of conservative policies championed by Republicans . \nNo I have a better analogy , its like blaming the police after a rape ! \nWe could have weaned ourselves from oil decades ago but you Conservative Republicans have fought and cut the budget for alternatives every step of the way . \nNot only that its the Republicans who led the deregulation charge -- well here 's your result , a dead gulf of Mexico . \nThe fact that someone could even make an argument to the contrary shows either a total lack of objective reasoning or a cynical attempt to confuse the ignorant . \nHave you no shame ! \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-06-13__163.rsd.txt.ll_filled"}

'' \nOne problem is that Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists are in Bani Walid and Sirte , which are densely populated . \nThat makes it risky to try to bomb them because of the danger of civilian casualties . \nNATO , argues Shashank Joshi , an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute in London , lacks sufficient intelligence to allow it to pinpoint targets in Sirte and Bani Walid without endangering civilians . \n`` We are in a fortress situation where the city is under siege . \nIf you do n't know that a particular building is being used as a school or a mosque , even the best intelligence wo n't give you the details , '' he said . \n`` In Tripoli , you had rebels , you had -LRB- Western -RRB- special forces , networks of resistance . \nWe do n't have that kind of information in Sirte or Bani Walid . \nSo targeting is inherently difficult . '' \nTo a degree , battle conditions with Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists necessitate a change of operational approach because of the limitations of NATO jets ' firepower which is to dangerous to use , said Ripley of Jane 's Defense Weekly . \n`` Gaddafi forces are no longer using tanks and artillery that were easier to hit and identify . \nThe NTC is using infantry to drive Gaddafi 's forces from building to building , '' Ripley said . \n`` Both sides are operating in such close proximity that differentiating between the sides is difficult . \nThat makes it very difficult to use air-drop weapons -LRB- bombs -RRB- . '' \nExperts say other constraints also complicate NATO 's operations in Sirte and Bani Walid as its military commanders plan how to fulfill the alliance 's United Nations mandate in Libya to protect civilians during the civil war . \nSo far , NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said , there are no confirmed cases of civilians being killed by NATO power , although alliance officials say some can not be ruled out . \nHuman rights organizations have called on the alliance to lean on NTC fighters to do more to protect civilians as worries mount for people trapped in Sirte . \nDesperation is growing in the besieged city as civilians try to flee the battle , both sides are accusing each other of endangering civilians , and aid agencies say a humanitarian disaster is looming because of shrinking supplies of water , electricity and food . \n`` NATO has significant influence over the actions of -LRB- NTC -RRB- forces , '' said Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch . \n`` And needs to use it to ensure that the NTC meet their legal obligation under international law -LRB- to avoid civilian casualties -RRB- , '' he said . \nAnother challenge for NATO , Bouckaert added , was preventing NTC forces from taking action against civilians they suspect of siding with Gaddafi loyalists . \n`` It is essential that those civilian populations , even if they are pro-Gaddafi , do not suffer from vengeance , '' he said . \nNATO officials acknowledge difficulties they are facing in Gaddafi 's last strongholds but have given little indication of how much firepower the deposed leader has at his disposal , other than `` small logistical and mobility capabilities '' . \n`` Their actions are limited to tactical initiatives in isolated pockets , representing a fraction of Libya 's territory and population , '' said NATO spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie . \n`` They do n't control many access routes within Libya . \nThe mission is not yet over but the end is near , '' Focusing on Gaddafi loyalists ' access routes to supplies or way out of their strongholds might be an important part of NATO tactics in the near future , military experts said . \n`` A very big role NATO can play is to dominate the terrain , the roads outside of town , '' said Ripley . \n`` They can enforce the siege but they can not finish off Gaddafi forces . \nThey can prevent them from rebuilding , replenishing or escaping . '' \nAlready , NATO figures from recent days show the alliance 's targeting has focused on storage and command facilities and less on tanks and artillery assets . \nOutside of Sirte and Bani Walid , NATO forces will likely concentrate on hunting down any weaponry left behind by the Gaddafi regime , experts said . \n`` There is a lot of kit left in the country , '' said Douglas Barrie , a military aviation specialist at London 's International Institute of Strategic Studies . \n`` The bombing campaign did n't destroy all of the regime 's military capacity by any stretch of imagination . \nWe did n't have enough aircraft , we did n't have enough time . \n`` I suppose the -LRB- NATO -RRB- thinking is they do n't want to leave any credible rump of military capabilities that could cause problems for the transitional council .

Gen. Charles Bouchard of Canada , who commands the Libya operation . \nJournalists later visited a hospital where they reported they saw the bodies of three men , at least two covered in dust , and a number of injured people . \nCNN did not go on the hospital visit because of safety concerns . \nOn Monday , forces loyal to Gadhafi attacked a rebel-held border crossing into Tunisia in a battle that resulted in nine deaths , according to the rebels ' military commander in Zintan , Hajj Osama . \nHe said Gadhafi infantry who attacked rebels controlling the border post suffered eight fatalities ; one rebel fighter was killed . \nFood and fuel are shipped into Libya and wounded rebels are taken out for medical treatment via the crossing , which is literally a lifeline to the rebels , the rebel commander said . \nSince they were driven from the border checkposts by rebels more than two weeks ago , Gadhafi 's troops have been shelling the rebels ' nearby mountaintop holdouts to try to regain control of this vital artery . \nIn the towns of Yefren and Algalaa , southwest of Tripoli , only about 1,000 residents remained of the usual population of 22,000 , said a local person who is in touch with rebels there . \nThe military commander in Zintan , near the border with Tunisia , corroborated those numbers . \nThey contrast with figures issued by the Libyan Committee for Humanitarian aid and Relief , which said 22,000 to 25,000 people remained trapped in the two towns , and that about 40,000 others had been displaced to other towns in the Nafusa Mountains , Tripoli and Tunisia . \nFor the past two months , the towns ' dwindling numbers of residents have been enduring spartan living conditions -- without electricity or fuel and with only limited access to water , since Gadhafi forces control the region 's water wells and have contaminated some of them with oil , the committee said . \nBanks in Yefren and Algalaa have been closed since February 17 , which has led to a widespread shortage of cash , it added . \nThe cities ' main water tank has been out of commission since it was damaged six weeks ago by missiles and no food supplies have entered the area since March 1 , it said . \nSnipers loyal to Gadhafi control access to the hospital in Yefren and most doctors have fled , it added . \nIn other NATO efforts against Gadhafi forces Monday , an airstrike hit a Libyan army position outside the rebel town of Jadu in the western mountains , rebels in Zintan told CNN . \nThe attack took place around noon -LRB- 6 a.m. ET -RRB- , shortly after the Gadhafi forces at that position had launched Grad rockets into the rebel-held town , rebels said . \nNATO reported Monday that since its operation began on March 31 , it has flown 7,870 sorties , including 3,025 strike sorties , which are intended to identify and engage targets , but do not necessarily deploy munitions . \nOn Sunday , a command-and-control center was hit near Tripoli and a missile support facility was struck near Al Khums , NATO said in a news release . \nNear Sirte , an ammunition storage facility was struck and , near Brega , a command-and-control facility was targeted , it said . \nA spokesman for France 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said France plans to add attack helicopters to the country 's arsenal in Libya , saying the aircraft would make `` more precise '' strikes possible . \nMedia reports said Britain also plans to use attack helicopters . \nA spokesman for Britain 's Ministry of Defense said only that , `` As with any military campaign , we are constantly reviewing our options alongside allies to enhance the capabilities available to NATO . '' \nNearly 600 migrants and wounded civilians arrived Monday afternoon in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi aboard a boat from the embattled city of Misrata , said the International Organization for Migration , which chartered the vessel . \nThe boat 's arrival marked the seventh such mission carried out by the group since mid-April . \nThe boat 's passengers included nearly 400 people from Niger as well as migrants from Nigeria , Chad , Sudan , Pakistan , Egypt , Bangladesh , Tunisia and seven Palestinians . \nThe boat had arrived Saturday in Misrata carrying 280 tons of food aid and a field hospital . \nThe developments came as the International Committee of the Red Cross appealed to donors for an additional $ 53 million `` to help the organization meet the urgent needs of people affected by the fighting in Libya . '' \n`` As long as the conflict in Libya continues , the outlook for the coming months is dire , and living conditions may further deteriorate for a large percentage of the population , '' said Boris Michel , ICRC head of operations for North and West Africa . \nThe Council of the European Union reiterated its call Monday for the protection of civilians , a cease-fire and identifying Gadhafi as `` a threat to the Libyan people . '' \nCatherine Ashton , the European Union 's foreign policy chief , was to detail on Monday meetings with Libya 's rebel leaders a day after opening an office in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nAshton was to brief the EU 's foreign ministers about weekend meetings where she pledged support from the 27-nation union to the chairman of Libya 's Transitional National Council . \n`` I am here today to explain and be clear about the depth and breadth of our support in the European Union for the people of Libya , '' Ashton said in a statement Sunday by the EU shortly after her meeting with Mustafa Abdul Jalil , the transitional council chairman . \nDuring the meeting , Ashton said she and Jalil discussed security reform , border management , the economy and civil society . \nArrest warrants have been issued by the International criminal Court for Gadhafi and two relatives , linking them to `` widespread and systematic '' attacks on civilians as they struggle to retain power in Libya . \nThe court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , has said that the court in The Hague will investigate allegations of institutionalized rape in the war-torn country . \nA Libyan government official told CNN that Gadhafi 's government welcomes the court 's investigation but said that prosecutors `` have not been to Libya to do an investigation . '' \nSiham Sergewa , a Libyan psychologist , has been collecting reports of women reportedly raped and beaten by Gadhafi ` sforces that she says she is sharing with the criminal court . \nSergewa told CNN 's Sara Sidner that she began collecting the reports after receiving a call from the mother of a patient in Ajdabiya , a town in eastern Libya that was the scene of some of the earliest fighting between rebels and government forces . \nThe mother told Sergewa that she had been abducted by three or four men and taken to the desert where she was raped . \nSince then , Sergewa told CNN she has collected surveys from more than 270 women at refugee camps along Libya 's borders with Egypt and Tunisia who allege they were assaulted by Gadhafi forces . \nCNN 's Nima Elbagir , Amir Ahmed , Nic Robertson and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report .

'' \nGermany has not participated in the NATO-led military effort in Libya and abstained from the U.N. Security Council vote that authorized military action to protect civilians from Gadhafi 's forces . \nBut German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in June that her country shares the hope `` that this NATO mission is successful .

'' \nMarshaling e-mails , interviews and documents , the lawmakers said : `` In effect , it appears that BP repeatedly chose risky procedures in order to reduce costs and save time , and made minimal efforts to contain the added risk .

'' \n-LRB- W -RRB- ho cares , it 's done , end of story , will probably be fine and we 'll get a good cement job , '' he wrote . \nCocales could not be reached to comment Monday , and Andrew Gowers , a company spokesman , said only that `` it would be inappropriate for us to comment ahead of the hearing .

'' \nThat cost to BP will dwarf whatever amounts its rig workers were worried about . \nWhite House officials were working to strike a deal with the oil giant on a multibillion-dollar escrow account to compensate victims , administration advisers said . \nLed by White House counsel Robert F. Bauer , administration negotiators were hoping to finish an agreement before the meeting Wednesday . \nObama called talks `` constructive . '' \nOne potential area of disagreement loomed : whether the escrow account would be limited or whether it could be replenished , as the administration is demanding . \nBP is also seeking assurance that money be used only for reasonable or `` legitimate '' claims through an impartial administrator . \nInvestment analysts expect that BP might suspend or reduce its dividend to fund an escrow account that some lawmakers have demanded be as large as $ 20 billion . \n`` Suspending the dividend would significantly reduce the political heat on BP and enhance its financial flexibility , '' said Fadel Gheit , an oil analyst at Oppenheimer . \n`` BP can raise $ 20 billion in escrow account within days . '' \nMeanwhile , rival oil companies , worried about new regulations or limits on deepwater drilling off U.S. coasts , began openly criticizing BP . \n`` What we do know is that when you properly design wells for the range of risk anticipated ; follow established procedures ; build in layers of redundancy ; properly inspect and maintain equipment ; train personnel ; conduct tests and drills ; and focus on safe operations and risk management , tragic incidents like the one in the Gulf of Mexico today should not occur , '' Kenneth P. Cohen , Exxon Mobil 's vice president of public and government affairs , said in a blog . \nBut Exxon Mobil 's criticism paled next to the 14-page letter that Rep. Henry A. Waxman -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- \n, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , and Rep. Bart Stupak -LRB- D-Mich . -RRB- \n, chairman of the panel 's subcommittee on oversight and investigations , sent to BP chief executive Tony Hayward , who will testify before the committee Thursday . \nAfter reviewing documents and interviews the committee obtained , the two lawmakers said that `` BP appears to have made multiple decisions for economic reasons that increased the danger of a catastrophic well failure .

Xavier Becerra -LRB- D-Calif . -RRB- \n, Cavuto noted that the congressman pushed for more minority lending to `` folks who heretofore could n't get mortgages '' and asked , `` Are you totally without culpability here ? \nAre you totally blameless ? '' \nDefenders of the act say claims that it encouraged risky loans and caused the foreclosure crisis do not square with the facts of subprime lending . \nOnly a tiny fraction of subprime loans made since 2000 were ever generated to meet the goals of the act , which requires banks and savings-and-loan institutions to provide credit to their lower-income clients as well as their wealthy ones , they said . \nJohn Taylor , president and chief executive of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition , an umbrella group that promotes access to credit and affordable housing , said such claims `` are on the level of Swift boat advertisements , except they are even less factual .

{"txt": "OCEAN SPRINGS , Miss. -- The law firm of Kenneth Feinberg , the man in charge of BP 's $ 20 billion compensation fund for Gulf oil spill victims , has so far been paid about $ 3.35 million from BP PLC to dole out the money , the program said Thursday . \nFeinberg 's firm has been operating independently of the oil giant since the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that triggered the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . \nBut Gulf coast residents who have been demanding transparency in the claims process have been eager to know how much Feinberg is earning , For some , the revelation of significant fees from BP are undermining Feinberg 's claims that he is operating independently of the oil giant . \n`` There 's no doubt in my mind that he 's working for BP , '' said Louisiana shrimp processor Dean Blanchard . \n`` He can say he 's independent , but he 's working for BP and he 's low-balling all of us , the people affected the most . '' \nBP PLC agreed to pay Kenneth Feinberg 's firm , Feinberg Rozen LLP , $ 850,000 a month starting in mid-June , according to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , which has been set up to compensate fishermen , business owners , residents and other Gulf Coast victims of the April 20 well blowout that killed 11 rig workers and spewed more than 170 million gallons of oil into the sea . \nThe claims facility on Thursday told The Associated Press the bill for the firm 's services is now up to about $ 3.35 million , and Feinberg 's firm will continue to receive $ 850,000 a month from BP through the end of the year , after which the contract will be reviewed . \nClaims spokeswoman Amy Weiss declined comment on the payment details , referring AP to an Oct. 8 report from former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey , whose own firm , Debevoise & Plimpton LLP , was hired by Feinberg 's office to review the deal . \n`` The firm 's work on the -LRB- Gulf Coast Claims Facility -RRB- is largely unprecedented , '' Mukasey wrote in his report . \n`` The assignment is to allocate the largest claims fund in American history and to do so under both intense time pressure and public scrutiny . '' \nMukasey wrote that the fees being charged to BP by Feinberg 's firm are warranted given the enormous task . \n`` The engagement commands a substantial commitment of the firm 's personnel and resources , '' he wrote . \nAs of Nov. 3 , the claims fund had paid victims about $ 1.7 billion , though many across the coast are still awaiting checks or say they have been paid too little and are struggling to keep up with bills after a summer of lost revenue . \nThe facility has received about 337,000 claims for compensation . \nAbout 97,000 have been paid or approved for payment . \nAnother 97,000 claimants have filed requests for money but have provided no documentation to back up their losses , according to Feinberg . \nThe claims fund is denying many of those filings outright . \nTo date , about 32,000 claimants have been denied . \nVictims have until Nov. 23 to file for emergency payments to help keep them afloat . \nAfter that , they must submit a claim for a final settlement from BP . \nBy doing that , they must give up their right to ever sue BP . \nPresident Barack Obama tapped Feinberg , who previously oversaw money doled out to 9\\/11 victims , to run the BP claims fund , which the London-based company created under government pressure to ensure that it paid those hurt by the spill . \nFeinberg is paid by BP , but he insists he is operating the fund independently and remains an advocate for Gulf Coast residents and is n't influenced at all by the oil giant in the process . \nThe claims facility said Thursday the firm 's fees are being paid directly by BP and are not coming from the compensation fund . \nThe program declined to say how much Feinberg is making personally , just that the fee is being paid to his firm . \nFeinberg took over the claims process from BP in August .

{"txt": "LONDON | Tue Mar 8 , 2011 12:52 pm EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan oil trade has virtually been paralyzed as banks decline to clear payments in dollars due to U.S. sanctions , trading sources told Reuters on Tuesday . \nThe move follows a decision by major U.S. oil firms to halt trade with Libya and makes it almost impossible for European firms to buy Libyan oil and supply refineries in countries such as France and Italy . \nAround half of Libya 's oil output , or more than 1 percent of global supply , has already been choked off by lethal clashes between rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi . \n`` Banks do n't want to finance the system in Libya , so for the moment no one is getting money for oil . \nThere are big problems for payments , '' said a senior trader with a European oil company . \n \n`` It 's very difficult to get payments in dollars because of the sanctions , '' he said unnamed . \nGoldman Sachs bank said OPEC 's spare capacity to cushion lost output was much smaller than thought . \nSources at or close to major European buyers of Libyan crude , including Italy 's Eni , ERG , Total and Saras , said the decision by banks to stop export financing of Libyan crude had virtually brought all transactions to a halt . \n`` It 's not a matter of choice , there is an embargo on U.S. dollars coming in and out of Libya , '' said a trader with one of the firms , referring to banks ' resistance to clear payments in the U.S. currency . \n`` All U.S. dollar transactions are being blocked , '' the trader said , adding it was not clear at this stage if payments were possible in other currencies and whether any Swiss or European banks were willing to conclude transactions . \nWestern countries , the European Union and United Nations have imposed sanctions on Libya and frozen government assets in response to forces loyal to Gaddafi firing on protesters . \n`` Sometimes it is easier not to trade at all than to trade with many caveats , '' said an oil trader working for a major international bank , adding EU 's law interpretations could reopen some paths for trade in the long-term . \n`` If you can prove that money from oil purchased goes back to accounts not controlled by Gadaffi and family , perhaps you could argue that you are buying oil for humanitarian purposes and that the money would flow back into the country , '' he said . \nMost estimates suggest around half of Libya 's 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of oil production capacity has been suspended due to clashes between government forces and rebels . \n`` A virtually complete shut-in of Libyan crude production until the civil-war situation clarifies , or until peace is restored , is therefore now under way , '' said Samuel Ciszuk from IHS consultancy . \n`` Fears over sanctions are doing their part to isolate the Libyan regime . '' \nSome European countries such as France and Italy heavily rely on Libyan crude imports and will be looking for ways to restore supplies as quickly as possible . \n`` The loss of Libyan light-sweet crude poses a threat to the profitability of Europe 's already troubled refining industry , '' JBC consultancy said in a note . \n`` This is due to the fact that refineries rely heavily on high quality crudes to produce value-added products and minimize expensive processing , '' it added . \nHowever , Ciszuk said shippers may refrain from approaching Libyan oil ports because of fighting and will be in no hurry to return as long as insurers at the Lloyd 's of London insurance market classify Libya as a high risk , or a war-zone destination . \n`` Insurance premiums play a significant role in the cost of crude shipping and escalated premiums for Libya mean that crude from other parts of the Middle East and North Africa , where sufficient capacity exists to replace Libyan output , instantly become more attractive , '' he said .

{"txt": "Mexicans still haunted by 1979 Ixtoc spill By Julian Miglierini BBC News , Campeche , Mexico The Ixtoc well was drilling at 150ft compared with Deepwater Horizon at 5,000 ft If the worried inhabitants of the southern coast of the US wonder what long-term effects the BP oil spill will have on their livelihoods and the environment , they could come to the Mexican state of Campeche to find answers . \nAn explosion in 1979 at the Ixtoc I platform , located 80km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- off Mexico 's Gulf Coast , caused the largest ever peacetime oil spill . \nIt took Pemex , Mexico 's state-owned oil company , more than nine months to stop the leak , during which time almost 3.3 million barrels of oil had gushed into the sea . \nIt traveled as far as the Texas shoreline . \nThe fire and collapse of the Ixtoc rig is eerily similar to what happened at Deepwater Horizon : in both cases , the blowout preventer failed to function . \nBack in 1979 , Pemex tried several methods to contain the oil that were similar to the procedures recently used by BP . \nThey finally managed to stop it by drilling two relief wells . \nA crucial difference is that the Ixtoc was drilling at a depth of 150ft -LRB- 45m -RRB- , whilst Deepwater blew at 5,000 ft -LRB- 1.5 km -RRB- below the sea . \nBut , as the people of Campeche have learned , blocking the leak is not necessarily the biggest challenge when an oil spill occurs . \nIn the fishing town of Champoton , in the state of Campeche , many people will tell you that the Ixtoc spill marked a turning point in the economy of the area . \n`` The amount of fish to catch was never the same as before the spill , '' says Pablo Bonastre , a veteran fisherman who still remembers the days after the accident when they would catch fish whose eyes were red and almost popping out . \nAnd he vividly recalls the local government giving them `` a pair of boots , a spade and plastic bags '' to help collect the oil from the sea 's surface . \nIn the following months , many fishermen had to find unskilled work on land ; others left town and never returned . \nThe fishermen believe that depleted fish stocks are not just the result of the Ixtoc spill but of pollution caused by the area 's burgeoning oil industry , which has helped make Mexico one of the world 's top 10 oil producers . \nThe wider environmental impact of the Ixtoc oil spill is uncertain . \nA series of studies have argued that several factors reduced that impact considerably , among them , the high sea temperatures , which helped the oil evaporate , and the sea currents in the area . \nTraces from the Ixtoc oil spill allegedly still remain on Mexico 's coastline A 1985 report by Mexico 's National Autonomous University concluded that the effect of the spill was limited . \nThe Ixtoc spill , it explains , `` despite being of great proportions did not -LRB- ... -RRB- cause the deadly environmental impact over the diverse communities and elements that make up the Campeche Sound . '' \nBut another study , carried out by Swedish researchers in 1981 , appears to contradict that view . \n`` The oil from the Ixtoc I blow-out acutely affected the species and ecosystems in the Campeche Bay area through its chemical toxicity -LRB- in the vicinity of the well -RRB- and through its physical properties -LRB- stickiness -RRB- in a larger area offshore and along the coast , '' that study says . \nBeyond the academic debate , locals are adamant that the most obvious evidence of Ixtoc 's legacy are the black , rock-like formations of solidified oil that can be found in parts of the Campeche coast . \nThose were not here before the Ixtoc spill , they say . \nMany in Mexico believe that the Ixtoc episode could not only provide clues to the possible effects of the BP oil slick , but also offer more immediate guidance . \nAt the time of the Ixtoc crisis , Carlos Osornio was the chief offshore drilling engineer for Pemex and was part of the team trying to contain the leak . \nFrom those moments of tension and uncertainty he has this advice for the engineers at BP . \n`` My recommendation would be to build two relief wells , '' he told the BBC . \n`` It is the only and final solution they have . '' \nNo doubt those efforts to stop the flow of oil will be followed closely by the residents of the Campeche coast . \nThey fear that a busy hurricane season and changing currents could push some of the oil leaking from the BP rig to their shores - bringing with it the painful memories of Ixtoc , 30 years on . \nYou can listen to Does Nature Recover , Rajesh Mirchandani 's report from Mexico , on World Service Radio at 1100GMT , or watch it on BBC World News at 1100GMT on Monday 14 June . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

personalities and music , writer and musician Banning Eyre embarks on his own Appalachian road trip to discover the American folk music that was born there in the 18th and 19th centuries . \nHe visits the small town of Mount Airy in Surry County , North Carolina , where he meets the extraordinary players and singers keeping this music alive , and finds out how `` old time '' music is the direct precursor of what is now called country and bluegrass . \nIn an interview with musician and field recordist Mike Seeger , recorded just a few months before he died , Banning discovers the roots of the music in the parallel histories of the European settlers and African slaves . \nHe finds out how , post-emancipation , a distinctly American music was forged from the interplay of the African banjo and the European fiddle . \nBanning then embarks on a cross-state journey to hear the music and the stories of some of the older players and singers who can trace a direct line back to before the age of the radio and gramophone , to when this music was a strictly oral tradition . \nBanning meets 90-year-old fiddler Jo Thomson -- perhaps the only known surviving old time , African-American stringband player . \nHis playing and stories capture a period of time before the music was delineated on race grounds . \nBanning also meets eighth-generation ballad singer Sheila Kay Adams . \nShe

treaty , Elizabeth is suddenly forced to marry Carlo 's father , the severe , old Spanish king , Philip II . \nCarlo is devastated and searches for a new role as liberator of Flanders . \nThe title role is taken by one of today 's most admired tenors , Jonas Kaufmann , with soprano Marina Poplavskaya as Elizabeth of Valois and Ferruccio Furlanetto as Philip II of Spain . \nAround this tragic central triangle is a wider confrontation between authoritarian religion , represented by John Tomlinson 's Grand Inquisitor , and political liberation , represented by Carlo 's closest friend , the Marquis of Posa , sung by Simon Keenlyside . \nSaturday Play -- Emil And The Detectives The cast of Emil And The Detectives , Joshua Swinney -LRB- Emil -RRB- center front , clockwise from Emil ,

Sandbrook , without any anniversary peg to speak of , sets out on a mission to understand the compelling appeal of the anniversary . \nDominic tries to uncover why marking anniversaries appears to be so appealing to newspapers , radio and television networks as well as to the general population . \nHe looks at major national events , such as commemorating war , which pre-dates broadcasting . \nHe compares programs , over a series of anniversary dates , to see what changes and what remains the same . \nThe Second World War provides a vivid example . \nTen years later , the 1955 response is limited but triumphal . \nBut 60 years on and there 's a far greater energy in the remembering and rediscovering , particularly in terms of the details that did n't seem to matter at the time . \nThen

, Principal of St Anne 's College , Oxford , confronts the response to death in 21st-century Britain . \nHe reflects on how people deal with death as a society and considers the relationship between those who have gone and those who are left behind . \nMost people can remember their first funeral . \nEveryone can remember the first time they saw someone who had died . \nBut how we respond to death and our own mortality varies greatly in multi-cultural Britain . \nIn the first program , Tim meets two teenagers who created their own ritual for their friend Dan , who died suddenly in a road accident . \nHe hears from a 70-year-old Hindu who is challenging British law in order to secure the right to have an open funeral pyre in the UK when he dies . \nAnd Tim encounters death first-hand when he joins with a Muslim family at their ritual washing and burial of their father\\/grandfather which traditionally takes place within 24 hours of death . \nIn the second program he finds out that people often go far beyond a lock of hair or piece of jewellery as a keepsake of a loved one . \nTim attends the National Funeral Exhibition and encounters an industry where physical immortality is now marketed as a desirable commodity to those who have lost their belief in life after death , but who are terrified of oblivion . \nHe finds out that human , or indeed animal , ashes are now made into diamonds , paperweights and wind chimes . \nRunaway Train is the remarkable story of railwayman Wesley McDonald who was recorded on his train as it hurtled down a mountain . \nThe 20-minute recording reveals the radio conversation Wesley had with his line manager as he tried to make the terrible decision of whether he should jump from the train or take his chances and hang on . \nBut the longer he vacillates , the faster the train is speeding down the mountain track , and the fewer his chances of survival . \nWesley found himself stuck on his train hurtling down a mountainside from a mine in New Brunswick , Canada , in 1987 . \nHe decided not to jump and the train derailed at about 70mph . \nThe recording captures the moment when he was found by his colleagues , miraculously unscathed . \nJohn Hurt narrates this two-part adaptation of EM Forster 's classic , Howards End . \nWhen the headstrong and impetuous Helen Schlegel sends a telegram to her sister announcing she has fallen in love with Paul Wilcox , she sparks a collision between two very different families : The Schlegels are intellectual , sensitive to the arts , idealistic and compassionate . \nThe Wilcox family , by contrast , are materialistic , practical , unimaginative and very rich . \nThe short-lived romance comes to an end but Helen 's elder sister Margaret forms an uncomfortable but genuine bond with Mrs Wilcox , who is ill and dies . \nThe late Mrs Wilcox had scribbled a last request that her beloved house , Howards End , be left to Margaret Wilcox . \nThe family , however , has disregarded and destroyed this note . \nHowards End is a timeless story concerned with relationships and the possibility of reconciliation between pairs of opposites : the prose and the passion , the practical mind and the intellect , the outer life and the inner . \nThis radio adaptation by Amanda Dalton stars Lisa Dillon as Margaret Schlegel ; Jill Cardo as Helen Schlegel ; Tom Ferguson as Tibby Shlegel ; Malcolm Raeburn as Henry Wilcox ; Ann Rye as Ruth Wilcox ; and Joseph Kloska as Charles Wilcox . \n12.00noon-5 .00 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Colin Murray presents an afternoon of live sport plus

celebrates the centenary of clarinet virtuoso and band-leader Benny Goodman , born on 30 May 1909 , in a new , six-part series , written by Russell Davies . \nFor generations , Goodman was known to the world as The King Of Swing -- a title awarded to him in the Thirties -- but he was much more than that . \nGoodman was one of the finest clarinet players in the world and practiced his art at the highest levels in both jazz and classical music . \nHe was a band-leader who strove for , and achieved , perfection through tireless rehearsals of the various jazz ensembles he created over the decades . \nHe was also a driven and complex man . \nDespite the fact that he died more than two decades ago , in 1986 , stories of his unpredictable behavior are legendary . \nThis series features new interviews with jazz critic Gary Giddins ; Professor Dan Morgenstern of the Institute for Jazz Studies at Rutgers University ; clarinettist and saxophonist Ken Peplowski ; Loren Schoenberg , executive director of the Jazz Museum in Harlem ; singer Louise Tobin ; Sir John Dankworth ; and writer John Hancock . \nThere are also rare archive contributions from Goodman himself ; Peggy Lee ; Buddy Greco ; Rachel Goodman ; Carol Phillips ; boyhood friend Jim Maher ; biographer Ross Firestone ; record executives John Hammond and Alan Livingston ; band-leaders Artie Shaw , Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton ; clarinettist Bob Wilber ; saxophonists Jerry Jerome , Noni Bernardi , Danny Bank and Walt Levinsky ; drummers Louis Bellson , Nick Fatool , Johnny Blowers , Mel Lewis and Bobby Rosengarden ; trumpeter Jimmy Maxwell ; trombonist Milt Bernhart ; and singers Helen Forrest and Lynn Roberts . \nTonight 's opener charts Goodman 's early years and covers him mastering the clarinet , working for drummer\\/band-leader Ben Pollack and concludes in 1928 with Goodman about to leave Chicago , heading for New York . \nKirill Karabits conducts the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra in a concert recorded at the Lighthouse , Poole , earlier this year . \nDebussy 's heady portrait of a sultry sun-infused afternoon of a faun is considered one of the key works of musical history , as tonality loosens its grip among the mythical glades of nymphs , naiads and fauns . \nStravinsky 's The Rite Of Spring is also a seminal work and Debussy -- who premired the four-hand piano version with the composer -- was a great admirer of the younger man 's piece , admitting that the Rite haunted him `` like a beautiful nightmare '' . \nRachmaninov 's Piano Concert No. 2 -- made famous by its use in the soundtrack to Brief Encounter -- is performed by Russian pianist Vadim Rudenko . \nIt was composed in 1900 after a period of severe writer 's block , which was only overcome after Rachmaninov began a course of auto-suggestive therapy with psychologist Nikolai Dahl , to whom the concerto is dedicated . \nThis is followed by the start of a week of performances given by the Northern Sinfonia , ahead of BBC Radio 3 's Free Thinking Festival , which takes place at The Sage , Gateshead , from 23-25 October . \nBook Of The Week -- Blaze Of Obscurity Ep 1\\/5 Monday 19 to Friday 23 October Clive James reads from his fifth volume of memoirs -- The TV Years -- in this new Book Of The Week offering , which covers his most prominent period on TV . \nFor many people , Clive James will always be a TV presenter first and foremost , and a writer second , despite the fact that his adventures with the written word took place before , during and after his time on the small screen . \nNevertheless , for those who remember clips of Japanese endurance game shows and Egyptian soap operas ; Clive reinventing the news or interviewing Hefner and Hepburn , Polanski and Pavarotti ; Clive 's `` Postcards '' from Kenya , Shanghai and Dallas ; or Clive James Racing Driver , Clive 's rightful place does seem to be on the box . \nMonday 19 to Friday 23 October The Dead Hour , a new , 10-part dramatisation by Chris Dolan from a novel by Denise Mina , is set in Glasgow in 1984 , and forms this new Woman 's Hour Drama offering . \nIn the middle of the night , plucky young journalist Paddy Meehan and her driver , Billy , chase ambulances and police cars , hoping for a story , and investigate the death of a lawyer in one of Glasgow 's most exclusive suburbs . \nWhen the police are called to a domestic disturbance at an imposing detached house in the exclusive conservation district of Bearsden , Paddy is quick to follow them up the secluded garden path . \nVhari Burnett is a top lawyer , but that has n't stopped her from being beaten up , or so it seems . \nWhen her partner opens the door he claims there has been a misunderstanding . \nThe next day , Vhari is found dead . \nDriven by her nose for a story and wracked by guilt at her own apparent complicity , Paddy 's investigations reveal two middle-class sisters caught up in a world of violence , drug-dealing and East End gangs . \nAs the story spirals , Paddy herself faces increasing danger . \nThe cast is to be confirmed closer to transmission . \nShari Vahl meets some of the trainees on the National Graduate Development Programme , set up to encourage bright graduates to do a job they might not previously have considered -- working for the council -- in a new , three-part series .

career with a high-street fashion retailer for a job in local government , and is trying to bring the dynamism of the business world into her new role . \nShari also meets Dominic Campbell , who was running a team of more than 20 people by the age of 26 at a local authority , but left to set up a consultancy . \nIn the second program , Shari meets two dynamic , innovative chief executives to find out why they explode the stereotype of a local authority boss -- Katherine Kerswell , in Northamptonshire , and Sean Harriss , in Bolton , who became a chief executive at just 38 . \nIn the final program of the series , Shari meets chief executives who have left for the national stage , such as Carolyn Downs -- who went from running Shropshire County Council to become deputy permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice . \nFilthy Rich , written by Micheal Butt , forms today 's Afternoon Play offering . \nFor the last five years , since his father 's death , Max has known that on his 30th birthday he would receive a small fortune . \nBut the time he 's had to wait has come at a price -- in order to claim his inheritance he 's had to prove to his grandmother that he 's capable of `` getting on '' with his sister . \nNormally this would n't be the most taxing of trials , but Max and sister Katrin have rarely seen eye to eye . \nEver since he broke the neck of her parrot when they were children , they 've gone from spat to spat . \nHowever , for the last five years , Max has somehow managed to keep himself in check . \nNow , with only two weeks to go until judgement day , surely nothing can go wrong . \nBut paranoia gets the better of Max when he starts bugging his grandmother 's home , and that 's just the start of his problems . \nThe cast is to be confirmed closer to transmission . \nMonday 19 to Friday 23 October Award-winning historian Professor Amanda Vickery continues to present a history of private life in Britain over 400 years , and this week focuses on the 18th century -- exploring servants , bachelors , spinsters , widows and widowers . \nMany servants did n't have a bed of their own and slept in passageways or across their masters ' doors -- like guard dogs . \nMaids , meanwhile , were notoriously vulnerable to sexually predatory men . \nIn Tuesday 's program , Professor Vickery explores the life of a bachelor in the 17th and 18th centuries . \nLiving outside the family embrace was far from glamorous before the advent of washing machines , microwaves and pre-prepared meals for one . \nBachelorhood was supposed to be a temporary and unprestigious state best solved by marriage . \nThis program tells the poignant and amusing story of law student Dudley Ryder , and his search for a wife . \nWednesday 's program explores the lives of spinsters and reveals that one in five women never married . \nThursday 's program , meanwhile , shows that the lives of widows were very different from spinsters . \nWidows had enormous status and power and , for some , the death of a spouse was a fairy-tale release . \nThis program tells the story of one of England 's richest widows and how she spent her fortune . \nThe final program of the week tells the story of two different widowers and their search for a new wife . \nThis is original material from two unusual sets of diaries which Professor Vickery found in Lincoln . \nOne widower was a surgeon , while the other a solicitor -- a man tortured by guilt because of his relationship with his housekeeper , who he is unable to stop sleeping with . \nPresenter\\/Professor Amanda

the original dilemma to living with the consequences . \nIn this week 's edition of The Choice , Michael talks to Father Aidan Troy , the Catholic priest who played a central role in supporting the pupils of Holy Cross School , Belfast , during protests over their right to walk to school in 2001 . \nAntony Gormley , one of Britain 's leading artists , pays tribute to the sculptor Jacob Epstein on the 50th anniversary of his death . \nEpstein attracted criticism during his career , his work was often seen as being too graphic or hard hitting , too ugly or cannibal . \nAfter his death , fellow sculptor , Henry Moore paid tribute to his courage as a pioneering artist who bore the brunt of critical derision . \nFifty years on , Anthony shows how Epstein revived British sculpture in crucial ways : how he sought inspiration from the ancient , non-Western cultures of Egypt , China and Africa , and how he insisted on `` direct carving '' , where he worked out his ideas straight into the stone . \nBorn on the East Side of New York City in 1880 to Jewish immigrant parents , Jacob Epstein moved to Paris in 1902 , where he absorbed the work of Rodin and saw ancient Egyptian sculpture in the Louvre . \nHe moved to London in 1905 , immediately feeling at home and becoming a British subject . \nHis first significant commission came in 1907 , when he carved 18 figures for the British Medical Association Building in the Strand . \nCompleted the following year , these pieces solidly established the young sculptor 's reputation -- he had numerous private commissions for portraits throughout his career . \nAt this time , Epstein 's passion for direct carving in his own work becomes evident and his subject matter is devoted to major human themes and a search for the primordial , archetypal image . \nFrom modest beginnings in Paris , his keen interest in African sculpture grew and he amassed one of the finest collections of African art in Britain . \nWriter Irma Kurtz sets off on a journey to Paris and Madrid to investigate the period just before the war when blind Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo composed his famous Concerto de Aranjuez . \nThe concerto , one of the most famous pieces of classical music , was written 70 years ago . \nAlthough Rodrigo could n't play the instrument , Spain 's guitar traditions and rhythms are ever present in the music . \nMany people particularly love the middle movement , `` Adagio '' . \nRodrigo said he wanted to evoke `` the fragrance of magnolias '' , `` the song of birds and the gushing of fountains '' . \nIrma analyses how place and time affected the composition and also offers a psychological analysis of the composer 's life in pre-wartime Paris and Madrid and how his make-up can be heard in his music . \nIrma , who has lived in both Spain and Paris , has long had a fascination for Rodrigo 's music . \nShe travels to Paris and Madrid to talk to Rodrigo 's family , including his daughter Cecilia Rodrigo , the eminent guitarist Pepe Romero and Henri Heugel of the Ecole Normale de Musique in Paris , where Rodrigo studied . \nIrma also visits the family home in Madrid and the gardens at Aranjuez . \nIrma 's

working as a cameraman for Al Jazeera , on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border . \nHe believes that he was taken as a result of mistaken identity , and sold to the Americans by Pakistan for the sake of a

on agriculture , has been widely reported . \nLess well known is the serious decline of the bumblebee , whose role is just as important in pollinating many crops and flowers that honeybees do n't touch . \nThis program looks at the efforts being made across the UK to find reasons for the plight of the bumblebee , to conserve the most threatened species and even reverse the trend . \nAlso featured is the world 's first working bumblebee sniffer dog , trained to find their elusive nests , a vital part of the research . \nMuch less abundant than honeybees , bumblebees pollinate the countryside out of all proportion to their numbers . \nThey get to work early in the year , in the rain and the cold , while their better-known cousins shelter in their hives , and many bumblebee species have long tongues that mean they can get into flowers that honeybees ca n't pollinate . \nThe most important beneficiaries include soft fruits like strawberries and blueberries , so much so that Scottish fruit growers are importing bumblebee nests from Holland to counteract the decline . \nHowever , this greatly worries experts who fear they could import disease , and argue that efforts should go into boosting native species . \n6.30-10 .30 pm BBC RADIO 5 LIVE Mark Pougatch presents live second-half commentary of CSKA Moscow versus Manchester United in the Champions League , from

work of American artist Ed Ruscha , the young novelist Bidisha asks how people should read words by artists . \nFiona Banner writes stories but she 's not a writer -- she 's an artist who writes them directly onto gallery walls . \nShe 's following in a tradition of artists who have made art out of words . \nRichard Long goes on long walks but in the gallery the art work is a pile of stones and a list of words evoking his walk . \nIan Hamilton Finlay made his name carving words onto stones and creating a garden of words at his home in Scotland . \nBidisha investigates where the dividing line lies between art and writing : She spends time sitting in a gallery to see whether people actually read the art works inscribed on the walls or simply pass through looking for the next picture . \nAn

'' \nsaid the report , which was published on Citigroup 's investigative website . \nThe company has a market value of $ 152.6 billion , bolstered by a global marketing network , a lucrative oil venture in Russia , a promising contract to boost production in a giant Iraqi field and scores of other large interests . \nIt remains the largest oil producer in the Gulf of Mexico . \nMeasured by revenue or assets , it is among the world 's five largest companies . \nCitigroup analysts said stockholders ' reactions seem `` disproportionate to the likely costs to the company . '' \nIt noted that punitive damages against Exxon for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil-tanker spill were originally set at $ 5 billion in 1994 but were reduced on appeal . \nThe company agreed last year to pay less than $ 1 billion , including interest . \nFor now , at least , BP 's prodigious costs combating the oil spill in the Gulf are outweighed by prodigious profits . \nOn Monday , BP said it spent $ 350 million in the first 20 days of the spill response , about $ 17.5 million a day . \nIt has paid 295 of the 4,700 claims received , for a total of $ 3.5 million . \nBy contrast , in the first quarter of the year , the London-based oil giant 's profits averaged $ 93 million a day . \nThe amount of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico has been estimated at 5,000 to 25,000 barrels a day . \nIn the first quarter , BP produced 2.5 million barrels of crude oil a day worldwide -- and it received $ 71.86 for every barrel . \nBP has strong borrowing capacity , too . \nAnalysts say it could get as much as $ 20 billion without exceeding its debt targets . \n`` Even a pretty large digging into the pockets would be within our capacity to handle , '' said Andrew Gowers , a BP spokesman . \nThe company does , however , have large needs -- with a $ 20 billion capital spending plan for this year and $ 8.4 billion needed for acquisitions , mainly of assets from Devon Energy . \nNow , cleanup costs must be added . \nRelief wells being drilled to intercept the damaged one could cost more than $ 100 million each . \nScores of lawsuits have been filed . \nLegislation passed in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez accident makes BP and its partners responsible for cleanup costs and up to $ 75 million in damages . \nBP officials said Monday that they expect to exceed that . \n`` A $ 75 million liability is not where our head is at this moment , '' said David Nagel , an executive vice president . \nOn Friday , Standard & Poor 's affirmed BP 's credit rating but revised its outlook to `` Negative '' from `` Stable . '' \n`` Provided BP can stem the well and clean the spill within a reasonable time , the company has adequate liquidity and financial headroom to meet immediate costs , '' said a report by S&P credit analyst Simon Redmond . \n`` However , it is still too early to estimate with any degree of confidence the full future impact on BP from the spill . '' \nBP will survive , analysts say , but damage caused by the rig disaster that killed 11 workers was still huge . \nFadel Gheit , an oil analyst at Oppenheimer , said the accident was `` a major disaster with catastrophic implications not only for the companies involved , but also for the offshore oil industry and the economies of the Gulf Coast .

But protesters , refugees in Turkey and human rights activists said some soldiers in the northwest had refused to shoot at protesters and fighting had broken out between loyalist and mutinous forces this week . \nThe nature of the alleged `` terrorist groups '' was unclear . \nAuthorities have repeatedly tried to portray anti-government protesters as armed and violent . \nBut protesters , refugees in Turkey and rights activists said some soldiers in the northwest had refused to shoot at protesters and fighting had broken out between loyalist and mutinous forces this week . \n`` There were peaceful protests today -LRB- in Maaret -RRB- calling for freedom and for the downfall of the regime , '' one demonstrator said by phone . \n`` The security forces let us protest , but when they saw the size of the demonstration grow , they opened fire to disperse us . '' \n`` During the protest , two officers and three soldiers refused to open fire so we carried them on our shoulders . \nAfter that , we were surprised to see helicopters firing on us . '' \nA 40-year-old man who had fled across the border into Turkey from Jisr al-Shughour with a bullet still in his thigh also described mutiny in Syrian ranks . \n`` Some of the security forces defected and there were some in the army who refused the orders of their superiors , '' he said . \n`` They were firing on each other . '' \nHuman rights activists aired a YouTube video purporting to be from a Lieutenant Colonel Hussein Armoush saying he had defected with soldiers to `` join the ranks of the masses demanding freedom and democracy . \n`` We had sworn in the armed forces to direct our fire at the enemy and not on our own defenceless people . \nOur duty is to protect citizens and not to kill them , '' he said in the video , whose authenticity could not be immediately verified . \nFifty-seven Syrians from Jisr al-Shughour were in hospital in Turkey , its state-run Anatolian news agency said on Friday . \nAhmad Abdellatif , 27 , who lay paralysed in hospital with three bullet wounds , said Syrian military intelligence agents on rooftops had fired on him and other unarmed people who assembled in a public garden after a funeral for a protester . \nAbu Ata , who was shot in the back , said he had been among uniformed Red Crescent workers aiding mourners at another funeral this week when they came under fire from rooftops . \n`` It was a deliberate hit aimed to kill , '' he said . \nThe northwest border area , like other protest hotspots , is prone to tension between majority Sunni Muslims and Assad 's Alawite sect , which dominates the Syrian power elite . \nThe Jisr al-Shughour violence may hint at splits within security forces , where commanders are mainly Alawite and conscripts Sunni , that would increase the risk of Syria descending into civil war . \nElsewhere in Syria tens of thousands of people marched to call for the overthrow of the president . \n`` Long live Syria , down with Bashar al-Assad ! '' \nSecurity forces shot dead at least two demonstrators taking part in a rally in the Qaboun district of the capital Damascus , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . \nSome troops fired from rooftops at marchers , activists said . \nResidents said government forces also killed two protesters in the village of Busra al-Harir in the southern Hauran plain and fired on thousands defying a heavy security presence in the southern city of Deraa , fount of the three-month-old revolt . \n`` There was a demonstration of 1,000 people when security police fired from their cars , '' a Busra al-Harir resident said , giving the names of the dead as Abdelmuttaleb al-Hariri and Adnan al-Hariri . \nThe latter was an amputee , residents said . \nHowever , state television said unidentified gunmen killed a member of the security forces and a civilian in Busra al-Harir . \nAnother protester was shot dead in the Mediterranean port city of Latakia , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said . \nA Turkish newspaper said Ankara was looking into creating a buffer zone along the border as a contingency if hundreds of thousands of Syrians were drive out by the military campaign to stamp out protests against 41 years of Assad family domination . \nDemonstrators demanding the `` downfall of the regime '' and chanting slogans in support of compatriots in Jisr al-Shughour took to the streets in the oil-producing eastern province of Deir al-Zor , the central cities of Hama and Homs , the main Mediterranean port of Latakia and the Tabaqa region on the Euphrates River in Raqqa province , activists and residents said . \nTens of thousands of people marched unchallenged in Hama , they said , well above the turnout of the previous Friday when security forces killed at least 70 protesters . \nProtests were also reported in five Damascus suburbs , Syria 's second largest city Aleppo and Maarat al-Numan near Jisr al-Shughour , but their size was not immediately clear . \nInhabitants said at least 15,000 troops along with some 40 tanks and troop carriers had deployed near Jisr al-Shughour . \n`` Jisr al-Shughour is practically empty . \nPeople were not going to sit and be slaughtered like lambs , '' said one refugee who crossed on Wednesday and who gave his name as Mohammad . \nResidents said troops and armored vehicles heading for the town had stormed Sarmaniya village , 10 km -LRB- six miles -RRB- south of Jisr al-Shughour , and cut off the region 's communications . \n`` They began as usual by firing heavy machineguns into the village . \nBut the people of Sarmaniya had mostly left . \nHundreds of troops and security forces have defected in the last several days . \nThey -LRB- pro-Assad forces -RRB- might be thinking that they will find some in Sarmaniya , '' said the witness , who was speaking by phone from the outskirts of Jisr al-Shughour . \nRED CROSS CALL FOR ACCESS The International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- ICRC -RRB- urged Syria to allow its aid workers wider access to the civilian population without further delay , including people who have been wounded or detained in the military clampdown on public dissent . \nRights groups say over 1,100 civilians have been killed since March in the revolt to demand more political freedoms and an end to corruption and poverty . \n`` Whether Assad still has the legitimacy to govern his own country , I think is a question everyone needs to consider , '' said U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Friday . \nBritain , France , Germany and Portugal have asked the U.N. Security Council to condemn Assad , although veto-wielding Russia has said it would oppose such a move as counter-productive . \nWorld powers have shown no appetite for any Libya-style military intervention in Syria because it sits on a major fault line of Middle East conflict , allied with Iran against nearby Israel . \nThe Syrian leadership has shrugged off mild punitive sanctions imposed so far , and verbal reprimands from abroad . \nAt the Yayladagi refugee camp in Turkey , nestled in a scenic valley close to the Syrian frontier , children played football while families sat talking under trees sheltering them from the baking Middle East summer sun . \nPolice kept journalists away . \nTurkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan reiterated on Thursday that Turkey would keep its gates open to people from Syria . \nBut he complained that Damascus was taking the issue `` very lightly '' and Ankara could not defend its `` inhumane '' reply to the unrest . \nAssad , 45 , has promised reforms , even while cracking down on unrest posing the gravest threat to his 11 years of iron rule .

{"txt": "BP spill gives Obama an opportunity to reform oil The BP oil spill gives Obama a chance in his Oval Office speech tonight to reform oil use , says Daniel J. Weiss President Barack Obama has made four trips to visit gulf state communities affected by the BP disaster and now plans to give his first-ever Oval Office speech to the nation this Tuesday evening to address the issue . \nThis manmade calamity threatens the nation 's economy , health , and environment . \nThis is also a crucial moment in the BP catastrophe , which threatens to swamp his domestic agenda . \nBut it also provides an opportunity for President Obama to demonstrate leadership by tackling all the aspects of this crisis , including taking charge of the clean up , getting more help from BP , providing long-term public health and economic recovery , and adopting an oil - use and pollution-reduction reform agenda to minimize the likelihood of another catastrophe . \nAmericans are legitimately frustrated and furious about the oil disaster , which has gone on for 55 days and counting . \nThe public has grave concerns about BP 's inability to stop or slow the gusher of oil contaminating the gulf . \nOpinion polls also show that respondents have an unfavorable view of the government 's handling of the disaster . \nThis is undoubtedly due to the government 's inability to get BP to staunch the flood of oil , even though BP has far more advanced technology and oil blow-out experience than the federal government . \nPresident Obama must use his speech to make a compelling and passionate case for comprehensive clean-up measures as well as an oil reform program . \nThis is essential to galvanize public demand for immediate steps to reduce damage from the disaster , as well as more active support for longer-term oil use and pollution reductions . \nThe president should also announce dramatic actions to respond to the oil crisis in the gulf , in the following ways , some of which he has already begun : Take charge of the clean up : Appoint the remaining commissioners to the Bipartisan Demand more help from BP : Stop BP , Transocean , and Halliburton from spending money on their own or American Petroleum Institute lobbyists , ads , or campaign contributions , and instead dedicate all funds to clean up and compensation Provide health and economic aid to people in the gulf region : Establish a Gulf Recovery Fund , a nongovernmental , nonprofit corporation designed to oversee long-term economic recovery in the affected states Prevent future blowouts and disasters : Adopt most of the protective safeguards for deepwater rigs required by other nations Create a federal research program to develop more reliable `` fail safe '' leak prevention hardware and oil containment technologies Reduce oil use and pollution : Implement fuel economy standards and other measures to produce a Power cars with electricity by enacting the Invoke the Trade Expansion Act to levy a small fee on imported oil and use that revenue for public transit , high-speed rail , and other clean infrastructure Adopt a shrinking limit on global warming pollution from oil-based transportation fuels , coal-fired power plants , and other very large sources These measures should be promptly adopted by BP , the administration , or Congress . \nThe president may lack authority to enforce some of the measures aimed at BP . \nThese efforts will require presidential `` jaw boning '' to convince BP to comply , such as when President John F. Kennedy convinced the steel industry to reverse its inflationary price increases . \nWhen President Obama took office , he inherited major problems , including a plunging economy , major industries on the brink of collapse , and two wars . \nThe BP oil disaster 15 months into his term was not of his making , either , but was the result of the Bush-Cheney policies to let big oil police itself . \nDespite the fact that the BP oil disaster is '' Cheney 's Katrina , '' President Obama made it clear that he will `` ultimately take responsibility for solving this crisis . \nI 'm the president and the buck stops with me . '' \nTuesday 's nationwide address provides an opportunity for President Obama to do more than take responsibility . \nHe must firmly put the government -- and not BP -- in charge of all aspects of clean up and recovery . \nMany in Congress would prefer that the president deal with immediate aspects of the disaster , but basically continue business as usual . \nBut he should ignore the special interests and Washington conventional wisdom . \nPresident Obama must use this moment to rally Americans to support a sweeping oil reform agenda that permanently changes the way big oil does business . \nThis means building public demand for standards and investments that deeply cut the $ 1 billion per day spent on foreign oil , ending tax loopholes for big oil companies , and beginning to crack down on global warming pollution . \nAn oil reform agenda would put America back in charge of its energy future . \nPresident Obama must use his inspirational skills to rally support for a 21st century clean energy agenda . \nThe fate of the gulf -- and the rest of the nation -- depends on his success .

This virus can not even mutate into something as bad as the hong kong or asian flu , let alone the spanish influenza of 1918 ! \nIt becomes resistant to tamiflu , which wouldnt be great , but since hardly anyone in the US is being given tamiflu out of the several million suspected cases they have had already , with only 30 deaths or so , most in previously ill people , its really nothing to be incredibly worried about . \nRight now its weaker than regular seasonal flu . \nAnd scientists cant see it getting any worse , it pretty much cant . \nThe media have made the biggest crisis out of this as they can , and im sick of hearing two bit `` experts '' instead of the scientists who actually know about the virus . \nJust my two cents , and Fergus why arent you pointing these things out ? \nI see a lot of very scary headlines and very repetitive trivial news , but not too much in the way of facts ...

{"txt": "AL-UQAYLA , Libya | Thu Mar 3 , 2011 9:59 pm GMT AL-UQAYLA , Libya -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Libyan rebels pushed west on Thursday , extending their grip on a key coast road as Muammar Gaddafi received a warning he would be held to account at The Hague for suspected crimes by his security forces . \nThe United States and the Arab League called for a no-fly zone over Libya to protect civilians from attacks by Gaddafi 's forces . \nBut Gaddafi 's son Saif al Islam said there was no need for any foreign mediation in the crisis , a leader of the uprising rejected talks with the veteran leader , and the Arab League said cautiously the plan was `` under consideration . '' \nIn Paris , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said France and Britain would support the idea of setting up a no-fly zone over Libya if Gaddafi 's forces continued to attack civilians . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said the United States and the international community must be ready to act rapidly to stop violence against civilians or a humanitarian crisis in Libya . \nThe uprising , the bloodiest yet against a long-serving ruler in the Middle East or North Africa , has torn through the OPEC-member country and knocked out nearly 50 percent of its 1.6 million barrels per day output , the bedrock of its economy . \nIn eastern Libya , witnesses said a warplane bombed Brega the oil terminal town 800 km -LRB- 500 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , for the second day , part of a struggle for control of a strategically vital coast road and oil industry facilities . \nWarplanes also launched two raids against the nearby rebel-held town of Ajbadiya , witnesses said . \nBut Juma Amer , Secretary for African Affairs at the Libyan Foreign Ministry , told journalists : `` Media reports that civilian areas were bombed are false . \nPolice had been and are urged to use maximum self restraint . '' \nSaif said Brega was bombed to scare off militia fighters and to gain control of oil installations . \n`` First of all the bombs -LRB- were -RRB- just to frighten them to go away , '' he told Britain 's Sky News . \nOn the ground , rebels leading the unprecedented popular revolt pushed their front line west of Brega . \nThey said they had driven back troops loyal to Gaddafi to Ras Lanuf , site of another major oil terminal and 600 km -LRB- 375 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli . \nThey also said they had captured a group of mercenaries . \nIn an angry scene at al-Uqayla , east of Ras Lanuf , a rebel shouted at a captured young African and alleged mercenary : `` You were carrying guns , yes or no ? \nYou were with Gaddafi 's brigades yes or no ? '' \nThe silent youth was shoved onto his knees into the dirt . \nA man held a pistol close to the boy 's face before a reporter protested and told the man the rebels were not judges . \nIn The Hague , International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Gaddafi and members of his inner circle , could be investigated for alleged crimes committed since the uprising broke out in mid-February . \n`` We have identified some individuals in the de facto or former authority who have authority over the security forces who allegedly committed the crimes , '' Moreno-Ocampo said . \n`` They are Muammar Gaddafi , his inner circle including some of his sons , who had this de facto authority . \nThere are also some people with formal authority who should pay attention to crimes committed by their people . '' \nLibyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told BBC radio the news from The Hague was `` close to a joke . '' \n`` No fact-finding mission has been sent to Libya . \nNo diplomats , no ministers , no NGOs or organizations of any type were sent to Libya to check the facts ... No one can be sent to prison based on media reports , '' he said . \nIbrahim Mohammad Ali , a spokesman for the public security department , said Libya had told the United Nations it would allow visits by independent human rights observers . \nLibya is not a signatory of the ICC treaty , `` but we are willing to deal with the ICC and take action against anyone who has acted outside the law , '' he told a Tripoli news conference . \nA spokesman for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a Gaddafi ally , said the Libyan government had accepted a Venezuelan plan to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict in Libya . \nArab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa said the plan was under consideration and he was waiting for details from Caracas . \nOil prices fell briefly on news of the plan , but traders said the fall was due to profit-taking and they were sceptical about any Venezuelan mediation . \nBrent crude fell more than $ 3 but by 2000 GMT had recovered to $ 114.82 . \nChavez 's plan would involve a commission from Latin America , Europe and the Middle East trying to reach a negotiated outcome between the Libyan leader and rebel forces . \nAn aide to Mustafa Abdel Jalil , head of the rebels ' National Libyan Council , told Reuters the rebels were open to talks only on Gaddafi 's resignation or exile to avoid more bloodshed . \n`` There is nothing else to negotiate , '' he said . \nHe also called for foreign air strikes to set up a `` no-fly zone '' to help the rebels topple Gaddafi . \nSave The Children and Medecins Sans Frontieres said they were struggling to get medicine and care to Libya 's needy , with gunmen blocking roads and civilians too scared to seek help . \nThe government has tried to persuade people in Tripoli that life continues as normal . \nBut there were queues at banks , and residents said food prices had gone up and the street value of the Libyan dinar had fallen dramatically against the dollar . \nThe official news agency said the Libyan parliament had cut car fuel prices by 25 percent to 0.15 dinars -LRB- $ 0.12 -RRB- a litre . \nA fish market near Tripoli 's Green Square was mostly empty . \n`` The situation is affecting us , '' said Ismail , a fisherman . \n`` All the Egyptian workers who run the boats have left . '' \nJust outside rebel-held Zawiyah , west of Tripoli , officials took foreign journalists to a local refinery to show it was controlled by the state . \nOfficials said it was running normally . \nBut in the center of Zawiyah , rebels were fully in control and said they had enough forces to repel any government attack . \nIn the opposition stronghold of Benghazi , men of all ages gathered next to the courthouse engaged in fierce debates , enjoying their new-found freedom of speech . \n`` We must go to Tripoli and get rid of Gaddafi , '' shouted one , to murmurs of approval from those around him . \n`` But we have only our shirts to protect us from the cannon , '' said Ahmed el Sherif , 60 , standing on the edge of the group . \nThe upheaval is causing a humanitarian crisis , especially on the Tunisian border where tens of thousands of foreign workers have fled to safety . \nBut an organized international airlift started to relieve the human flood from Libya as word spread to refugees that planes were taking them home . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nCa n't they remember what happened when the hard line Shah of Iran was deposed with Western influence . \nWe surely need another Iranian regime in Libya , I do n't think . \nThe Arab countries have to have dictators of one sort or another as they are such an unruly lot . \nHistory has proven this over and over . \nI would like to plead to all sides in the current civil war in Libya : Please , do n't go mindlessly blowing up oil wells like Saddam 's forces did when they retreated from Kuwait 20 years ago . \nCap the oil wells , if you must . \nCut us Americans off , if you must . \nCharge whatever you want to charge for a barrel of oil . \nI realize that middle east nations do n't owe us cheap oil . \nBut I earnestly believe it is wrong for humanity to waste billions of barrels of oil by blowing up oil wells . \nYou remind me of those who like in the US and colonial Africa who always wrote blacks are not capable of doing anything good and relatives of monkeys . \nSure only whites know how to start wars ? \nAnd do these dictators have to be appointed as before by our freedom loving governments ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/libyawar_reuters/rsd/LibyaWar_reuters__2011-03-03__4.rsd.txt.sent-fake"}
{"txt": "The rapid growth of the District 's charter school movement , which accounts for more than a third of the city 's public school enrollment , is starting to see signs of cooling because of the national financial crisis , experts in the field say . \nEfforts to expand schools face longer roads to completion , hobbled by a smaller pool of potential investors and higher costs for access to capital . \nCharter schools in the District of Columbia are struggling to raise money to pay for new buildings and renovate old ones , especially in low-income areas . \nThe city 's 60 charter schools , spread over 92 campuses , receive a per-pupil allotment and an annual facilities allowance from the District , which will total about $ 360 million this year for an enrollment of about 26,000 . \nThe private nonprofit groups that run the schools use those funds for operating costs and often turn to bank loans , along with grants , fundraising and investor tax credits , to finance the construction or renovation of buildings . \nLocal school officials said they have not heard of a project that has been scuttled . \nBut even charter schools with track records as effective alternatives to traditional public schools find economic conditions more challenging . \nKIPP DC , which operates four schools in low-income neighborhoods , is trying to line up financing for a $ 23 million renovation of the former Douglass Transition Academy , a closed public school in Ward 8 . \nIt has leased the building as a home for a new high school and early childhood center it wants to open next fall . \nAllison Fansler , KIPP DC 's president and chief operating officer , said this week that financing for the renovation of leased properties is difficult in the best of circumstances because of the lack of collateral for a bank to fall back on if a loan goes bad . \nBut Fansler said the charter community 's traditional banking partners , such as Bank of America , PNC and M&T Bank , have been tentative . \n`` We 're reaching out to build as many relationships as we can , '' said Fansler , who remained optimistic that a deal can be struck . \n`` There are a lot of ways we can mitigate this , but it 's just more complicated and expensive . '' \nOther ventures have been delayed by the economic uncertainty . \nC sar Ch vez Public Charter Schools for Public Policy had hoped to have a third campus , at the old Bruce School building in Petworth , up and running this fall . \nBryan Patten , chief financial officer , said the original plan involved generating money for the renovation through the sale of tax-exempt bonds . \nIn mid-2007 , he said , `` it was an attractive option , but every time we talked to the bank , the interest rate went up . '' \nEventually , the school secured a conventional construction loan , but it will not be able to occupy Bruce until next fall . \nNationally , the situation is much the same -- schools are n't shut down but delayed , charter operators said . \nMike Piscal , founder of the Inner City Education Foundation in Los Angeles , said last week that its campuses would expand from 13 to 35 over the next eight years . \n`` So far , deals that would be done with 20 percent down now require 30 percent . \nDeals that would take two to three months are now taking five to six months , '' he said . \nThe market meltdown comes at a moment of unusual opportunity for the local charter community . \nLast month , the District government revised its plans for the use of school buildings closed for low enrollment last year . \nIt issued a new request for expressions of interest in the properties exclusively from charter schools . \nAn earlier request had been opened to other private businesses and had limited the number of charter schools that could participate . \nIt 's not clear how the climate will affect interest in the buildings . \nOffers are due by Oct. 27 . \nCharter school officials said they were particularly concerned that some of the new schools that opened this fall with small numbers of students and no track record might have difficulty securing credit for working capital . \nAt least two in Northeast Washington , Thea Bowman Preparatory Academy and Washington Yu Ying , have fallen short of their projected enrollment , which means their quarterly payment due from the District this month will be lower than anticipated . \n`` Downward adjustments can have a dramatic impact on cash flow , '' said Jeremy Williams , finance manager for the Public Charter School Board , adding that he was concerned that the schools would have difficulty borrowing operating capital . \nWashington Yu Ying , which offers a Chinese immersion program for prekindergarten , kindergarten and first-grade students , is about 20 short of its projected enrollment of 150 . \nExecutive Director Mary Shaffner said she had begun the application process for a line of credit and would raise private money . \nThea Bowman , which has attracted 47 of the 100 fifth - and sixth-graders it expected , has laid off three staff members and cut salaries to make its budget . \nPrincipal Mark Cosenza said that the school was at no immediate risk but that he would begin fundraising . \nMore in the D.C.

'' \n`` Local security forces assisted by the army started to attack Latakia on Saturday forcing the port to close . \nToday the port reopened and is working normally , '' a shipping agent source based in Syria told Reuters on Thursday . \n`` Tartous remains open and working normally .

'' \nFeinberg said he was still sorting out how to deal with indirect claims like hotels that lose bookings because tourists think the beaches are covered in oil , or people who see their property values decline but live several blocks away from an oiled beach . \n`` There 's no question that the property value has diminished as a result of the spill . \nThat does n't mean that every property is entitled to compensation , '' he said , adding : `` There 's not enough money in the world to pay everybody who 'd like to have money . '' \nFeinberg , who headed a compensation fund for victims of the September 11 attacks , assured lawmakers the fund would be `` totally independent '' and said BP had agreed to top up the escrow account as needed to meet proper claims . \nThe British energy giant has already disbursed more than $ 130 million in emergency payments to fishermen and others affected by the slick . \nFeinberg said lump sum payments would be offered to claimants once the true extent of the damage is assessed . \n`` It sure would help if the oil would stop , '' he told the committee . \nMeanwhile the Animal Welfare Institute -LRB- AWI -RRB- and other groups sued BP over the turtles ' deaths and asked a federal court to stop the company 's `` controlled burns . '' \n`` It is horrifying that these innocent creatures whose habitat has already been devastated by the oil spill are now being burned alive , '' AWI President Cathy Liss told the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana . \nThe lawsuit filed by AWI , Center for Biological Diversity , Turtle Island Restoration Network and Animal Legal Defense Fund said BP was violating the Endangered Species Act and other laws with their `` controlled burns '' in the Gulf of Mexico . \nThey asked the court for a temporary restraining order to stop all burning activities `` until ... mechanisms are implemented that will prevent any additional sea turtles from being burned alive . '' \nAlso on Wednesday , Obama ordered the development of a long-term plan to `` restore the unique beauty and bounty '' of the Gulf Coast . \nThe Long-Term Gulf Restoration Support Plan aims to `` ensure economic recovery , community planning , science-based restoration of the ecosystem and environment , public health and safety efforts , and support of individuals and businesses who suffered losses due to the spill , '' a White House memo said . \nAn estimated 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day have been gushing out of the ruptured well since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sank on April 22 some 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana . \nEfforts to permanently plug the leak by drilling relief wells continued despite the rough seas which had forced a halt to skimming operations off the coasts of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and Florida . \nTwo containment ships continued to capture the oil at a rate of about 25,000 barrels per day despite seven-foot -LRB- two-meter -RRB- swells . \nBut the rough seas delayed the deployment of a third ship aimed at doubling the containment capacity . \nAnd officials warned that drilling and containment will be suspended for about 14 days if the spill zone is threatened by a more direct storm hit . \nThat could delay the completion of the wells until at least September and would dump an additional 490,000 to 840,000 barrels of extra oil into the Gulf . \nSenior government officials were set to meet with Obama Thursday to discuss whether a new containment system should be installed in the interim . \nThat system would further raise capacity , but would require the current cap to be removed and involve careful manipulation some 5,000 feet -LRB- 1,500 meters -RRB- below the surface .

{"txt": "Gulf oil spill : An industry at war with itself The blowout on the Deepwater Horizon rig undermined Big Oil 's ` safety first ' mantra BP 's report demolishes it Wednesday 8 September 2010 21.39 BST It is not often we are given a very public and highly critical insight into an industry as private as oil . \nThis is a sector that is used to secrecy , and one before which many governments , never mind members of the public , are forced to bend the knee . \nBig Oil is used to waving away questions about the way it operates with the assuring mantra that `` safety always comes first '' , but the blowout on board the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig last April blew away some of the mystique . \nThe report by BP 's investigation team published today takes this demolition job a stage further by itemising a host of human and mechanical failures that it believes were responsible for the accident . \nCritics of BP and that now includes its rig operator Transocean see this as an attempt to spread the blame among its partners , but whoever is responsible for each mistake , no one is questioning the basic narrative : a catalogue of chaos . \nWhat is doubly disturbing about the problems , be they `` human judgments , engineering design , operational implementation '' as the investigating team points out , is that they were produced by the industry 's finest . \nBP is the largest operator in the US Gulf ; Transocean is the biggest rig operator in the world ; and Halliburton , targeted by the report for its `` cement '' work on the stricken well , used to be led by former US vice president Dick Cheney . \nThey are the industry aristocracy . \nOne shudders to imagine what might be happening at less financially secure and worse-managed companies . \nNeil Atkinson , energy industry research director at Datamonitor , said all the companies involved were `` world class '' but in this case `` slipshod '' . \nThe most common private reaction of the oil industry to the Gulf spill was `` there but for the Grace of God go I , '' said Atkinson , who believed it showed an accident like this could happen any day , any place . \nThe BP investigation team makes 25 recommendations covering everything from blowout preventers , well control , emergency systems , cement testing , rig audit and personnel testing . \nThe company said it expected its finding `` to be considered relevant to the oil industry more generally and for some of the recommendations to be widely adopted . '' \nThis will add to growing concerns among environmentalists , trade unions and the wider public that the oil industry desperately needs reining in . \nThey will give muscle to senior political figures such as G nther Oettinger , the European energy commissioner , who has already prosed a ban on some offshore drilling until all the lessons are learned from the Gulf blowout . \nIt also comes at a time when the oil industry is trying to move into more and more environmentally sensitive areas : Greenland and the Arctic region for example as easily accessible reserves run out . \nFor Britain the report arrives just as the Health and Safety Executive has reported an alarming escalation in the number of offshore accidents . \nThe Guardian reported earlier this week that Transocean had come under scrutiny from the HSE after the safety regulator reported allegations of bullying and intimidation on some of its North Sea rigs . \nThe BP report is far from the final word on the Deepwater Horizon with further reports due from more obviously independent bodies such as the US coast guard and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management . \nThere will also be concerns that at a time when the industry should be working closely together to improve safety measures , there are signs of dispute and non-cooperation between the parties . \nTransocean immediately rejected the BP report as `` self-serving '' , while the oil company complained that its investigation team could not complete all of its work because of the `` unavailability of Halliburton cement additives and products '' . \nBP goes on to say that that the team was also `` unable to obtain access for testing of a representative Cameron blow out preventer '' as well as the same safety device off the damaged Deepwater Horizon rig . \nThis is an industry at war with itself . \nThat 's not such a bad thing if it produces higher safety standards , more transparency and a bit more humility . \nA version appeared on p7 of the Main section section of the Guardian on Follow all the top stories of the day on Twitter with the Guardian 's world news team achrisafis : RT News : One of the #Algeria hostages is Irish .

from search and rescue teams and medical aid , to food aid and then longer-term rebuilding of infrastructure . \nThe US is mobilising a huge military and civilian aid effort as President Barack Obama pledged a `` swift , co-ordinated and aggressive '' to save lives . \nHe put the US international development agency -

{"txt": "Flames rise from a gas pipeline attack in the Egyptian Sinai town of El Arish on February 5 , 2011 . \nA pipeline that sends natural gas to Jordan was set on fire in the Egyptian Sinai town of El Arish on Saturday , and the suspected act of sabotage has forced its temporary closing , officials said . \nGhaleb Al Maabreh , head of Jordan 's national electricity company , confirmed the closing . \nHe said at least one week will be needed to fix it and the cost for the repair will be covered by Jordan . \nAl Maabreh said the government will start using alternative sources that will cost it $ 4.2 million daily . \nIt is able to provide itself with energy sources for the coming three weeks , he added . \nUnless the pipe is repaired quickly , it could become a big problem for Jordan , a country already spending heavily in fuel subsidies , a Jordanian senior official said . \nRead more ... February 6th , 2011 11:14 am ET Current events in the middle east have become very clear . \nHere are a few details which will help you understand . \nOPEC is an oil cartel\\/monopoly which is run by 11 heads of state from the middle east . \nAmerican statesmen have declared that the price of oil is inflated because of this monopoly . \nThey think OPEC 's monopoly threatens Americas need for cheap oil . \nThey think if OPEC should be broken up -LRB- Lets say OPEC group A & OPEC group -RRB- then competition between rival OPEC A & B would drive down the price of oil . \nNext you must be aware that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has been set up and funded by Britain 's MI5 since the 1920s . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood were used by the British to revolt against President Nasser during the Suez crisis . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood are calling for revolution throughout the middle east . \nThis equates to Britain and her allies wanting revolution throughout the middle east . \nCouple this with Americans calling for the breakup of OPEC and it becomes clear that the plan by the west is to dismantle this area . \nFor example , if Saudi Arabia exploded into revolution it may split into North Saudi and South Saudi . \nWith all the middle east in revolution the 11 OPEC members could be split into 22 OPEC members . \nBut the 22 will be rivals , form separate groups and create competition in oil sales which will drive down the price . \nHowever the game cant end with a breakdown of OPEC . \nThe resulting cheap oil will also be available to China . \nFor America to control the cheap oil , it will need to keep the area in a state of constant chaos and on the edge of war . \nThis will create the excuse for America to deploy its military and pretend that its in the region to create peace . \nThe exchange for this calculated peace will be for the cheap oil to be directed to America . \nSome will argue that most of the dictators in the middle east are puppets installed by America and that the USA is already in control . \nThis is correct , but only to a certain level . \nMost of the American backed middle east dictators have become +30 year family dynasties . \nThey will follow America to a point . \nBut if the USA wants utter turmoil which can threaten the succession of the family dynasty , the dictators will defy the will of America . \ni.e. for Mubarak it was more important that his son takes power , obeying the USA had become a secondary priority . \nAmerica threw the stone of revolution in the middle east and tried hide its hand . \nThats why they started with claims of support for Mubarak . \nIt was not supposed to look like an American driven revolt . \nBut when Mubarak found a way to cling onto power , the Americans realized their plan may fail . \nHence the Americans started to announce Mubarak must go . \nThere is no confusion in America , only a fear that their plan may not work . \nAmerica hopes ElBaradei will take control of Egypt as he is their man and will follow the instructions needed to help break up OPEC and spread revolt . \nIsraelis will now find that for 60 years they have been sleeping with the American mafia . \nIt was fine for them as America -LRB- once the only super power -RRB- would back Israel in any crime or illegal occupation . \nIsraelis were laughing at the Arabs as the grabbed more and more land with American support . \nBut now America has a plan for middle east rebellion and instability to breakup OPEC . \nThe instability needs to last generations , so the USA can have its military there to ensure the USA gets all the oil it wants . \nWith this agenda , Mubarak and peace between Israel and Egypt is expendable . \nWith turmoil in the middle east both Muslim and Jew will die and suffer . \nIsrael is about to learn that when you sleep with the mafia you are expendable . \nNow some Israelis have a dream of a greater Israel which includes parts of Egypt , Jordan , Syria and Saudi Arabia . \nSome Israeli leaders may see the turmoil as a chance for more military victories and a chance to grab more land . \nThey will sell the idea of conflict on the Israelis as they believe it will be for the countries greater good . \nNevertheless , the price will be paid in Jewish and Muslim blood . \nMubarak has played some extremely difficult cards with brilliance . \nHe knows he has been betrayed by America and is probably buying time to establish better relations with Russia , China and Turkey . \nAll the other Arab dictators have also seen how America may betray them . \nSo do n't be surprised if China or Russia are invited to open naval or air bases in the middle east soon . \nAmerica has taken an enormous gamble which will be paid for by everyone in the middle east . \nMy guess is ; in the long term it will also accelerate the decline of American influence in the area . \nConclusion , Israel better get to the negotiating table quickly and offer something that can be considered reasonable and serious . \nGet as much regional agreement as possible while you still hold the upper hand . \nThe dynamics of the middle east are changing and you ca n't rely on the benefits of American mafia styled politics . \nAmerica can wait for Mubarak to leave in September . \nThe next opportunity for the USA to generate chaos now looks like it will be after he steps down . \nThe next vote will be crooked as always and the dissatisfaction of the people will again be whipped up into anarchy . \nFebruary 6th , 2011 4:45 pm ET p.s. Egyptian people have genuine concerns . \nMost of these concerns are based on the cost of living and limited chances to feed their families . \nThe IMF -LRB- largely run by USA & UK -RRB- instructed Egypt to cut food subsidies or face a reduced credit rating . \nIts called banking poor countries into submission . \nThey new Egyptian people would not be able to afford to eat and then they would blame the government . \nThe IMF was the political tool used to spark this crisis . \nThe the people of Jordan were then inspired by Egyptian protest and also start to protest themselves over their poor living conditions . \nAnd surprise surprise they have their gas cut off . \nAn act intended to increase dissatisfaction in Jordan . \nHow many more dirty tricks will we see in the Anglo American attempt to destabilize the middle east , cause revolt and breakup OPEC . \nPeople of the world from America to Jordan , from Egypt to Israel better start realizing they are all expendable pawns in the game played by our out of control governments -LRB- Goverments who serve the military industrial complex and banks , they dont serve you -RRB- . \nOn a closing note Liberty and human rights are not subjects for governments to meddle with . \nOn the other hand Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on whats for lunch . \nInstead of crowing about democracy in the world , we should be focusing on Liberty . \nThe founding fathers of America said , `` Give me Liberty or Give me death '' . \nThey did not ask for democracy , as democracy can be interpreted in so many different ways -LRB- As we have discovered via wiki leaks -RRB- . \nIf the West 's focus was on human liberty our politicians would be greatly limited in their ability to manipulate the lives of the people they were elected to serve . \nFebruary 7th , 2011 4:18 am ET Good Analysis . \nWe need more about Mahdi coming and Jesus coming to face the anti christ and the armagadon . \nThe MI5 is a British domestic counter-terrorism force . \nThey would have had little role in Egypt of the 1920s . \nIf the British had any role in supporting the creation of the Muslim Brotherhood it may have been their interest in the social institutions they were setting up in British controlled Egypt but , as has been proven many times , this was only one element in their agenda . \nIt is rediculous to suggest that while the British were trying to prevent German infiltration in the 1930s they would be supporting the Brotherhood who were working with the Nazis to defeat the British . \nAlthough doubtless there have always been British Arabists who would do anything to promote the Arab cause even to the detriment of their own nation . \nYour comments are little more than anti-Western conspiracy and propaganda . \nMiriam , you are so sweet and simple in mind . \nThe Egyptians did n't like it . \nSo Britain created a radical group to convince the people anarchy would replace Britain . \nDoes that sound familiar to you . \nBut in your sweet simple world there are no spies or dirty tricks . \nIn fact the thought of a country manipulating information is a wild conspiracy theory . \nDo n't you think its time to grow up . \nThe real world does n't guarantee a Walt Disney happy ever after . \nWhere do you get your facts from ? \nThey are not supported by anything to be found on the internet . \nDo you have a secret library of sources only available to you ? \nI have covered a lot of issues . \nName the ones you would like more information on and I will point you to the sources . \nIn fact you will find them on the web if you try a little harder with your research . \nBut be warned , if you can support facts on this web site , some will try to say its just cut and paste . \nIf you do n't offer sources of information , others will say the sources do n't exist . \nMeanwhile most people just type in blogs that have no thinking behind them at all . \nI love your analysis becuase they align with my thinking about America and her allieds , particularly when it comes to political and economic interest . \nBut they often forget that what goes around comes around . \nI think the solution to these problems confronting humanity is to form a universal government where all humans are giving equal liberty . \nMeaning that the more we tolerate geographical barrier , entry visa , racial distinction , all sorts of political associations etc. the more humanity sinks into these problems . \nThe Arabs were not the only ones trying to negotiate with the Nazis . \n`` As late as 1941 , the Zionist group LEHI , one of whose leaders , Yitzhak Shamir , was later to become a prime minister of Israel , approached the Nazis , using the name of its parent organization , the Irgun -LRB- NMO -RRB- ... -LRB- The proposal stated : -RRB- ` The establishment of the historical Jewish state on a national and totalitarian Pd bound by a treaty with the German Reich would be in the interests of strengthening the future German nation of power in the Near East ... The NMO in Palestine offers to take an active part in the war on Germany 's side ' ... The Nazis rejected this proposal for an alliance because , it is reported , they considered LEHI 's military power ` negligible . ' \nAllan Brownfield in `` The Washington Report on Middle Eastern Affairs '' , July\\/August 1998 . \nFebruary 9th , 2011 11:38 am ET Izma says , `` the solution to these problems confronting humanity is to form a universal government '' A universal government means one leader for all the world . \nThis is in fact a definition for dictatorship . \nBe very careful for what you wish for . \nIn my opinion the real solution is less government , more law which protects human rights and the let people manage their own lives . \nPeople manage their lives better than government . \nWhat governemnt actually is popular and successfull ? \nSad answer : non . \nSo lets drop the global goverment idea which is more or less the meaning behind the story 1984 . \nWhat you fail to mention in your regurgitated anti-Israel propaganda is that the Lehi , a group with no single political , religious or economic ideology whose members ranged from the far-right to the far-left before and after the re-establishment of the Jewish state , was unpopular within the Jewish population and rejected by the Jewish leadership for its terrorist activities . \nMany members had served with the British against the Nazis at the start of WW2 but with the British Mandate anti-immigration policy which left thousands of Jewish refugees fleeing Europe having to return straight back to extermination camps , some became staunchly anti-British and anti-imperialist . \nA wild , and for obvious reasons , unpopular proposal sent to the Nazi party suggested that they could solve their `` problem '' with the presence of Jews in Europe by allowing their emigration to a Jewish state . \nAt the same time , they would continue with their shared aim of defeating the British . \nClaiming that the British established the Brotherhood is as stupid as suggesting that the British created the Lehi , that is , excluding the reactionary contribution . \nBut then again , some of the conspiracies we read here are that stupid . \nThe proposal by Shamir is not a conspiracy theory but a fact and people were so outraged that they elected him PM of Israel . \nThe spin you have tried to put on facts of history is just so much BS . . \nAs we say '' this dog wo n't hunt '' . \nFebruary 11th , 2011 8:38 pm ET Do n't think America is behind this at all ! \nThis was all precipitated by the backwards economic programs in all these Arab nations , run by Monarchs or Totalitarian leaders . \nThe spark that set it off was a Tunisian setting himself on fire over the problems in Tunisia , and Egyptians responded that they were all suffering from the same thing . \nAll over the Arab\\/Muslim world , including Iran , the problems are the same . \nThe rest of the world is progressing faster and these people were being left behind , largely because of the ineptitude of their leadership . \nRevolution is the hardest thing until it is done , now the hardest thing will be establishing a new order , one that actually fulfills some of the people 's aspirations . \nThere is no reason Egypt 's people ca n't be productive or modern as anywhere , but it will take time to achieve that and in the meantime they have to worry about feeding themselves . \nAll they have done is gotten rid of a bad leader , that does n't mean they do n't have real problems that need to be addressed before things get better . \nAre n't the people in Egypt going through what America did in gaining it 's independence ? \nUltimately political power lies with the people , if the Army wo n't fire on them , then their will is more likely to come into being . \nThey need a full overhaul of their government , their constitution and their policies . \nMany regions of the world which were once colonized have eventually emerged with a hope to rule themselves . \nWe have many examples from Africa and South America . \nUnfortunately all newly liberated countries soon wake up to reality . \nTheir history included occupation by a foreign military . \nThis is quickly replaced with stealth colonialism controlled by banks . \nNo country is free through the word `` democracy '' . \nFreedom is built via fair trade and resultant financial stability . \nFreedom also requires laws to protect human rights . \nThe post colonial powers and America have always spoken with hypocrisy . \nThey claim they want a democratic and prosperous world and then use their established power to ensure the people of developing regions can not compete within a fair market place . \nBesides if Egypt freely and democratically elects a government which calls American & Israeli corruption to account , we know western media will declare Egypt to be a hostile Islamic state . \nThis in itself will be hypocritical , because in America its okay to have a Jewish state , but its wrong to have an Islamic state . \nEgypt is far from being free , but its suppressors are not all within Egypt . \nOne good thing I noticed is that all Egyptians interviewed on the street are aware of American hypocrisy . \nAs one said so well after Obama 's latest speech , `` We started this revolution without the help of America and we will end it without the help of America '' . \nNeedless to say America now busily does all it can to ensure Egyptians choose a leader wanted by the Whitehouse . \nNow if we really care about democracy , we should do everything possible to ensure that the Egyptians choose who they want and the world community supports their choice without economically pressuring them into a leadership the west prefers . \nWho called it a conspiracy theory ? \nYou are correct it is a fact but over exaggerate it 's significance . \nNot only did almost all the Jewish leadership reject the proposal including other Lehi members , the Nazis rejected it primarily because it contradicted their objectives in collaborating with Arab leaders . \nWRT Shamir 's election to PM , as is common in virtually all societies , those who fought for independence are often elected as political leaders although in Israel 's case , they were given many years to prove that their militant activities had been well and truly abandoned . \nThis is was you wrote : `` some of the conspiracies we read here are that stupid . '' \nAt least get right it right . \nEnough already with your BS ! \nConspiracy in relation to the Brotherhood being created by MI5 . \nYou do n't need to twist my words . \nyou are the BSter , you have no idea about facts , you lie , falsify history and support the jew hating antisemite john cut-and-paste A February 20th , 2011 10:56 am ET Proud Zionist has escaped from his nurses again . \nIf any one has seen Proud Zionist , please be kind enough to let Herzog Hospital know where he is . \nWith thanks to all the tireless staff who take care of him . \nWhere can I read more posts about this ? \nJanuary 22nd , 2012 11:25 am ET Hi , satisfyingly area , i muse on hither something correspond to to this chair but i do n't procure anytime second , but seriously it 's utter careful Comments are moderated by CNN , in accordance with the CNN Comment Policy , and may not appear on this blog until they have been reviewed and deemed appropriate for posting . \nAlso , due to the volume of comments we receive , not all comments will be posted . \nWelcome to the Inside the Middle East blog where CNN 's journalists post news , views and video from across the region . \nThis is also a place where you can start the discussion so please keep your comments coming . \nWe highlight not only current news stories but also anecdotes and issues that do n't always make the top of the headlines . \nInside the Middle East airs the first week of every month on the following days and times : ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/egyptianprotest_cnn/rsd/EgyptianProtest_cnn__2011-02-06__170.rsd.txt"}
{"txt": "We had a contingency plan for Louisiana spill , and it 's working , BP chief tells angry senators But all three oil firms try to blame each other 's errors ; hearing acknowledges regulatory oversight failed US national guard helicopters drop sandbags near Grand Isle , Louisiana , in an effort to contain oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill . \nPhotograph : Ted Jackson\\/AP BP insisted last night that its contingency plan had worked , despite coming under fire in Congress for minimizing the risks of offshore drilling and trying to shirk blame for the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico . \nWith an estimated 4m gallons of oil polluting the gulf from the ruptured well , Lamar McKay , the chief executive of BP America , said the company had adequately anticipated the potential scale of any spill and that its clean-up operation had gone according to plan . \n`` We had a very specific plan , '' he told the Senate . \n`` It has actually worked . '' \nHe added : `` We 're going to continue to do everything we can to minimize the risk of a massivelymphoblastic spill . '' \nBP 's defense came at the end of a testy day of hearings before two committees which saw the three oil titans connected to the disaster repeatedly accused of trying to slough off their financial and legal obligations . \nExecutives of BP America , which owned the well , Transocean , which owned the sunken Deepwater Horizon rig , and Halliburton , which cemented the wall , were repeatedly taken to task by senators for failing to put in place adquate safety regimes . \nBP was also pressed for specifics on its commitment to honor all `` legitimate claims '' for damages from the spill . \nThe senators ' anger grew as all three admitted they could offer no guarantees against another calamity in the Gulf . \n`` There is just nothing there underneath your statements , '' said Barbara Boxer , the chair of the Senate environment and public works committee . \n`` If you look at what 's happening it is very very disturbing . '' \nBut other senators acknowledged a failure of regulatory oversight . \n`` We dropped the ball here , '' said Max Baucus , a Democrat from Montana . \nThe day got underway with BP America 's chief executive , Lamar McKay , pointing to Transocean , the operator of the rig , and pinning a failed blowout preventer , a 450 tonne set of valves now lying on the ocean floor . \n`` We have a blowout preventer that did n't work , '' McKay said . \nTransocean 's Steven Newman fired straight back . \n`` Offshore oil and gas production projects begin and end with the operator , in this case BP , '' he said . \nIts health , safety and environment officer , Tim Probert , started off by warning against a premature rush to judgment then took his turn at assigning blame . \nLike Newman , he told the hearing that Halliburton had carried out its work according to BP 's specifications . \nYesterday 's hearings on Capitol Hill and in Kenner , Louisiana mark the first official efforts to unravel the causes of spill , and prevent future disasters . \nBP and the others were put on notice the spill could well change the future of offshore drilling . \n`` If you ca n't convince people that you can operate safely , not only will BP not be out there , but Transocean wo n't be out there to drill the rigs , and Halliburton wo n't be out there cementing , '' said Lisa Murkowski , a Republican from Alaska who supports drilling . \nThe first changes were set in motion yesterday , with the Obama administration proposing reform in the policing of offshore drilling following repeated charges that regulators were too cosy with oil companies . \nA proposed overhaul of the mineral management service would put a firewall between officials approving projects and those responsible for making operations meet safety and environmental standards . \nThe move comes amid repeated charges from senators yesterday that the mineral management service was `` too cozy '' . \nThe hearing was told the BP and other companies routinely won exemptions from environmental review of offshore projects , a waiver process McKay described as `` just the industry standard '' . \nMeanwhile , the long-awaited energy and climate bill due for release today was also tweaked in response to heightened concerns about drilling . \nThe bill will still expand offshore drilling , but environmental groups said they were assured that states would be able to veto projects within 75 miles of their shores . \nAs the hearings played out on Capitol Hill , the Louisiana national guard deployed troops in Blackhawk helicopters to drop sandbags along the shoreline . \nMuch evidence at the two hearings yesterday was technical , about various protective devices that should if functioning properly prevent catastrophe . \nOne key detail could be the cement casing of the well . \nHalliburton noted the well had been left without a cap or blowout preventer for five months before the explosion . \nBP also faced tough questions about whether it was too complacent about the risks of deepwater drilling , given more than a dozen accidents in the last five years involving failed blow out preventers . \nBP was also pressed repeatedly to spell out its commitment to pay all `` legitimate '' claims of compensation for the spill . \nSenators also accused the company of cutting corners in its disaster planning by failing to have a containment dome and stocks of dispersants were not on standby . \n`` What I see here is a company flailing around trying to deal with a worst-case scenario , '' Robert Menendez , a New Jersey senator , told BP . \nThe three companies were also forced to admit under questioning that they were conducting no research into how to deal with deep water spills . \nBP , in particular , was singled out over fatal accidents in Texas , as well as safety violations in Alaska . \nA version appeared on p18 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 09.26 BST on Wednesday 12 May 2010 The latest news and comment from our team of reporters , writers and editors in the US Auto update every minute On | Off moorehn : Huh ! \nRT @BrianSozzi : Within food , white bread had one of the strongest price increases in December .

Addressing a meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York by video link from Geneva , she also cautioned against complacency : `` Flu viruses are very unpredictable , very deceptive ...

{"txt": "\\* Cuban coast a major breeding ground for marine species \\* Concern that Gulf current could carry oil to Cuba \\* Cuba open to cooperation with U.S. against spill HAVANA , May 28 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Red flags went up on beaches in western Cuban this week , closing them briefly to swimmers amid rumors that the BP oil spill in the U.S. part of the Gulf of Mexico was forcing sharks into Cuban waters . \nThe government , through state-run press , quickly denounced the rumors as false and the beaches were reopened , but the incident reflected fears that the massive spill will reach Cuba and wreak havoc on an island still relatively untouched by modernity 's environmental ills . \n`` Cuba , like all the countries in this area , is worried about the situation in the Gulf , '' said Osmani Borrego Fernandez , a director at the Guanahacabibes National Park at Cuba 's western tip . \n \n`` It 's a very sensitive situation , '' he said unnamed . \nA trip along Cuba 's coastline is like a trip back in time where vast stretches of palm-fringed beaches sit undeveloped and sea life abounds in the crystalline waters . \nWhile rampant development and overfishing have damaged coastlines and depleted seas around the world , communist-led Cuba has been largely preserved by its slow economic pace . \nAs a result , scientists and environmentalists view Cuban waters as a place where they can see how the world 's oceans were decades ago . \n`` Many areas along the coast , and thousands of small keys , are in rural areas or are remote and have simply been left alone , '' said Dan Whittle , senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund . \n`` Ernest Hemingway set up a fish camp on Cayo Paraiso -LRB- about 90 miles -LRB- 145 km -RRB- west of Havana -RRB- in the 1940s and the area has not really changed since then . \nIf he were still alive , he 'd still recognize it today , '' he said of the U.S. writer who lived in Cuba for two decades . \nCuba 's northwest coast is considered most in danger from the oil . \nIt is there that coral reefs , seagrass beds and mangroves provide major breeding grounds for many fish and sea creatures , including endangered migratory species like sea turtles , sharks and manatees , Whittle said . \nAll that is at stake if the BP oil finds its way to Cuba . \nIt could also damage Cuba 's tourism industry , which is centered on beaches and to a lesser degree eco-tourism . \nTourism brought in more than $ 2 billion to Cuba last year , or about 20 percent of Cuban 's foreign exchange income . \nThe good news for Cuba is that the spill is still centered about 300 miles -LRB- 483 km -RRB- northwest of the island and BP may finally be gaining control over the massive leak . \nOfficials for the oil giant said on Friday their so-called `` top kill '' solution of plugging the gusher by pumping in `` drilling mud '' was showing signs of success . \nBut even if that happens soon , Cuban officials are concerned that the oil already in the water could be swept south by gulf currents . \nCuba is separated from the Florida Keys by just 90 miles -LRB- 145 km -RRB- of water and despite their disparate political histories , the United States and Cuba are inextricably linked ecologically . \nAnother rumor that supposedly contributed to the Cuban beach closures this week was that lionfish , which have venomous spikes and have invaded Cuban waters in recent years from Florida , were poisoning swimmers . \nThe government said that rumor also was false . \nThe United States and Cuba have been at odds since Fidel Castro took power in a 1959 revolution , but they held talks last week about the oil slick , officials said . \nCuba expert Wayne Smith at the Center for International Policy think tank in Washington said he met with Cuban authorities this week in Havana and that they are `` fully open '' to cooperation with the Americans to stop the oil . \nStanding in the way is the longstanding U.S. trade embargo against Cuba , which prevents the use of much U.S. technology in Cuba . \nAt a conference this week in Washington , oil experts and environmentalists said it was time to allow cooperation with Cuba in oil safety practices . \n`` We are not talking about a transfer of technology . \nAll we are asking is that , if there is an accident , the Cubans can pick up the phone and call American experts who can bring resources within 24 hours , '' said oil expert Jorge Pinon . \nThe issue is becoming a bigger one as Spanish oil giant Repsol -LRB- REP. MC -RRB- REP. N prepares to drill for oil off Cuba 's ecologically rich northwest coast perhaps later this year . \nIt has contracted for use of an Italian-owned drilling rig now being completed in China . \nWhile the spill is a disaster , it might have one positive result , Smith said . \n`` It actually could help improve -LRB- U.S.-Cuba -RRB- relations if we cooperate in the right way and we have the right attitude , '' he said .

{"txt": "Illustrating a news story with photographs can be much more challenging than simply deploying a talented photographer on site . \nSometimes initially identifying where and how the best pictures will be made is a daunting task , let alone getting a photographer there , especially when the subject is spread over thousands of square miles of sea and ground zero is miles offshore and a mile below the surface . \nNo news event in recent memory has been more challenging to cover than the Gulf Coast oil spill due to the nature and dynamics of the story . \nWhen it was first determined that the BP well was gushing oil , our coverage efforts for the next several months were focused on oil seen on the surface , oil reaching the hundreds of miles of shoreline , impact on local fishermen and residents and wildlife and clean up efforts . \nWhile several talented Reuters photographers documented these aspects of the story , my co-workers and I on the Washington picture desk , with help from our colleagues in Singapore , went 5,000 feet below the surface to illustrate the actual leak and containment , all from the comfort of our desk chair . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nPressured by Congress , on May 21 , a month after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig caught on fire ; BP began showing on their website live video feeds of oil gushing from a riser on the seabed floor . \nDuring the following 4 months while efforts to contain and kill the well were underway , live video feeds could be viewed from up to 16 remotely operated vehicles -LRB- ROVs -RRB- , tethered to and managed by up to 8 surface boats . \nThe ROVs carried out all the tasks necessary for containment , giving the viewer of the live feed a front row seat to perhaps one of the largest engineering undertakings ever performed at such depths . \nAs the story as a whole involved so many angles , some of the key turning points to illustrate centered on the progress seen only from the video feeds , from the first view of the leak at the source , to the capping of the well and the first time no oil could be seen gushing from the mechanism . \nCovering the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster as a still photographer for Reuters has brought unique challenges . \nAlthough the volume of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico is huge , relatively small patches of oil have landed along coastal Louisiana . \nIt 's like a monster who hides most of the time and lashes out quickly , withholding its full strength . \nBut it has been important to show that oil is in fact having an ecological impact here , and to find areas with visible proof . \nOn Thursday May 20 , I accompanied a Reuters TV crew , correspondent Mathew Bigg and Maura Wood of the National Wildlife Federation on a boat , looking for heavy concentrations of oil in an area at the very southern tip of Louisiana . \nWe headed for an area which had just begun being inundated with oil from the Deepwater Horizon leak . \nAfter hours of searching , a broken propeller , and an unexpected lunch aboard a work barge , we had found the spot . \nAs Wood prepared to take a sample of the water to check its toxicity , I suited up in chest waders and slowly got into the murky water , one camera and lens stuffed into my waiters . \nManeuvering in the soft lagoon floor was tricky ; I sank down as I tried to walk and was concerned I might loose my balance and get myself and camera wet . \nSo I held onto the drifting boat long enough to get into position , cautiously letting go so I could have both hands free to shoot . \nWood leaned over to get samples and I was able to shoot it from from the perspective of the oily water . \nIt was shortly after midnight on March 24 , 1989 that the Exxon Valdez hit Bligh Reef in Prince Edward Sound and began leaking millions of gallons of North Slope crude oil . \nI was sound asleep in Toronto , Canada when that happened . \nReuters was still taking a feed of pictures from UPI -LRB- United Press International -RRB- from the United States . \nBut I remember hearing the news that morning and packing my gear -LRB- which at that time was film , powder chemicals , portable darkroom , 16S color transmitter and of course . . \nsome cold weather clothing -RRB- . \nI sat in Toronto as the politics of the news business played out in Washington between Reuters and UPI . \nFinally , it was decided that we would both cover the story . \nSo , David Ake , a UPI staffer from Denver , and I made our way there . \nI remember landing in Anchorage , Alaska , and hauling my gear into a rental car at midnight , then driving six hours to Valdez in the dead of night . \nAbout 4 hours into the drive I was held up by a few hundred caribou , who decided to cross the two lane highway , they were just mingling so I still have vivid memories of being in the middle of nowhere honking my horn to help speed up the process . \nI rolled into Valdez at first light and it didn t take long to realize that most of the town s people did not want the media there . \nThe few media that had found rooms at the only hotel in town were all having to checkout as rumor had it that Exxon had bought the hotel . \nWith help from our desk in Washington and the chamber of commerce in Valdez I found a place to stay at the home of the local taxidermist . \nSince joining Reuters in Singapore in 2001 , Corinne has worked as a picture editor on the Asia desk and as an Editor-in-Charge on the global desk . \nIn her current role , Corinne is a member of the online desk in Toronto and is responsible for maintaining the visual elements of www.reuters.com . \nYou can follow Reuters tweets on @reuterspictures ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-09-20__1078.rsd.txt.sent-fake"}

'' \nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also appeared at Monday 's hearing , the first time senators were able to question officials about the response to the 20 April disaster . \nTarballs of oil are said to be more manageable She said the government was monitoring the loop current very closely and treating it as if it were a coastline . \n`` In other words ... if we were to see that the oil really was beginning to move toward the loop current we would begin doing some things in the way of dispersant and booming ... as if the loop current itself were a piece of the coast , '' she said . \nSenator Joseph Lieberman , who chairs the committee , said at the hearing that the government should not allow any new deep water wells to get permits or be drilled until the industry could prove it could prevent another failure of drilling equipment in deep waters or contain oil spills more effectively . \nBP America 's president , Lamar McKay , returned to the Senate for the hearing , having already faced questions along with other oil industry executives last week . \nI think we ought to be cautious in terms of defining what plumes are out there and how they 're behaving Scientists said on Sunday they had found vast underwater plumes of oil , one 10 miles long and a mile wide , lending weight to the fears of those who believe the actual spill could be many times greater than the estimate of 5,000 barrels daily . \nBut Mr McKay told senators : `` I think we ought to be cautious in terms of defining what plumes are out there and how they 're behaving . '' \nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cast doubt on the plume reports , saying no definitive conclusions had been reached because the findings were unverified . \nBP also said on Monday it had received 15,000 claims for compensation , and had already paid out on 2,500 claims . \nExperts warn that BP 's total liability for the spill could run into billions of dollars .

'' \nAbdel Hafiz Ghoga , deputy chairman of Libya 's National Transitional Council , the country 's opposition body , said Wednesday night that international delegates had agreed to make the funds available . \nLibyan rebels plea to NATO Al-Obeidy : ` Please do not forget me ' Ghoga said more than $ 100 billion in regime funds would be unfrozen and made available to the opposition , though he did not say which country or countries would release the funds , or when . \nHe also said rebels requested that NATO intensify its airstrikes and protection of the civilian population . \nThe funding decision came amid a grim assessment of the humanitarian fallout from the Libyan conflict and reports of mounting civilian casualties . \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the delegates that in a worst-case scenario , as many as 3.6 million strife-affected people could eventually require help , and that the money to provide that help has been slow in coming . \nSo far the United Nations has seen only 39 % of the $ 310 million it requested in emergency funding , `` clearly insufficient given the prospective need , '' Ban said . \n`` It is critical that the international community act in concert , that we speak with one voice , and that we continue to work in common cause on behalf of the Libyan people , '' he said . \nThe international delegates were meeting with Libyan opposition leaders in an attempt to work out a peaceful end to the deadly impasse in the North African nation . \nDespite a NATO-led aerial campaign and rebels fighting on the ground , leader Moammar Gadhafi has shown no signs of acquiescing . \nAmong the high-profile attendees in Doha is Gadhafi 's former intelligence chief and foreign minister , Moussa Koussa , who fled to Britain last month . \nGhoga said Koussa was not invited to any of the meetings , however . \n`` Nobody from the National Transitional Council even considered meeting up with him , '' Ghoga said . \n`` It is our belief that Moussa Koussa was seeking to get residency in Doha , or future residency . '' \nRebel spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah had said the opposition was open to meeting with Koussa if he first made clear , in writing , what he has to offer . \nThe Libyan Contact Group was formed after a London conference on Libya last month . \nThe first meeting in Doha comes as civilian casualties continued to mount . \nThe besieged western city of Misrata has been especially vulnerable . \nGadhafi 's tanks have been pounding the city , where several more people were killed Wednesday , Abdulmolah said . \nTuesday , a doctor told CNN , at least 10 people were killed and 30 were wounded . \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday that Gadhafi 's forces have reportedly destroyed crucial food supply warehouses in Misrata and cut off water and power to the city `` in an apparent attempt to starve -LRB- residents -RRB- into submission .

Security Council resolution that calls for `` all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack . '' \nLibyan National Transitional Council member Ali Issawi said the rebels should be supported with military supplies . \nHe said the Libyan people ought to have the right to defend themselves . \nGhoga said the opposition has submitted a wish list of military equipment to Qatar and France . \nHe said the list was compiled by rebel military leaders , but he did n't know exactly what was being requested . \n`` I do n't think there 's going to be a problem in getting military equipment in , '' Ghoga said . \nQatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani , a co-chair of Wednesday 's meeting , said the opposition 's international allies will consider the needs . \n`` Of course we will look at it and make things available for the Libyan people to defend themselves , '' he said . \nLibyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with Milan anti-tank warheads , but he did not say when . \nThere was no immediate response from the Qatari government . \nA week ago , a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with Milan anti-tank missiles , which they did n't have before . \nFighters said they obtained the missiles from the transitional government in Benghazi but did n't know where they came from . \nMBDA , the multinational missile manufacturer that makes the Milan missile , says it is in service in 43 countries around the world . \nIt does not list those countries , but the military analysis site GlobalSecurity.org says the Milan missiles are used by the Qatari armed forces . \n`` The message to Gadhafi is clear , '' the Qatari prime minister said . \n`` He should use his head and those who are around him should advise him that it is in the interest of Libya , and if he is interested in Libya , then he should relinquish power and leave the Libyan people to decide their own destiny .

{"txt": "The catastrophic blowout at Macondo has sliced 40 percent off BP 's market capitalization , and led analysts to speculate about lasting reductions in deepwater drilling and the resulting impact on both long-term oil supply and the fate of climate change legislation . \nThe underlying fear is that Macondo is the oil industry 's Three Mile Island , an accident that turned public opinion against nuclear power for three decades . \nInvestors are right to fear the long-term impact on the company . \nThe catastrophic blowout at Macondo has sliced 40 percent off BP 's market capitalization . \n`` All options are on the table in response to the spill , '' Barack Obama said in a statement . \nBP however faces a very changed operating environment in future . \nDeepwater and ultra-deepwater petroleum wells are just one of a suite of advanced technologies energy producers have been using to extend the peak in conventional oil production . \nIn its 2008 World Energy Outlook , the International Energy Agency -LRB- IEA -RRB- estimated worldwide deepwater and ultra-deepwater reserves at 200 billion barrels . \nEven complete loss of deepwater and ultra-deepwater oil production would have only a marginal impact on total energy supply in the decades to come . \nIn any event , it seems unlikely deepwater exploration and production will be abandoned . \nMost policymakers recognize there is no practical alternative . \nLukewarm public support for climate change legislation shows how little appetite there is for measures significantly increasing the cost of fossil fuels or forcing reductions in energy consumption . \nThe industry actually has a good track record of operating in extremely challenging environments at huge depths and under massive pressures with few accidents . \nOne reason Macondo has stirred such intense passions is because it is so unusual . \nThe public , regulators and the industry itself have become used to the miracle of pulling oil up from deep below the surface without any real understanding of the engineering challenges involved . \nIt has bred complacency . \nDeepwater drilling will continue , probably under a tougher permitting and inspection regime , with additional fail-safe and disaster-recovery systems , adding to the industry 's costs . \nBut higher safety and compliance costs will not materially affect oil prices going forward . \nExtra compliance might add $ 2-3 to the price of a barrel of deepwater oil , but this is inconsequential compared with the vast expense of conducting seismic surveys under miles of seawater , mud and salt ; rig hire ; and the exploration risks of drilling dry wells . \nAnyway , oil prices are set at the margin by the highest-cost form of production , and deepwater and ultra-deepwater are not the marginal source of supply . \nOther technologies such as tar sands , shale oil , and in the medium-term gas-to-liquids -LRB- GTL -RRB- and coal-to-liquids -LRB- CTL -RRB- are all more expensive and will set prices , not deepwater . \nIf it does happen , slower development of deepwater resources would have its biggest impact in the three-six year timeframe , when other technologies are still relatively immature and unable to fill the gap . \nFor the moment , however , oil resources look comfortable in the medium term . \nThe banking crisis and worldwide recession in 2007-09 have shifted the global economy onto a lower and slower growth trajectory , freeing up energy resources and improving the medium-term supply-demand outlook . \nMacondo would have had an enormous impact if it had occurred in H1 2008 . \nIn the current environment , with spare capacity , the industry can absorb the potential loss of supply more easily . \nBILL STILL ON ROAD TO NOWHERE In the near term , Macondo complicates the passage of climate change legislation pending before the U.S. Senate . \nBut the impact should not be exaggerated . \nThe bill 's prospects were already poor and it has been heavily watered down . \nThe emerging deal would have seen the Obama administration and congressional Democrats open up more offshore areas to drilling in exchange for at least some Republican and energy industry support for the modified cap-and-trade provisions set out in Senator John Kerry 's re-named American Power Act . \nThat deal looks an increasingly hard sell , one reason President Barack Obama and senior officials are furious with BP . \nEven before the spill , however , it was far from clear the drilling-for-climate deal would secure the necessary 60 votes in the Senate to move forward . \n-LRB- 1 -RRB- Despite revisions to cap-and-trade , delaying its introduction for manufacturers and promising greater offshore acreage , there has been no lessening of hostility from Senate Republicans . \nThe only Republican to support the compromise initially , South Carolina 's Senator Lindsey Graham , had already dropped his sponsorship under pressure from the party leadership and conservative activists . \n-LRB- 2 -RRB- Coastal Democrats were more or less united in their hostility to more offshore drilling well before Macondo . \nTen coastal-state Democratic senators wrote to Kerry in March to oppose putting drilling into the climate and energy bill . \nThey included Bill Nelson -LRB- Florida -RRB- , Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg -LRB- New Jersey -RRB- , Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed -LRB- Rhode Island -RRB- , Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin -LRB- Maryland -RRB- , Ted Kaufman -LRB- Delaware -RRB- , and Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley -LRB- Oregon -RRB- . \n`` While technological advances have attempted to lower the environmental and economic risks of drilling , experience has shown that no technology is foolproof ... Far from being a thing of the past , spills occur with alarming frequency '' , they wrote , with what now seems like horrible prescience . \nWith industrial and coal-state Democrats opposed to raising the burden on manufacturers and coal-producers , coastal Democrats opposed to drilling , and Republicans leery of a potentially unpopular compromise , the climate bill has a mountain to climb , and is running out of time before the mid-term elections . \nUNLUCKY BP SET FOR BIG CHANGE While Macondo will not have much impact on the wider industry , the effect on BP itself could be far more severe . \nSince the problems with Exxon Valdez -LRB- 1989 -RRB- and Brent Spar -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , BP 's rivals Exxon and Shell have largely avoided major accidents . \nBoth were searing experiences , prompting an overhaul of internal controls and safety culture . \nIn contrast , BP 's North American operations have been plagued by a string of accidents and scandals -- including the Texas City refinery explosion -LRB- which killed 15 and injured 170 others in 2005 -RRB- ; the sinking of the celebrated Thunder Horse platform -LRB- 2005 -RRB- ; and leaks and corrosion on its Alaskan pipeline network . \n-LRB- 2006 -RRB- BP pleaded guilty to felony charges in the Texas City case , and was sentenced to $ 50 million fine and three-years probation . \nAs BP American Chairman Bob Malone accepted at the time `` If our approach to process safety and risk management had been more disciplined and comprehensive , this tragedy could have been prevented '' . \nBP also received a fine and probation for Alaska . \nThe company has also paid a civil monetary penalty of $ 303 million for attempting to manipulate the propane market -LRB- 2004 -RRB- . \nThe settlement beguilingly concluded `` all criminal investigations of BP America on matters related to propane , gasoline , crude oil and other commodity trading '' , implying the CFTC was looking at other issues as well . \nThe incidents may or may not reflect shortcomings in management and culture . \nMaybe the company has just been unlucky . \nBut the number of them in quick succession is beginning to look disturbing . \nRightly or wrongly , BP North America is being singled out by U.S. officials as a problematic part of the industry . \nDeepwater drilling will undoubtedly resume , under a tougher inspection regime . \nBut BP may cede ground to its less accident-prone peers and will come under fierce pressure to change its operating and management practices . \nIt is that fear markets are reflecting with the collapse in the share price . \nThe direct costs of the clean up are only one of the company 's problems . \nBP 's number one priority now is to make sure that the next time a well blows , it belongs to someone else . \nThere are similarities as well as differences between Deepwater Horizon and Three Mile Island . \nThe similarities involve the powers that be lying after the fact to downplay the extent of their respective disasters and the enormity of ensuing long-term effects , which would lead one to conclude that similarly casual -LRB- when it comes to the lives of others -RRB- individuals are in charge of both situations at corporate and government levels . \nThe difference is that the noxiousness of the escaping carcinogens from Three Mile Island and the inevitability of more such incidents led correctly to a moratorium on nuclear power plants in the United States , whereas in the case of Deepwater Horizon all that is really necessary once the incredible mess has been cleared up is that attainable safety standards and procedures are never again bypassed . \nIn both cases , it is unlikely that those responsible will ever remunerate in full those whom they 've harmed because a -RRB- the culpable executives are stingy , unprincipled scoundrels who tend to litigate rather than act decently ; and b -RRB- because in the case of Three Mile Island , the damage will continue for more than a million years , and is thus difficult to fully assess . \nNot so in BP 's case . \nOr rather , not necessarily so -- a lot here depends on BP . \nTOTAL MEDIA BLACKOUT ON GULF OIL SPILL and FAA Closes Airspace over the Gulf Well , obviously the journalists fear for their jobs too ! \nBecause otherwise they 'd write the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth ! \nInstead of which , the mainstream media continues to downplay the size of this catastrophe and assume that the general public are gullible idiots . \nThis is now several steps too far but never fear , the Truth always outs in the end and heads will roll ! \nHOW much oil is under the Gulf ? \nNo , it 's not Three Mile Island . \nIt 's Chernobyl -- considering the scale of environmental catastrophe . \nJust remember Reuters is the company that once had a writer refeer to OPAC a proven funder of terriost , as a CLUB . \nSaudi costs for producing oil are the lowest in the world : according to Ali Al-Naimi , -LRB- Saudi oil minister -RRB- the cost to produce one barrel is less than $ 2 . \n-LRB- a direct quote -RRB- Saudi Arabia reportedly -LRB- ?? -RRB- needs to sell oil for at least $ 55 dollars a barrel to cover the cost of running the country . \nFossil fuels finance 75 percent of the country 's entire domestic spending budget . \nFor the above references click article -LRB- Bottom pg 2 , top pg 3 -RRB- Question : does this include the hundreds of Millions , even Billions of dollars dispersed yearly to the Thousands of Saudi princes to finance their Preposterous , Extravert lifestyles ??? Not to mention the Millions -LRB- Billions ?? -RRB- of dollars of extortion paid to terrorist organizations . \nWhere did You think all that money was coming from ? \nwe 've had discussions up the ying yang . \nwhat we need Now is a LEADER . \nthere is an old saying , `` if you ca n't lead , get behind me and push '' if there R a thousan boats out there get two thousand . \nif there are a thousand people on the beaches get five thousand . \nif the president thinks he 's too bright to get his feet wet and his hands dirty then get the Vice president out there . \nGet Someone OUT in FRONT of this mess and MAKE something happen , Who cares !!! My boyfriend thinks the same with me . \nHe - is eight years older than me , lol . \nMaybe you wanna check out or - tell your friends Are you kidding me John ? \nThis article makes no sense . \n3MI was a disaster to the industry because it was a disaster , and this is no different . \nThis is n't about hydrocarbon needs or reserves just as well as 3MI not being about us running out of plutonium . \nThe disaster at hand is just that . \nFor decades to come , that region will be polluted , and the economics of tourism and fisheries will be in turmoil . \nYou do realize that there is a human scale to all of this rather than just oil economics right ? \nLook past the need to write a sympathetic fluff piece and get to the real meat an potatoes thank you . \nI never thought I 'd say it but I do believe Reuters has lost its objectivity . \nYou should be ashamed of yourselves , or else you should sell off your BP portfolio before it is too late . \nAs well , this disaster will leave a lasting opinion , fear , and hate of the oil industry just as 3MI did to the nuclear industry . \nDo n't kid yourself , because it has already happened . \nOne of these days you journalists are going to wake up and realize the proles have finally awakened from their ignorance and the propaganda no longer works . \nFrom the looks of these responses , it 's already happening . \nJust more London based Reuters spewing complete and utter BS ! \nThis thing is not even remotely contained and this nonsensical moron is trying to draw parallels . \nGive me an Fing break - complete tripe - you guys would n't have made believable stories for Pravda ! \nIn contrast , BP s North American operations have been plagued by a string of accidents and scandals including -LRB- 1 -RRB- the Texas City refinery explosion -LRB- which killed 15 and injured 170 others in 2005 -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the sinking of the celebrated Thunder Horse platform -LRB- 2005 -RRB- ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- leaks and corrosion on its Alaskan pipeline network . \n3 strikes and still not out ? \nHow was BP allowed to undertake such a high-risk project in the first place with this kind of track record ? \nWho 's getting rich behind this ? \nPosted by doctorjay317 | Report as abusive I agree with the article . \nPeople were angry about 3MI enough to fight new nuclear plants because there are alternatives . \nPeople are angry at BP , but not enough to quit using oil products . \nThe industry wo n't be affected in the long term . \nPeople who were relatively casual about Three Mile Island are now looking at the BP fiasco , seeing the same thing all over again only with less radioactivity . \nA certain Jarvis Cocker song comes to mind . \nYou know the one . \nThunderhorse is a joint Exxon BP venture and it did n't sink it listed badly and is in production today . \nReuters get your facts right what about reminding the public of Ixtoc 1 flowing from Mexico for almost 10 months !! Mexico claimed sovereign immunity for damages from the US !!!! That leak soiled 162 miles of US beaches ! \nThis is n't Three Mile Island , it 's worse ! \n3MI did not result in one confirmed human death , while the Deepwater explosion has already claimed 11 lives . \nIt 's a shame the corresponding public opinion does n't have a modicrum of discernment . \nBP is going to pay over $ 50 billion when this all said and done . \nWe just launched a Facebook competitor at story+burn.com Of course , the BP disaster is not like Three Mile Island . \nThree Mile Island accident did not kill anyone ; the BP accident killed eleven people . \nThree Mile Island did not harm anyone in any way . \nRadiation release was so small in the Three Mile Island accident that one gets more radiation dose from flying across the country in a jet domestic flight . \nWho knows today what the human adverse effects will be from the BP disaster , but it will be very large indeed . \nThe environmental effects could be extreme in the BP disaster , not so for the Three Mile Island accident . \nThe Three Mile Island accident was an economic disaster to the tune of $ 6 Billion dollars in today 's dollars -LRB- replacement cost for a plant today -RRB- . \nThe BP disaster will be considerably more than this and bring down a huge company with a lot of layoffs of mostly very good people . \nThe utility owning the nuclear plant survives today . \nThe similarity between the two events is that human error caused problems to be amplified leading to failure . \nIn Three Mile Island , safety systems composed of multiple backup systems ultimately saved the situation and prevented adverse effects on the public . \nThis was not the case for the BP disaster because there were no redundancy of diverse safety systems . \nDeep sea drilling could learn a lot from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission -LRB- NRC -RRB- of the US government that places regulations on the nuclear industry and enforces such . \nIt 's time for corporate\\/business punishments to exceed the gross revenue to have been derived from the incident 's resource . \nIf they had to give over the expected revenues from the well , they would not make mistakes . \nIf one well would break the company , then it should n't be in business . \nSmall fry should n't be in big business . \nNo more wrist slaps . \nTime to reform ALL businesses\\/types of incorporation excess . \nFinancial , Energy , et al , ad nauseum . \nCorporate aristocracy needs be tore down , rebuilt . \nEstimates vary , but they 'll still be `` cleaning up '' Hanford until at least 2040 . \nAt TMI , `` cleanup '' appears to amount largely to not talking about the extent of the core meltdown or how much radioactive gas really escaped . \nExxon has n't paid up all the court-ordered damages it owes on the 1989 Valdez catastrophe . \nBP has yet to show much comprehension of the nature and extent of damage caused by it and\\/or its contract partners over several recent events . \nFair enough , these disasters are n't all the same . \nJust , there 's too many of them involving the same sort of happy-go-lucky amateur executives with connections in high places , is all . \nJust wondering if there were any fines or penalties for the management or companies responsible for the `` Three Mile Island '' disaster . \nIt would be great if someone has a link they could send me respecting this information . \nThank you We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nJohn joined Reuters in 2008 as one of its first financial columnists , specialising in commodities and energy . \nWhile his main focus is on oil markets , he has written broadly on the emergence of commodities as an asset class , regulatory issues and macroeconomic themes . \nBefore joining Reuters , John spent seven years as a senior analyst for Sempra Commodities -LRB- now part of JP Morgan -RRB- covering base metals and crude oil . \nPreviously , he worked as an analyst on world trade , banking and financial regulation for consultancy Oxford Analytica .

{"txt": "By the CNN Wire Staff NEW : A U.S. official says Egypt 's government and the opposition should talk now NEW : An Egyptian official chastises the U.S. for `` vague '' statements on the transition U.S. , Egyptian officials discuss ways to `` move '' the political process , a spokesman says U.S. officials , lawmakers have upped their public pressure on Mubarak 's government Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As they talked publicly in generalities about a smooth transition to a new government in Egypt , U.S. officials have been working behind the scenes on ways to `` move that process forward , '' a national security spokesman said . \nTop members of the Obama administration stated Thursday their desire for embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to leave office and for inclusive negotiations to begin immediately with his political opponents . \n`` `` We 're working behind the scenes on ways to move that process forward , '' National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said . \nBut Vietor stressed `` all of those decisions must be made by the Egyptian people . '' \nA senior Obama administration official knocked down a New York Times report that the Egyptians and Americans were near consensus on a specific proposal . \nEgypt losing a lot of money Hosni Mubarak : In his words Crowley : We 're worried about the media Camera rolls as Cooper , crew attacked `` It 's simply wrong to report that there 's a single U.S. plan that 's being negotiated with the Egyptians , '' the official said . \nU.S. officials have made clear in recent days their desire to jumpstart talks between opposition and ruling forces in order to lay the groundwork as soon as possible for a governmental transition . \nThat includes pressuring , besides Mubarak 's government , opposition groups to engage immediately in talks . \nMubarak has announced he will not seek re-election in September . \nProtesters , however , continue to demand that he step down immediately , with a caretaker unity government running the country until the fall elections . \nWhile some , like former Foreign Minister and Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa , believe concessions made by Mubarak presented an opportunity to build upon , members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood have insisted no talks should take place until the president leaves office . \n`` It 's time for both of them to roll up their sleeves , '' a senior State Department official said . \n`` The government has to take some steps , but the opposition has to be willing to participate in negotiations as well . '' \nEgyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman made `` important statements '' about a political dialogue , the senior official said . \nStill , he added that the Egyptian government should allow the opposition to bring its own ideas , rather than dictate the pace and scope of a transformation to democracy . \nThe urgent call for talks comes as the Egyptian government pushed back on what it described as `` vague '' statements from the Obama administration about the pace of transition . \nAn Egyptian government official told CNN the White House has shown support for its `` roadmap '' for a transition up to when Mubarak 's term ends in September , but said President Obama 's calls for an `` orderly transition '' are at odds with his call for an immediate one . \nThe official said Mubarak is seen as a `` receding figure '' in Egyptian politics , but warned that deposing him immediately would lead to a murky political process that would make free and fair elections difficult . \nAccording to the Egyptian constitution , the presidency would be transferred to the speaker of the parliament if Mubarak leaves power without enacting certain legislative and constitutional reforms . \n`` Institutionally , there is support in Egypt for this roadmap among the military , vice president and prime minister , '' said the Egyptian official . \nEgypt : Lay of the land Will the Egyptian crisis ever end ? \nU.S. officials said they believe what transpires Friday -- when another massive anti-government protest is expected -- will be an important barometer on whether serious negotiations can take place . \nDemonstrators may be less willing to talk if attacked . \n`` It 's hard to imagine if there is a day of very bad violence , it will lead to the type of dialogue that needs to take place , '' the senior State Department official said . \nThese backroom discussions involving the U.S. and Egyptian political players come as the White House and legislators stepped up their public pressure on Mubarak 's regime . \nOn Thursday , Vice President Joe Biden talked with Suleiman and pressed him that `` credible , inclusive negotiations -LRB- should -RRB- begin immediately '' with opposition political groups , a statement from Biden 's office said . \nThat sentiment was reiterated by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs , who told reporters `` it is important that we all begin to see meaningful steps , and that negotiations take place between the -LRB- current -RRB- government and a broadly based group of members of the opposition as we work through the transition toward free and fair elections . '' \nU.S. lawmakers have also chimed in , with foreign policy veterans Sens. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and John McCain , R-Arizona , among those calling for Mubarak to step aside for the sake of his country and people . \nThursday night , the U.S. Senate gave unanimous approval to a resolution calling for Mubarak to `` immediately begin an orderly and peaceful transition to a democratic political system , including the transfer of power to an inclusive interim caretaker government , in coordination with leaders from Egypt 's opposition , civil society , and military , to enact the necessary reforms to hold free , fair , and internationally credible elections this year . '' \nThe Obama administration also sharply condemned the violence that erupted Wednesday in Cairo , when pro-Mubarak supporters attacked anti-government protesters . \nAt least eight people were killed and 836 injured , according to the Egyptian Health Ministry . \nState Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday `` elements close to the government or ruling party '' carried out the violence . \n`` I do n't think we have a sense of how far up the chain it went , '' he noted . \nThe United States continues to walk a fine diplomatic line in the crisis , encouraging Mubarak to transition from power while stopping short of publicly asking him to step down . \nOfficials say the restraint is needed because the White House is mindful that allies in the Middle East are concerned about American loyalty . \nGovernment contacts have expressed reservations about how vocal the Obama administration has been in pressing Mubarak , a close American ally of three decades . \nOther regional allies are concerned about how quickly the United States might turn on them if protests start in their countries , the State Department officials said . \nThe White House , meanwhile , has made a deliberate decision to let Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , take the lead role in communicating with the Egyptian military about its role in the current unrest , according to two senior U.S. officials . \nMullen has not told Egyptian military leaders to pressure Mubarak to step down , the officials insisted to CNN . \n`` That 's not his role , '' one official said . \nMullen is , however , trying to push the Egyptian military to maintain security , not move against peaceful protesters , and keep the violence from escalating . \nThe U.S. government believes Mubarak will not issue a direct order to the Egyptian army to do anything because he is uncertain his orders would be followed , one official with very direct knowledge of evolving U.S. policy in the crisis told CNN . \nA refusal on the part of the army to obey Mubarak would spell the end of the Egyptian leader 's rule , the official noted . \nAt that point , Mubarak would have to leave the country . \nThe U.S. belief right now , the official said , is that Suleiman is letting the army feel it is `` representing the flag of the nation '' in trying to help without making a massive move against the government . \nWhile Mullen is communicating with his Egyptian counterparts , the CIA has set up its own task force to monitor the crisis . \n`` The Central Intelligence Agency always surges personnel and resources as needed to meet any crisis head-on . \nThis situation is no different , and we 've established a Middle East Task Force , '' CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said . \n`` Our 24\\/7 operations are focused on ensuring we provide the best possible insights and freshest intelligence to policymakers , '' she said . \nThe chaotic situation has raised concerns that terrorist entities could try to exploit the situation . \n`` People are watching for signs that terrorists or militant groups might try to take advantage of the situation in Cairo and launch attacks , '' a U.S. official noted . \n`` We expect groups like al Qaeda to take advantage of instability anywhere as a means to promote their cause publicly . '' \nOverall , the Obama administration is handling the Egyptian crisis relatively well so far , according to Nicholas Burns , a former Clinton State Department official . \n`` We 've got to stand up , as the president is doing , for reform and democracy , '' Burns told CNN . \nThe U.S. government needs to `` use our influence behind the scenes , and we 've got a lot of influence there with President Mubarak to move him towards a fast transition . '' \nBurns noted the importance of Egypt in terms of the Arab-Israeli conflict , shipments through the Suez Canal , and the containment of Iran , among other things . \n`` We 've got to preserve those very real American interests , '' he said . \n`` This is about as difficult a challenge diplomatically as I think we have seen in many years .

{"txt": "ANTAKYA , Turkey\\/ISTANBUL | Fri Oct 7 , 2011 12:11 pm EDT ANTAKYA , Turkey\\/ISTANBUL -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Turkey is piling pressure on Syria with border military exercises , economic sanctions and the harboring of Syrian opposition groups and army defectors , but Ankara must tread carefully to avoid arousing the suspicion of Arab states or spurring Syrian counter-measures . \nTurkey has shifted , in the space of six months , from being Syria 's new best friend forever to a center of gravity for opposition to President Bashar al-Assad outside the country . \nTurkey 's support for the uprising in Syria has helped galvanize the Syrian opposition , which has taken control of swathes of the country in a wave of popular uprisings against Assad 's 41-year rule . \nSyrian dissidents abroad , and some who have managed to sneak out of the country , have flocked to Istanbul over the past few months to give the revolution a united political front . \nAnd Turkey has given sanctuary to the most senior Syrian military officer to defect , while this week it began maneuvers in a province over which Syria has had longstanding claims . \n`` Turkey is clearly taking sides now , '' said Cengiz Aktar , professor at Istanbul 's Bahcesehir University . \n`` Turkey expects this opposition and the upheaval in the country will eventually finish the job and the revolution will bring an end to the regime . '' \nBut Turkey 's policy shift , which has aligned Ankara more closely with the West , comes with risks . \n`` Syrian intelligence might use every opportunity to instigate Kurdish violence , '' Aktar said , referring to Turkey 's restive minority population . \nAktar said Turkey , whose clout in the Middle East has grown out of a combination of economic growth and secular democracy , could see goodwill evaporate if it is perceived to be meddling in Syria . \n`` At the end of the day , Turkey risks being told to mind its own business and to first put its house in order . \nThe more it wants to be a soft power the more it is going to be told by the international community to apply the same standards with its Kurds minority . '' \nFor all their closeness over the past decade , the two countries almost went to war in the late 1990s over Syria giving refuge to Kurdish militants fighting the Turkish state . \nLiving under Turkish protection , Syrian Colonel Riad al-As ` aad exhorts his former comrades to desert to organize the armed struggle he believes is needed to drive Assad from power . \n`` We assure them -LRB- the Syrian people -RRB- they should be patient , and God willing , very soon , Bashar will be between their hands , '' As ` aad told Reuters in an interview on Thursday . \n-LRB- nL5E7L642X -RRB- `` We must be patient . \nWe hope the Syrian people will be stronger and remain committed to continue to bring down the regime . '' \nRevolted by the killing of Syrian civilians , and seeing the tide of history turn with the `` Arab Spring '' of popular uprisings , Turkey has calculated that its long term interest lies in supporting the Syrian people 's struggle for democracy . \nThat Syria , like Turkey , has a Sunni Muslim majority , while Assad and his clique belong to the Alawite minority , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , made that choice even simpler . \nThe breakdown in their relationship leaves Iran as Syria 's closest backer , though the Russian and Chinese vetoes earlier this week of a U.N. Security Council draft resolution censuring Syria showed Assad retains some support elsewhere . \nAnti-Assad factions meeting in Istanbul -- ranging from Islamists through liberals , along with ethnic and tribal leaders -- have coalesced under a revolutionary Syrian National Council with a stated aim of ousting Assad within six months . \nOffering itself as a potential future interim government , this broad-based opposition group has helped instill some confidence among governments , like Turkey , who disapprove of Assad but had not known who to support . \nHitherto , they have feared Assad 's fall would leave Syria without a central authority capable of stopping the country sliding into religious , sectarian and ethnic violence . \nOne Western diplomat , asked about Turkey 's hesitation in the past to ditch Assad , said Ankara had come to see Assad as `` the devil we know . '' \nTurkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , who had previously enjoyed a close rapport with Assad , is expected to visit a camp in the border province of Hatay sheltering some of the 7,500 Syrians who have fled the violence at home . \nDue to the death of his mother , Erdogan delayed a visit that had been set for Sunday , but he has already promised to announce sanctions against the Syrian government . \nTurkey is expected to freeze bank accounts held by members of Assad 's inner circle , cut ties with Syrian state banks , and halt deals between state-run companies , notably in oil and gas , while avoiding measures that could hurt the people . \nErdogan predicted last month that Assad will be ousted `` sooner or later , '' but how far he is willing to go to make it happen is an open question . \n`` What we have at the moment ... is a war of words between Assad and Erdogan , '' said Gareth Jenkins , an Istanbul-based security analyst . \n`` It 's a bit like two jilted lovers , because they were very , very close . \nThere is a lot of personal spite . '' \nCompounding tensions this week , Turkey began military exercises in Hatay province , which Syria has had longstanding claims over since it was ceded to Turkey in 1939 when France controlled Syria and Lebanon . \nThe exercises , relatively small-scale logistical drills involving a large contingent of less experienced reservist troops , are seen as a symbolic reminder to Damascus that the second largest army in NATO is just across the border . \n`` It is part of the Turkish government 's campaign to apply increased psychological pressure on the regime in Damascus because previous warnings have gone unheeded , '' said Fadi Hakura , analyst at Chatham House think-tank in London . \nTurkey has begun intercepting arms bound for Syria passing through its waters and air space . \nSome analysts say it is easy to foresee Turkey eventually helping to equip and organize Syrian rebels , like Colonel As ` aad , who want to wage an armed struggle against those units of Assad 's security forces leading the repression of protesters . \nOther analysts believe it would be a mistake for Turkey to go beyond support for peaceful protests by letting itself become a rear base for an armed opposition or being seen as a provocateur in Syria 's internal conflict , especially if it developed a stronger sectarian dimension . \nTurkey , after all , is vulnerable to mischief-making among ethnic Kurds and developments that could cause unease within its own Alevi minority community . \nSpeculation keeps resurfacing that Turkey 's military could end up entering Syria to create a buffer zone for the protection of Syrians from Assad 's security forces . \nDuring the 1991 Gulf War , about half a million Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey , returning only after Western powers , along with Turkish contingents , set up a safe haven across the border . \nBut analysts see this option still as a last resort for Ankara , and one that is unlikely to be taken without first getting a U.N. mandate . \nAs it has done in other Arab countries gripped by upheaval , Turkey has played on sentimental attachments to the Ottoman era , when Istanbul counted vast swathes of Arabia , North Africa and the Balkans among its dominions . \nWhereas Erdogan has earned admiration among Arabs for championing the Palestinian cause and leading democratic change in Turkey , analysts say Arabs would not like to see Turkish troops crossing into Syria . \n`` I do n't think Turkey ... would be stupid enough to intervene militarily , '' Jenkins said . \n`` The Arab world does n't want to see Turkish boots on the ground in an Arab country .

{"txt": "BP switches on live video from oil leak Gush of oil from Deepwater Horizon oil spill now being broadcast live after BP accused of withholding information from ocean floor A still of live video from the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico . \nPhotograph : Spillcam One month after the fiery collapse of the Deepwater Horizon , BP bowed to demands from scientists and members of Congress this week and has posted a live video feed of the gusher of oil on the ocean floor . \nThe decision came only hours after a hearing in Congress in which BP was accused of withholding data from the ocean floor , and blocking efforts by independent scientists to come up with estimates for the amount of crude spewing into the Gulf each day . \nEd Markey , who presided over the hearing , said BP would post the footage on the website of his house subcommitte on energy independence and global warming as early as Wednesday night . \nIt was delayed but is now live . \nThe footage could help defuse rising anger at BP from scientists and news organizations at the oil company 's reluctance even to discuss the size of the spill . \nBP has refused to share data gathered by cameras on its submersible robots . \nIts officials have also insisted repeatedly that it is impossible to determine the size of the spill . \nThe lack of disclosure put BP under fire yesterday . \n`` Oil has been spewing into the ocean for 30 days yet the true extent of this spill remains a mystery , '' an angry Markey told the hearing yesterday . \n`` BP thinks this is their ocean so they should control information about the spill . '' \nThe Obama administration too was criticised for sticking to its early estimates of 5,000 barrels a day a much lower estimate than those produced by independent scientists . \nThe coast guard said this week it was assembling a team of experts to produce an estimate of the spill . \nEarlier yesterday , four independent scientists told Markey 's committee that BP 's refusal to release the footage was blocking independent efforts to estimate the size of the spill . \nRichard Camilli , a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute , said BP had intitially reached out to experts for help in measuring the spill . \nHe was set to fly to Houston to join the effort at 3am on 5 May . \nA day later , BP called off the visit . \n`` The rationale was that they were on a very tight time schedule , '' he said . \n`` The greater priority was to place the containment structure over the main leak '' an effort that failed . \nFrank Muller-Karger , an oceanographer at the University of South Florida , told the hearing the full consequences of the spill or of the chemicals used in the clean-up effort remained unknown . \n`` I think this is a problem we are going to have to live with for years rather than months , '' he said . \nBefore last night 's decision , BP had released just two short pieces of video from the ocean floor frustrating scientists who had been trying to estimate the size of the spill . \nBut experts still managed to use the first clip , which was barely 30 seconds long and low-resolution , to produce estimates that were many times larger than the Obama administration estimate of 5,000 barrels a day . \nSteve Wereley , an associate professor at Purdue University who was also at yesterday 's briefing , came up with an estimate of 70,000 barrels a day . \nHe told the committee yesterday he could not conceive of a scenario where the flow of oil from the ruptured well was only 5,000 barrels a day . \n`` All outsider estimates are considerably higher than BP 's .

{"txt": "As casualties soar , America 's women face reality of front line Joanna Walters reports from New York on how Iraq is changing the face of warfare Sunday 1 May 2005 02.34 BST Facing the highest ever casualty rate for servicewomen in its history , America is considering making official what is already a reality - allowing women to fight on the front line in war . \nThe ground war in Iraq has made the historical tradition of not having women in combat unworkable . \nA total of 35 US servicewomen have now died in Iraq and 271 have been injured . \nIt is a small percentage of the 1,500 US service personnel fatalities and the 11,600 wounded , but these women are being killed and injured under enemy fire . \nDawn Huff was one of the first women to die in Iraq . \n`` I think it is time to open the door to women in the armed forces , '' Dawn Huff said . \nShe was 18 and died on 18 April when her convoy was blown up by a roadside bomb . \n` Beneath that beautiful young lady was a backbone of steel , ' her sergeant , Sam Jones , wrote in a letter read aloud at her hometown funeral in Tucson , Arizona . \nHuff 's parents reluctantly let her join the army when she was 16 and she quickly gained a reputation for enthusiasm and grit . \n` She 's the bravest kid I 've ever known , ' said her father , Robert Huff . \n` She was up and down that damned road between Baghdad and the airport , which is notorious for improvised explosive devices . \nBut she knew the risks and believed in the mission . ' \nDawn Halfaker was arguably more fortunate than Huff . \nThe 25-year-old Californian is home from Iraq now and has been spending time before attending post-graduate college snowboarding and playing basketball - with one arm . \nShe had already been in firefights and had killed insurgents when she went on a routine reconnaissance patrol with her military police platoon in Baquoba one night last year . \nThey were ambushed and a rocket-propelled grenade screamed into her armored vehicle . \nIt tore off the arm of Sergeant Norberto Lara , sending the limb flying into the driver 's lap , then exploded at Halfaker 's shoulder , blasting her head and arm . \nMedics kept her alive until they reached a base , where her last words before passing out were : ` You bastards better not cut my arm off . ' \nShe woke up an amputee , dreams of becoming a professional basketball player as shattered as her body . \nBut she has no regrets about being a soldier in a modern war zone . \n` Woman in combat is not really an issue . \nIt is happening , ' she said . \nFighting insurgents across Iraq makes for a chaotic battlefield . \n` Everyone pretty much acknowledges there are no rear battle areas , no forward line of troops , ' said Halfaker . \nFour women died under enemy fire in the Gulf war , where female troops made headlines flying combat aircraft , driving supply trucks close to the front lines and being taken as prisoners of war . \nEight servicewomen died during the Vietnam war - all nurses - and hundreds have died in previous conflicts , but as auxiliary troops or medics serving far to the rear , succumbing most often to disease and accidents . \nIn 1994 Bill Clinton opened up 90 per cent of military jobs to women . \nBut although that meant they could officially go into combat by air and by sea , they were and still are barred from units that go on the offensive on land , including the general infantry , the marines and the special forces , and from units that accompany those troops . \nArmy documents have now surfaced , however , recommending a lifting of the ban on women in units serving alongside other units that primarily go into combat . \nOfficials say it is no more than a discussion document at this stage , others say it is the first step towards sanctioning women in land combat . \n` The government will probably not deal with this until the Iraq conflict is over , otherwise , if it went the wrong way , they could face having to pull the women out of Iraq who are there now , who are de facto in combat , ' said Lory Manning , a retired navy captain and director of the Centre For Women in Uniform in Washington DC . \nWomen are firing missiles from helicopters , but are not yet going on the offensive on the ground in Iraq , Manning said . \nBut they are returning fire in ways never seen before . \nParatrooper Kellie McCoy of St Louis , Missouri , has just returned to Iraq after a break following her award of a bronze star with a rare ` V ' for valor . \nMcCoy , 29 , was only on her third day in Iraq last September when her convoy ran into an ambush during the attack on Falluja . \nShe cranked out machine-gun rounds until she had killed enough of the enemy to break through and escape , rescuing others on the way . \n` Captain McCoy willingly and repeatedly took action to gather up her soldiers under enemy fire and direct fire at the enemy , ' her citation stated . \n` Her actions inspired her men to accomplish the mission and saved the lives of her fellow soldiers . ' \nSuch tributes , and they are few but not isolated , rebuff the myth that men ca n't go to war with women because sexual tensions or their urge to protect them will sink morale . \nAnd the argument that the public would not stand for news of servicewomen coming home in coffins has not been borne out . \nWomen are being awarded bronze stars and record numbers are receiving the booby prize of the wounded , the Purple Heart . \nOne such is Major Ladda Duckworth , the most severely wounded of five female amputees in rehab at Walter Reed Army Hospital . \nThe Black Hawk pilot lost both legs and a huge chunk of one arm when her helicopter was shot down . \nStaff were shocked when she was brought in . ' \nI think they had not seen a female that badly mutilated , ' said 37-year-old Duckworth , from Illinois . \nNow all she wants is to fly again and says she joined the ranks because ' I wanted to take the same risks as the guys . ' \nBut Elaine Donnelly , president of the Centre for Military Readiness in Washington , still argues that : ` The concept of equality does not fit in combat environments . \nThe nation has got used to the idea of women dying in combat , and I do n't think that 's a good thing . ' \nManning points out that no one wants to see combat casualties of either gender and says none of the deaths in Iraq is justified - because the war itself is not . \n` But if you are going to fight wars , women have to be there , and they have shown how tough they can be when they need to be , ' she added .

{"txt": "Fears about the global crisis helped Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's Conservative Party gain seats in Tuesday 's vote . \n-LRB- By Mike Ridewood -- Getty Images -RRB- TORONTO , Oct. 15 -- While the United States reels from the global financial crisis , with credit markets still frozen and stock prices careening from highs to lows , Canada has remained relatively insulated . \nThere is no Lehman Brothers Brothers or Bear Stearns . \nThere is no subprime mortgage or home foreclosure mess . \nAnd while the United States fears a prolonged recession , Canadians have remained relatively sanguine , convinced that they are in a good position to weather the economic tsunami from the south . \n`` We will be pulled down , '' said Michael Gregory , chief economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns , an investment firm . \n`` Not as deep , not as long . '' \nThe main reason for optimism here is the banking system . \nExperts here note that Canadian banks are more tightly regulated , more liquid and less highly leveraged . \nInstead of being highflying investment banks , they tend to operate in a more traditional manner , with large numbers of loyal depositors and a more solid base of capital . \n`` I think the regulatory framework in Canada is a little more stringent , '' Gregory said , `` and Canadian banks are a little more conservative in terms of lending . '' \nThe World Economic Forum this month rated Canada 's banks as the world 's soundest , ahead of banks in Sweden and Luxembourg . \nAccording to the Canadian Banking Association , one reason for the system 's solidity is that banks are national in scope . \nEach of the largest five institutions has branches in all 10 Canadian provinces , meaning they are less susceptible to regional downturns and they can move capital from region to region , as needed . \n`` As far as I am aware , no American bank has branches in all 50 states , '' banking association spokesman Andrew Addison wrote in an e-mail . \nStrict rules also govern mortgage lending . \nBy Canadian law , any mortgage that will finance more than 80 percent of the price of a home must be insured . \nTwo-thirds of all Canadian mortgages are insured by the quasi-governmental Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp. . \nAs a result of the tough standards for insurance , `` people tend not to get mortgages they can not afford , '' Gregory said . \nDefaulting on a loan is also more difficult in Canada than the United States , Gregory said . \n`` You ca n't just drop off the keys and walk away . '' \nFor Canada 's seven biggest banks , the percentage of mortgages at least three months in arrears was 0.27 percent in July , close to historic lows , according to the banking association . \nAlso , few Canadian banks got caught holding large numbers of toxic American mortgages . \nAnother difference is that in Canada , mortgage interest is not tax-deductible , making it harder to buy a house . \nAs a result , Canada did not have as strong a construction surge as the United States did during the boom years , and thus does not now have a big oversupply . \nPeople do not take out mortgages just for the tax break . \nIn Canada , `` a mortgage is seen as something you want to get rid of as fast as possible , '' said Peter Dungan , an economist with the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto . \nAmid this relative health , there have been reports that American companies , needing cash and credit , have been turning to their Canadian subsidiaries for short-term loans . \nBut Canada 's economy has not been entirely trouble-free . \nThe Toronto Stock Exchange is down . \nThe appreciation of the Canadian dollar has harmed exports . \nThe slowdown in the United States -- which takes 80 percent of Canada 's exports -- has a direct impact here . \nIn particular , the American housing troubles have hurt because much of the wood in new U.S. houses comes from Canada . \n`` What Americans are not buying is directly what we export , '' Dungan said . \nFears about the global crisis helped Prime Minister Stephen Harper increase his Conservative Party 's presence in Parliament in Tuesday 's elections , many analysts here believe , though the party still fell short of an absolute majority . \nHarper called the election in September , just before the crisis hit . \nAfter some initial verbal stumbles -- he at first seemed to play down the fall of the Toronto exchange -- he campaigned as the steady hand to see Canada through hard economic times ahead . \nPolls showed that the economy was the main issue in the election .

Nature can not adapt , '' he said of BP 's 85-day spill . \nApart from being eaten by bacteria , oil can evaporate and is broken down by sunlight . \nEnvironmentalists say that the existence of seeps should not be a backdoor justification for dumping oil in the seas that can kill creatures from turtles to pelicans . \n`` While these seeps can release large amounts of oil , the rate is usually very slow , which allows the surrounding ecosystems to adapt , '' environmental group Oceana said in a report . \nOther species are unable to adapt and die . \nJernelov estimates BP 's leak , the worst in U.S. history , at 250,000 to 400,000 tonnes by early this month , compared with 140,000 tonnes leaking naturally every year from seeps in the seabed in the Gulf of Mexico alone . \nOn land , one of the biggest natural oil ponds is Trinidad 's Pitch Lake -- English mariner Walter Raleigh used its pitch to caulk his ship in 1595 . \nOn the seabed , seeps are often hard to locate , are intermittent and seem to seal themselves . \nSome oil companies use the presence of seeps as a guide to exploration . \nOil from each deposit has a distinct chemical makeup . \n`` We 've seen about 1 percent of the sea floor . \nWhen you start finding oil floating around you think it 's from a tanker . \nBut a significant amount comes from below , '' said Martin Hovland , an expert on seeps at the University of Bergen in Norway . \nHe said late Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl was probably wrong to blame human pollution for oil spotted in mid-Atlantic from his Ra raft in 1969 and 1970 . \nThe oil , some encrusted with barnacles and algae , may well have been from a natural seep . \nAnd Hovland said seeps might be far more important in the food chain than believed , perhaps drawing humpback whales to the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California where thick mats of bacteria and other organisms carpet the seabed near seeps . \nSeeps might also explain why the North Sea , rich in oil and gas , has more fish than the nearby Irish Sea , he said . \nThe latest U.S. National Academy of Sciences estimates , in a 2003 study , say seeps account for 600,000 tonnes of oil out of a total 1.3 million tonnes entering the oceans yearly . \nLeaks from human production , transport and consumption account for about 700,000 tonnes a year .

Ambassador to the United States , Moammar Gadhafi , said Tuesday that the U.S.-led international community has joined the international community in calling for an immediate end to the violence in the country . \n`` We have joined the Libyan people in demanding that Gadhafi must go -- now , without further violence or delay -- and we are working to translate the world 's outrage into action and results , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the House Foreign Affairs Committee . \nThe Obama administration is considering whether it should cut diplomatic ties with Libya , a senior U.S. official told CNN . \n`` Whether to maintain relations or sever them is under review , '' the official said . \nU.S. officials have said all options are being considered with respect to Libya . \nUnderscoring that point , the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge and the amphibious transport dock USS Ponce were to be repositioned in the Mediterranean to `` provide us a capability for both emergency evacuations and also for humanitarian relief , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters . \nBut , he noted , the U.N. Security Council has not authorized the use of armed force . \nThe U.N. General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution to suspend Libya from its seat on the 47-member chamber Human Rights Council . \nIt was the first time the assembly had suspended a member of the council . \n`` This is a harsh rebuke -- but one that Libya 's leaders have brought down upon themselves , '' said Ambassador Susan E. Rice , U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations , in a statement . \nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the General Assembly that he welcomed the decision and urged the international community to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Libya . \n`` The world has spoken with one voice , '' he said . \n`` We demand an immediate end to the violence toward civilians and full respect for their fundamental human rights , including those of peaceful assembly and free speech . '' \nShould U.S. arm Libyan rebels ? \nU.N. fears refugee crisis in Libya Guns and oil in rebel controlled Libya Libyan protests : Raw and online He added that reports from the ground `` are sobering , '' with continuing loss of life and ongoing repression . \n`` Arms depots and arsenals have reportedly been opened to gangs who terrorize communities , '' he said . \n`` There are reports that government forces have fired indiscriminately on peaceful protesters and bombed the military bases in the east of the country . '' \n`` The death toll from nearly two weeks of violence is unknown , but likely to exceed 1,000 , '' with thousands more wounded , Ban said , using the same fatality figure he had used Friday . \nLibya 's ambassador to the United States estimated Monday that the death toll was about 2,000 . \nBut Gates stressed the number of casualties is uncertain . \n`` I think the honest answer is that we do n't know , '' he told reporters . \nThe government of Canada has frozen $ 2.3 billion in assets tied to the Libyan government ; the assets were frozen after Canada enacted sanctions over the weekend , Canadian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Lynn Meahan said Tuesday . \nA number of other countries , including the United States , have ordered an asset freeze . \nThough some witnesses have accused pro-Gadhafi forces of firing on civilians from the air , Gates and Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said they could not confirm the reports . \nWhat are U.S. options for Libya ? \nClinton said imposition of a no-fly zone is under consideration , but Mullen said doing so would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' \nA top U.S. general said Tuesday that any effort to establish a no-fly zone over the country would include eliminating Libya 's air defenses . \nIt would be `` challenging , '' U.S. Central Command leader Gen. James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services committee . \nIn western Libya , Ban said , there were reports of ongoing clashes between government forces and armed opponents . \nHe noted `` allegations of extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions and torture . '' \nThough more members of the military have reportedly sided with the opposition , Gadhafi 's supporters `` appear to be holding a tight grip on western parts of the country , chiefly Tripoli , '' he said . \nHe warned of `` serious indications '' that the numbers of refugees and displaced persons were reaching crisis proportions and worried that the violence could disrupt distribution networks and lead to food shortages . \nThe U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya 's borders into Egypt and Tunisia and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders . \nBan called for immediate action by the international community . \n`` Time is of the essence , '' he said . \n`` Thousands of lives are at stake . '' \nIndeed , at the border with Tunisia , many recent arrivals said they had been robbed or forced to pay bribes en route . \nSome said they had been threatened with death . \nOne man said Libyan soldiers used electric cables to beat him as he waited at the airport and demanded $ 500 from him . \nWhen he told them he did n't have it , they said , `` Die then '' and threw him into the street . \nTunisian authorities appeared to be struggling to cope with the arriving wave of refugees . \nVolunteers hurled fresh bread and water into the crowds . \n`` There is nothing for them on that side , '' a policeman turned volunteer said from the Tunisian side of the border . \nHe was one of many Tunisians donating their time to take food , water and supplies to the border . \nMany said they were livid that international organizations were slow in arriving . \nMeanwhile , more parts of the regime have broken off , joining calls for Gadhafi to halt the violence . \nIn London , the Libyan Embassy said it was siding with the opposition , condemning what it called `` all acts of murder and terror '' taking place in Libya . \nThe military situation on the ground was complex : Forces loyal to Gadhafi tried to retake a town near the capital that is under opposition control but were repelled , an opposition leader in the town told CNN Tuesday . \nThe source said pro-Gadhafi troops with tanks and anti-aircraft guns attacked Zawiya from east and west at nightfall Monday , but did not capture the town . \nA senior official in Gadhafi 's regime denied that government forces attacked rebels in Zawiya . \nSenior members of the government told CNN that Zawiya and Misrata are key to their effort to regain control of the country . \nThe officials insisted they want a peaceful resolution , but witnesses have described repeated violent efforts by the regime to regain control of areas Gadhafi has lost . \nZawiya was calm Tuesday , but Gadhafi 's troops remained nearby , the opposition leader and another source in the town said . \nCNN is not naming them to protect their safety . \nMisrata was protected by its residents and military defectors and the situation there on Tuesday was stable , said Abd al Baset Imzeereq , who identified himself as the spokesman for the newly formed city council . \nPro-Gadhafi forces are stationed in the Navy college about 15 kilometers -LRB- nine miles -RRB- outside the city and have not attempted to move into the city center since its fall , he said . \nThe forces appear to be stationed there not to try to retake the city , but to protect the ammunition depot in the college and `` to terrorize the people '' by opening fire on them . \nAt least two farmers were killed Monday when these forces shot at their vehicle , Imzeereq said . \nStill , some semblance of normalcy was visible Tuesday , when some banks had reopened in Misrata and people were able to withdraw money or get loans , he said . \nFood supplies were ample , he said , but medical goods were scarce . \nImzeereq said at least 33 have been killed and another 487 wounded in Misrata since the unrest began . \nThe capital city of Tripoli was quiet Tuesday as more people here also tried to resume normal life . \nPrices of basic goods have increased ; a Tripoli resident said she could not get paid due to unspecified problems in her bank . \nSome residents told CNN they want to protest but fear being killed . \nSaif al-Islam Gadhafi , the leader 's 38-year-old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests , told CNN his talks with the opposition are in `` chaos '' because the opposition is divided , with no clear leaders . \nMany Libyans have rejected the younger Gadhafi 's remarks during the uprising . \nBut U.S. officials made similar comments about the rebel forces . \nA U.S. official who wished to remain nameless because the official was not authorized to speak on the record said it 's `` unclear who the leaders in the opposition are and that makes it difficult '' for the U.S. to provide assistance . \n`` The intelligence community is aggressively pursing information on the ground , '' said the official , who added that the CIA has had a presence in the country for some time . \n`` I think it remains to be seen how effectively military leaders who have defected from Gadhafi 's forces can organize the opposition in the country , '' said Gates . \n`` We are watching that unfold . '' \nOver the past two weeks , government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators and rebel forces , fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets , numerous witnesses have told CNN . \nThe elder Gadhafi made no public appearances Tuesday , but he appeared out of touch on Monday , denying having used force against his people and even denying the existence of the protests . \n`` No demonstration at all in the streets , '' the 68-year-old ruler told ABC and the BBC in a joint interview in Tripoli . \n`` They love me , all my people with me , they love me all . \nThey will die to protect me , my people , '' said Gadhafi , who has controlled Libya for nearly 42 years . \nBut Libya 's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi disagreed . \n`` I do n't believe that even his family loves him at this moment , '' said Dabbashi , who has joined the rebel movement in calling for Gadhafi to step down . \n`` I think no one loves him at all . \nI think the whole Libyan people hate him now . \nWith all the bloodshed , all the killing ... he 's certainly out of his mind .

{"txt": "BEIRUT | Tue Nov 15 , 2011 2:51 pm EST BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Long-restrained tensions in Lebanon over the uprising in its powerful neighbor Syria have burst into the open after an Arab League vote to suspend Damascus -- even bringing politicians to blows on live television . \nDivided over their relationship to Syria , politicians previously trod carefully in statements for or against the Syrian government whose army has been struggling to crush eight months of protests against President Bashar al-Assad . \nBut Saturday 's vote at the Arab League , in which Lebanon was one of only two countries to oppose Syria 's suspension , exposed the depths of divisions in a country where many are linked to Syria by religious , political and family ties , but others have bitter memories of three decades of Syrian military presence in Lebanon . \nThe Lebanese talk show `` With Objectivity '' was abruptly taken off air on Monday evening when local politicians Mustafa Alloush and Fayez Shukr , seated on-set in business suits , started throwing glasses at one another and raising their chairs -- sending insults and papers flying . \nShukr , from Lebanon 's pro-Syrian Baath Party , fumed as Alloush said Assad was `` a liar . '' \nShukr and Alloush , from Lebanon 's anti-Syria opposition parties , then traded expletives . \nPrime Minister Najib Mikati 's government , which is backed by Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian parties , angered the opposition and surprised even some cabinet members by choosing to vote against Syria 's suspension , rather than abstaining as it has done at United Nations votes on Syria . \n`` We are seeing an escalation of political tensions . \nIt is a sign Lebanon is split , '' said Minister of Public Works Ghazi Aridi . \n`` We should have taken a neutral stance ... What we saw on television last night is a direct result of these rising tensions . \nIt 's not only unfortunate and embarrassing , it 's worrying , '' he told Reuters . \nLebanon has maintained relative calm despite the bloodshed across its borders . \nMany Lebanese , haunted by the specter of their 1975-1990 civil war that divided the country along sectarian lines , have been tight-lipped about Syria 's conflict , which many also worry could spiral into sectarian war . \nSome politicians have posted increasingly heated comments on Twitter , which has grown in appeal as a platform for Lebanese political leaders from President Michel Suleiman to former prime minister and opposition leader Saad al-Hariri . \nOn Sunday , after Lebanon 's vote against Syria 's suspension in the Arab League , Hariri posted a string of critiques on the social network . \n`` They will be judged by the Lebanese and the Arabs and by history for their immoral and subservient abandonment of all national and human dignity , '' he wrote , adding that the vote put Lebanon on `` The side of murder , dictatorship and anti-Arab identity . '' \nMikati , who has also become a regular Twitter user , even hosting Twitter debates , defended the vote against Syria 's suspension . \n`` Leadership is not just about followership or giving people what they want to hear , '' he told Twitter followers , arguing the decision to vote was done in the national interest . \nThe prime minister also said he was informed of the on-air political scuffle on Monday : `` Unfortunately , it happens on TV in many democracies ... but , not my style .

{"txt": "' I just want to survive and go home with all my body parts ' Fears of soldiers on patrol in Mosul as US military death toll in Iraq tops 1,500 Friday 4 March 2005 03.27 GMT The city was quiet but the soldiers sitting and swaying inside the Stryker were animated by their favorite debate : was it better to be five metres or 20 metres from an explosion ? \nThe front gunner belonged to the 20-metre school , figuring the greater distance reduced your chances of losing limbs to the blast . \nThe two rear gunners scoffed and said that would increase the odds of being hit by shrapnel , which fanned upwards and outwards . \nFive months of patrolling Mosul had furnished evidence for both views and the discussion was as well-worn as the Stryker 's tyres . \nSergeant David Phillips , 23 , sighed and patted his flak jacket . \n`` I just want to stay alive and go home with all my body parts . '' \nHe spoke for 150,000 American soldiers in Iraq . \nYesterday the number of US military deaths since the March 2003 invasion crept over 1,500 . \nThere was no official acknowledgment of the milestone , just curt statements that three soldiers had died in two separate attacks on Wednesday . \n`` Names are being withheld pending notification of next of kin . '' \nThe figure includes accidents . \nThe daily drip of US casualties passes almost unnoticed now , a footnote to the wider slaughter of Iraqis : five policemen killed in two car bombs yesterday , 13 soldiers killed on Wednesday , a judge on Tuesday , at least 115 police and army recruits and civilians on Monday . \nSome 18,000 civilians are estimated to have died . \nYesterday 's headlines were about the renewal of Iraq 's state of emergency , fresh attacks on oil pipelines , and deadlock between Shias and Kurds over forming a new government . \nThe men of Bravo company , an infantry unit which rides in the armored Stryker vehicles of 321 Battalion in Mosul , did not care that since George Bush 's re-election the artificial limbs and flag-draped coffins of US troops have faded in political significance . \nFor them , it was personal . \n`` I do n't tell my mom or my wife that we drive up and down streets getting blown up every day . \nThey 'd just worry all the time . \nI tell them we sit in the base and do the odd mission , '' said Sgt Nathan Purdy , who is 23 . \nA week embedded with Bravo company , midway through a year-long stint in an insurgent stronghold , showed a group of men with good morale and determination to catch `` bad guys '' but divided over the war and frustrated by an elusive enemy . \nThere was consensus about the reaction when home on leave . \n`` People wanting to buy you drinks , buy you food , wanting to shake your hand , they made you feel a hero , '' said Specialist Matt Sutton , 24 , from Illinois . \nThose from liberal states such as Washington said anti-war activists did not criticise them personally or echo the Vietnam-era chant of baby killer . \n`` The country is behind us . \nThey did n't dare , '' said one lieutenant . \nBravo Company 's quarters are a bombed-out palace in the grounds of Camp Freedom , a sprawl of cabins and concrete shelters . \nMortars land regularly but tend not to hit anything . \nLieutenant Colonel Mike Gibler said his battalion 's main objective was rebuilding the Iraqi security forces which `` imploded '' last November after insurgents overran Mosul 's police stations . \nThe Iraqi army was improving thanks to joint operations and would soon take half of the responsibility of securing the city . \nAsked about the police force he rolled his eyes , but speculated that there was enough progress for US forces to leave within three years . \nHis desk had tomes on Islam and a `` Do n't mess with Texas '' sticker . \nEnlisted men were less sure about progress , complaining they were always on the defensive and waiting to be attacked by insurgents . \n`` They fight like bitches , pop a few shots , then hide , '' said Sgt Ramirez Flores . \nDrive-by shootings have wounded several in the unit but the big fear is roadside bombs which according to the Pentagon accounted for 56 % of all US battle deaths in the first two months of this year . \nThey are hidden in rubbish bags , animal carcasses , holes , rubble , cars and carts , turning every object into a potential killer . \nA suicide car bomber rammed and immolated one of the battalion 's Strykers but all the occupants survived , prompting reverence for the eight-wheel , 23-tonne monsters . \nA tip about weapons caches this week led to a midnight mission to dig up a lawn . \n`` Fucking gardeners - what are we doing here ?

{"txt": "World economic leaders will gather in Washington Saturday for a summit to address the global financial crisis . \nIt is no coincidence that Brazil , China , India and other emerging-market nations have not only been invited to the summit but are expected to play meaningful roles . \nThe credit crunch , which began in the United States , has quickly spread to the developing world . \nThe summit agenda will be dominated by monetary policy coordination and new roles for international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund . \nIn his Nov. 3 op-ed , `` Fairness for Emerging Markets , '' Kemal Dervis made the case for `` making massive credit lines available '' to most emerging-market economies . \nBut if we are to limit the depth of the looming global recession , trade finance must also be on the agenda . \nCross-border lending by banks based in developed countries fell at a record pace in the second quarter and continued its decline at an accelerated rate in the third quarter . \nOne casualty is the drying up of trade finance , the lifeblood of $ 14 trillion annually in global commerce . \nWachovia 's recent troubles , for example , have already led to a sharp reduction in short-term trade finance lines to Latin America . \nOther banks are reassessing credit lines for trading with Asia , Africa and Eastern Europe . \nThe credit crisis has moved into trade finance as largely a funding problem . \nIf bank lines are shut off , it would be devastating for the economies of the developing world . \nIt would also have a boomerang effect on the United States and Europe , as key export markets -- and the jobs that go with them -- disappeared . \nFortunately , there are institutions already built to promote trade finance : export credit agencies . \nThe Export-Import Bank of the United States was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934 , in the midst of the Great Depression . \nIt is a `` lender of last resort '' that provides credit lines when private financial markets are not lending . \nLast year , the bank authorized more than $ 12 billion in guarantees and insurance to support U.S. exporters . \nExport credit agencies have helped mitigate a financial crisis before . \nIn late 1997 , banks were unwilling to provide credit to Asia after currency and equity markets there plunged . \nThe U.S. Export-Import Bank confirmed letters of credit issued by 15 South Korean banks to support the purchase of raw materials and spare parts needed by Korean manufacturers . \nIn February 1998 , 20 official export credit agencies met in London to encourage each other to remain open and to offer new support to exports to Asia . \nThe U.S. Export-Import Bank played its part by initiating a new program for South Korea that month . \nWithin nine months , it supported 2,460 transactions worth more than $ 1 billion for U.S. exporters to sell to Korean firms -LRB- up from only $ 40 million the year before -RRB- . \nSimilar trade credit programs were launched for Indonesia and Thailand . \nThese special short-term lending and trade credit insurance lines played a catalytic role in helping to build confidence in Asia at a critical time -- and helped the region rebound quickly . \nNone of the Korean banks defaulted , and the entire Export-Import Bank Korean program cost American taxpayers not one dime . \nIn the coming days , the U.S. Export-Import Bank and other export credit agencies should take the lead in getting trade finance flowing again . \nFirst , the export credit agencies should convene to share information and confirm credit availability for the pivotal months ahead . \nThe World Trade Organization has called a special meeting of trade finance players for Wednesday , and the subject will be a major topic of discussion at next Monday 's meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . \nBut Saturday 's summit is the venue to push for decisive action . \nSecond , even though the Federal Reserve Bank 's discount window is now available to non-bank institutions , the volume of credit needed suggests it is crucial to find a way for the Export-Import Bank to fund asset-based lenders who support thousands of small suppliers in connection to exports . \nThe bank should institute a new and unprecedented , but temporary , program that provides short-term funding to intermediary lenders . \nThird , with credit markets largely closed , traditional financing sources for medium - and long-term commercial export finance are not available . \nThe Export-Import Bank must revitalize its direct-lending programs , but in ways that continue to engage the institutional skills and delivery capabilities of commercial lenders . \nIt is critical for global prosperity that trade financing -- be it keeping credit lines open , oiling the trade supply chain or direct funding -- remain vibrant during the financial crisis . \nA concerted effort by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and other export credit agencies can make a meaningful difference in how the real economy responds and recovers . \nThe writer is chairman of the Caravel Fund and served as president and chief executive of the Export-Import Bank of the United States during the Clinton administration .

{"txt": "HOUSTON\\/WASHINGTON | Tue Jun 8 , 2010 7:33 pm EDT HOUSTON\\/WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Energy giant BP Plc said on Tuesday it was capturing more oil from its ruptured Gulf of Mexico well while U.S. scientists tried to figure out just how much crude was still pouring out . \nThe London-based company 's share price closed down 5 percent in London after U.S. President Barack Obama said he wanted to know `` whose ass to kick '' over the massive spill . \nThe on-going disaster remains at the top of Obama 's crowded domestic agenda , a point underscored by his strong comments and Tuesday 's announcement that he will head back to the Gulf coast next week to inspect efforts to contain the spill . \nObama will visit Mississippi , Alabama and Florida during a two-day trip beginning on Monday , the White House said . \nThe spill began on April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank , killing 11 workers and causing the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . \nEfforts to contain the mess forged ahead . \nBP said on Tuesday it had collected 14,800 barrels of oil from the leaking well on Monday , 33 percent higher than the amount collected on Sunday and the highest capture rate since it installed a new system last week to contain the spill . \nBP later said it collected 7,850 barrels of oil in the 12-hour stretch ended at noon CDT -LRB- 1700 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday . \nThat brought the total collected since the cap was installed to 51,364 barrels . \nHoping to calm rising passions , BP said it would donate revenues from the oil it is recovering to restore Gulf wildlife habitats . \nThe company had already committed itself to cleaning up after the disaster . \nThe political heat remains intense as the disaster spills over into energy policy in Washington . \nThe Interior Department issued new safety and environmental requirements for companies that want to drill in shallow waters . \nThey have until June 28 to show they have met the new requirements or face being shut down . \nBP chief executive Tony Hayward was called to testify , for the first time , at a congressional hearing on June 17 that will focus on the company 's role in the rig explosion and subsequent spill . \nBP said he would attend . \nAnother congressional committee investigating the spill sent a letter to rig operator Transocean that questioned whether the company had enough people working on Deepwater Horizon at the time of the explosion . \nAfter the spill , the Obama administration imposed a six-month moratorium on new drilling permits for exploration and development wells in waters deeper than 500 feet . \nU.S. officials also refused to approve new drilling in shallow waters until new rules were issued . \nCoast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top U.S. official overseeing the cleanup effort , said on Monday neither BP nor the government knew just how much oil was gushing out of the well . \n`` That 's the big unknown right now , '' he said . \nBP has given conservative estimates of the oil flow that have been ridiculed by scientists and U.S. lawmakers . \nEven the government 's much higher estimates of 12,000-19 ,000 barrels a day seemed on the low side after Allen said the company planned to double its collection of oil from the well to 20,000 barrels every day -LRB- 840,000 gallons\\/3 .18 million liters -RRB- . \nAllen said on Tuesday U.S. scientists would present revised estimates later this week or early next week . \nThe panel of experts has said BP 's latest effort to contain the oil spill could actually increase the flow rate by up to 20 percent . \nBP and government officials have said a definitive solution will not come until August when a relief well is drilled . \nObama , who faces growing criticism that he has appeared detached from the economic and ecological catastrophe hitting four U.S. Gulf states , sharpened his criticism of BP in an interview with NBC 's `` Today '' show that aired on Tuesday . \nObama said he was talking to experts to find out what had gone wrong `` so I know whose ass to kick '' over the spill , which has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline and threatens the Gulf Coast 's lucrative fishing industry . \nFadel Gheit , an analyst at Oppenheimer and Co , said it was `` not a coincidence '' that BP 's shares were down after Obama 's comments increased pressure on the company to fix the mess . \nIn New York , BP 's American depositary shares fell more than 5 percent , mirroring the losses in earlier London trading . \nTransocean shares also tumbled in New York , trading to their lowest in 18 months , as the market worried about the company 's liability for the oil disaster . \nBP shares have lost about a third of their value since the crisis erupted . \nInvestors are worried about the size of the final bill for the spill , expected to be in the billions . \nThe company has already spent more than $ 1 billion on cleaning up the slick , which has fouled wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama and also sent tar balls ashore on beaches in Florida . \nOne-third of the Gulf 's federal waters , or 78,000 square miles -LRB- 200,000 square km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing , and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing . \nU.S. weather forecasters gave their first confirmation on Tuesday that some of the oil leaking from BP 's well has lingered beneath the surface rather than rising to the top . \nUndersea oil depletes the water 's oxygen content and threatens marine life like mussels , clams , crabs , eels and shrimp . \nIn Fort Jackson in southern Louisiana , the New Orleans Saints , winners of the National Football League 's Superbowl in February , held a rally to help lift the spirits of communities reeling from the spill . \n`` I came out to support the Saints and to try and get my mind off the oil spill . \nThis team has meant everything to the state of Louisiana , '' said local homemaker Laura Bartholomew . \nHundreds of fans , many wearing black and gold jerseys , braved scorching temperatures to attend the rally . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWe ca n't expect anything else from them other than trying to maximize profits at all costs . \nIt 's our government that has let us down . \nLack of regulation and the cozy relationship with the oil industry and their money has lead us to this moment . \nNow that the White House is being deluged with emails urging him to show something , he 's coming out acting tough . \nToo little too late , my man . \nYou have lost our trust and will need to earn it back . \nPass comprehensive campaign reform . \nWe vote for them and then they listen to the lobbyists and not us . \nStop playing politics and start leading . \nOr else the Republicans will be back in power with their insane `` we do n't need government '' bull crap . \nWhy spend this much time coming up with solutions to produce the well ? \nIf the cement job is holding and the 9-5\\/8 ? \nseal assembly is\\/was working . . \nwhy not disconnect the BOP at the wellhead connector ... raise the stack ... cut the drill pipe fish with shears they used on the riser ... and skid a new stack in place -LRB- with blind rams in each cavity -RRB- ... reconnect to the wellhead and close

With the help of God , we will embark on freedom , '' a comment on a Facebook page run by activists said . \nEmergency rule has been used since Assad 's Baath Party seized power to justify arbitrary arrests and detention and a ban on all opposition . \nAssad 's conciliatory move to lift the state of emergency followed a familiar pattern since the unrest began a month ago : pledges of reform are made before Friday when demonstrations are the strongest , and are usually followed by an intense crackdown . \nThe authorities have blamed armed groups , infiltrators and Sunni Muslim militant organizations for provoking violence at demonstrations by firing on civilians and security forces . \nWestern and other Arab countries have mostly muted their criticism of the killings in Syria for fear of destabilizing the country , which plays a strategic role in many of the conflicts in the Middle East . \nSyria is technically at war with Israel but has kept its Golan Heights front with the Jewish state quiet since a 1974 ceasefire . \nIt has long borders with Iraq , and supports the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and the Shi'ite Hezbollah movement in neighboring Lebanon , also backed by Iran . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOn the other hand Cuba have seen democracy in the horizon for more than 40 years and figure out that it is just something in the horizon anyhow . \nThe smorgasbord is to small even if you would taste the communism . \nThe problem in Syria is not really the Emergency Law or other similar repressive laws on the books . \nOver the past 50 years of the Assad family dictatorship the pervasive state security apparatus has grown so entrenched and autonomous that it heeds no laws . \nThe feared mukhabarat , as the shadowy state security services are known in Syria , never think of law and order when they kidnap , torture , or disappear freedom activists . \nThe only way for the Assad regime is to disband the 15 + state security agencies it created over the decades and hand the power back to a new reformed judicial system , the first step in a transition of power to a democratically elected civilian government . \nThis would certainly mean the end of the Assad family rule of Syria and end to the monopoly on power by the small Allawite minority . \nIt would be very courageous of Bashar Al Assad to take such action and would save him and his children , but many of his relatives and close associates will be brought to justice over their past human rights abuses , especially the genocide in the city of Hama in 1982 . \nWithout this Syria is heading toward a vicious civil war in which the biggest losers will be the Alawites themselves . \nIt is in this minority 's best interest to negotiate a peaceful and orderly exit from power with the least bloodshed . \nThe Alawites need to be told by the international community that it is now 25 years after the fall of the Soviet Union , their protector , and that there are officials and ex-officials amongst them that are unsavable under international law for their bloody pasts . \nThe minority and its future should not be sacrificed for them . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/syriancrisis_reuters/rsd/SyrianCrisis_reuters__2011-04-21__2.rsd.txt.app-auth-final"}

'' \nHayward , who was dubbed `` the most hated and most clueless man in America '' last week , is handing responsibility for running the clean-up operation to its American director , Bob Dudley . \nThis may assuage some of the fury vented at the British company , which faces calls for its US assets to be seized . \nOfficial estimates put the leak anywhere between 12,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil a day , and it is not clear how successful the containment cap will be . \nBP has said it collected around 10,000 barrels on Sunday and hopes to eventually capture most of the leak , but the US coastguard is being much more cautious . \n`` I 'm hoping we catch as much oil as we can , but I 'm withholding any comment until production is at a full rate , '' said Thad Allen , the US coastguard admiral . \nOil from the stricken wellhead has now reached the beaches of Alabama and Florida , widening the environmental damage caused by the spill , despite 2.2 m ft -LRB- 6.7 km -RRB- of containment boom being deployed . \nThere are also 2,600 boats involved in the response effort . \nBP said it has paid compensation totalling $ 48m to 18,000 individuals out of a total of 37,000 compensation claims . \nPresident Barack Obama , who has also been criticised for his approach to the catastrophe , said yesterday it was `` brutally unfair '' that ordinary fishermen and shopkeepers were seeing their businesses damaged by the spill . \n`` If laws were broken , those responsible will be brought to justice , '' Obama said yesterday . \n`` We will make sure they pay every single dime owed to the people along the Gulf coast .

Thad Allen and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal aboard Marine One on May 2 as they fly along the coastline from Venice , La. . \n`` Let me be clear : BP is responsible for this leak ; BP will be paying the bill , '' Obama said while touring the area Sunday . \nThe administration 's response to the spill has been complicated by the fact that the federal government has placed a $ 20 billion liability cap on the company 's liability for the spill , a cap that can not be lifted until an investigation is complete . \nAdministration officials insist BP will be held responsible anyway , noting that if the company is found negligent or criminally liable , the cap disappears . \nClaims also can potentially be made under other state or federal laws , officials said . \nYet the liability cap is problematic enough that a trio of Democratic senators introduced legislation Monday raising it to $ 10 billion , and the administration quickly announced its support . \nSens.

{"txt": "LONDON | Tue Jul 26 , 2011 1:15 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The popular upheaval in Syria is growing bolder and the cracks in the establishment are getting deeper -- yet there is a long and bloody road ahead if protesters are to unseat President Bashar al-Assad and end his family 's 40 years in power . \nThe price of stalemate is rising daily : sectarian mayhem , a growing protest movement and a faltering economy , with no sign that Bashar and his minority Alawite clan are considering an exit strategy after four decades in power . \nYet so far , there is no sign of a tipping point that would assure success for protesters , as in Tunisia and Egypt , where millions took to the streets to topple autocratic leaders . \n`` The situation has not reached a critical mass , '' said Patrick Seale , biographer of Bashar 's father , Hafez al-Assad . \n`` Damascus has n't risen , the security services have n't split yet , the economy has n't collapsed . \nThe regime looks weak and the opposition looks weaker , '' he said . \nAnalysts say the Homs killings were provoked by a ferocious security clampdown . \n`` More than 100 bodies had been found , '' Bashar al-Assad said in a televised address . \nThe Alawite sect , an off-shoot of Shi'ite Islam , is a minority in Syria , which has a Sunni Muslim majority , as well as smaller numbers of Druze , Christians and non-Arab Kurds . \nA group of Alawite men , including four security men , went missing on July 14 . \nThe bodies of four of them were found killed . \nSome Alawites from their neighbourood in Homs took to the streets , torched and destroyed shops belonging to Sunnis . \nThe danger of sectarian strife is real , analysts say . \nIt might even appeal to the authorities -- and some of their opponents -- as a way to break the deadlock . \nBut it carries high risks for the Assad dynasty , as well as the opposition . \n`` This is a dangerous strategy for a regime trying to survive , '' said Eugene Rogan , director of the Middle East Centre at Oxford University . \n`` You watch your army disintegrate if sectarianism becomes an issue . '' \nAnalysts say the Homs killings were provoked by a ferocious security clampdown , including the arrest , disappearance and torture to death of hundreds of men . \nIslamists , long persecuted by the security forces , have their own axe to grind . \n`` The security solution has n't worked . \nThe regime has decided to go for civil strife because it senses that it is losing . \nThe protests are spilling over and spreading to the capital , '' said a Damascus-based Arab journalist who declined to be named . \nAlawite villagers say authorities have been arming young men to fight the insurgency . \nMutilated bodies of some Shabbiha men , handed over by security forces to their families for burial , served to incite sectarian hatred in those villages . \nSectarian paranoia is evident , with Assad trusting only two elite units commanded by his brother Maher -- the 4th Armoured Division and the Republican Guard -- as well as secret police and Alawite militia , known as Shabbiha , to deal with dissent . \n`` The coherence -LRB- of the security forces -RRB- is already in question . \nSectarianism is already a problem , the loyalty of other units can not be counted on , '' Rogan said . \nWhile the authorities blame the upheaval on a `` bunch of Islamists , '' the reality appears more complex . \nSome Syria-watchers say the protest movement is driven mainly by youths and includes rural Sunni tribes , nationalists , leftists , secularists and also Islamists , united in their goal of overthrowing an autocratic and corrupt government . \nGeographically , the protests have spread since March to many rural and tribal regions , cities such as Hama and Homs , and even to Damascus , although not on a huge scale in the capital . \nSecurity forces and Shabbiha militiamen , armed with metal bars , are everywhere . \nThe army has deployed tanks around the main cities to keep out protesters from the countryside . \n`` The savagery of the regime has increased 180 degrees . \nThe hostility against it has massively increased too among ordinary people , not just protesters . \nThere are widescale arrests in all areas , in cities and villages , '' the Syrian journalist said . \nResidents said the Alawite units , though overstretched , have stepped up their offensive and are showing resilience in facing the growing demonstrations . \nThe protest movement , however , is growing and showing no sign of dying down , residents add . \nIn a country where once no one dared utter a word against the president , chants such as : `` Bashar you butcher we wo n't rest until we bury you '' show how fearless the activists have become . \nGraffiti on rubbish bins read : `` Bashar : this is your final grave . '' \nToppling the system , analysts say , is hazardous because of Syria 's power structure under which Alawites hold key posts in the military and Assad family insiders run the key security bodies , tying senior officers closely to Assad 's own fate . \nSarkis Naoum , an expert on Syrian affairs , said Assad was not likely to be overthrown quickly , but the conflict could develop into a bloody civil war . \n`` It is not clear how it would evolve and how much time it would take . \nThe regime can not win and also the opposition can not win either , '' said Naoum , a columnist at Beirut 's an-Nahar daily . \nWhat complicates the Syrian scene is that the Assads will fight to the end rather than leave because they fear that their family and their sect would be targeted under Sunni rule . \n`` The Assads wo n't relinquish power . \nThey are refusing reform because it will make them have to give up power , '' Naoum said . \nRogan said that Assad 's departure was not imminent . \n`` It is a long way before we reach the point where Bashar has to go . \nThe regime is a lot stronger than people like to think but Assad is weak and has no sense of leadership . '' \nThe protests have virtually crippled Damascus . \nShops open for a few hours during the day and close early . \nBusiness activity is grounded and many people have lost their jobs . \nThe city , which once buzzed with night life , is tense and eerie after dark . \nSigns of stretched resources and a strained economy are very evident . \nThe Syrian economy could prove to be Assad 's curse . \nWith no end in sight to the crackdown on protesters , the country 's key revenue streams look shattered . \nA more marked decline in Syria 's economic health may force the regime to fall . \nAfter growing at an average of 5 percent over the last five years , the economy is forecast to contract as much as 3 percent this year as tourism , which accounts for 23 percent of Syria 's hard currency earnings , and foreign investment grind to a halt . \nWith hotels almost empty and the growing likelihood of oil sanctions , Syria is desperately trying to retain local and foreign currency by increasing interest rates on deposits and curbing foreign currency sales . \nTehran , which regards Syria as a close ally in a mainly Sunni-dominated region suspicious of non-Arab Shi'ite Iran , is reported to have come to his help in funds and expertise . \nIran is considering offering $ 5.8 billion -LRB- 3.5 billion pound -RRB- in financial help , French business newspaper Les Echos said . \nIran , which quashed its own pro-democracy youth movement after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re-election in 2009 , has sent experts to help the Syrian authorities monitor and jam satellite communication and the Internet , according to Ausama Monajed of the Syrian opposition . \nThe opposition said the government had been finding it hard to monitor the activists ' communications until the Iranians stepped in , providing authorities with Chinese and North Korean equipment to intercept and eavesdrop on conversations . \nMonajed , spokesman for the Syrian opposition in Europe , said the opposition is lobbying to raise funds and rally world opinion to slap more sanctions against Assad and his aides . \nWhile close observers of Syria weigh the multiple scenarios , none of them appears to have a neat end . \n`` The sooner this mafia is gone the better , '' Rogan said . \n`` A lot worse can happen trying to get rid of these guys than we have seen already . '' \nSeale said : `` The more blood is spilt the more difficult is to find a solution . \nThere has to be a negotiated solution of sort . \nIf there is no solution there will be a civil war .

{"txt": "Karl Rove with George Bush . \nPhotograph : Ron Edmonds\\/AP White House adviser Karl Rove told a grand jury that he discussed with journalists the identity of an outed CIA operative whose public identification has caused a political storm , US media reported today . \nThe Republican told the grand jury in Washington that he had learned of Ms Wilson 's identity from the Washington Post 's Stephen Novak , who told him he planned to report in a weekend column that Ms Wilson had worked for the CIA . \nBoth AP and the New York Times quoted a person briefed on Mr Rove 's grand jury testimony as the source of their stories . \nThe grand jury is investigating the outing of Valerie Wilson , a CIA operative and the wife of Iraq war critic Joseph Wilson . \nMs Wilson , who has been referred to as Valerie Plame in many media reports , was named in a July 2003 article by Mr Novak . \nIn the article , Mr Novak cited two senior administration officials as the source of his story . \nIt is a federal offence in some circumstances to reveal the identity of CIA operative , and the article sparked a justice department investigation to find out who had leaked Ms Wilson 's name to journalists . \nThe investigation has ensnared presidential aides and reporters in a two-year legal battle . \nThe story has also erupted into a political scandal for the US president , George Bush , as Mr Rove is a key adviser and the brains behind Mr Bush 's presidential campaigns . \nDemocrats have claimed that the Bush administration was attempting to punish Mr Wilson through his wife in retaliation for Mr Wilson 's public condemnation of faulty intelligence used to justify an attack on Iraq . \nOn 6 July 2003 , Mr Wilson wrote a New York Times article criticising the White House for including the allegation that Iraq was attempting to buy nuclear material from the Africa in Mr Bush 's state of the union address . \nMr Wilson had himself traveled to Niger at the request of the CIA and found that claims Iraq was trying to buy uranium yellowcake from the African country were false . \nMr Rove told the grand jury in testimony last year that he specifically remembered Mr Novak telling him that Ms Wilson worked for the CIA , AP reported its source , identified only as a person working in the legal profession , as saying . \nMr Rove told the grand jury that by the time Mr Novak had called him , he believes he had similar information about Mr Wilson 's wife from another reporter but had no recollection of which reporter had told him about it first , the source said . \nMr Rove testified that Mr Novak originally called him days before Ms Wilson 's identity was revealed in July 2003 to discuss another story . \nThe conversation eventually turned to former ambassador Joseph Wilson , who was strongly criticising the Bush administration 's Iraq war policy and the intelligence it used to justify the war , the source said . \nAccording to Mr Rove 's testimony , Mr Novak told him he had learned and planned to report in a weekend column that Mr Wilson 's wife had worked for the CIA , and the circumstances on how her husband traveled to Africa to check bogus claims of alleged nuclear material sales to Iraq . \nAnother journalist , Time reporter Matt Cooper , identified Mr Rove to the grand jury earlier this week as the source for his story regarding Ms Wilson . \nMr Cooper refused to `` scoop '' himself by discussing precisely what Mr Rove told him before he can publish his story on the pages of Time . \nMr Rove told the grand jury that four days later , he had a phone conversation with Mr Cooper and - in an effort to discredit some of Mr Wilson 's allegations - told Mr Cooper that Mr Wilson 's wife worked for the CIA , though he never used her name . \nA third reporter , New York Times staffer Judith Miller , is also believed to have known Ms Wilson 's identity . \nShe is currently serving a prison sentence for contempt , after refusing to betray a journalistic confidence and testify about her source before the grand jury . \nMr Novak has refused to discuss his sources or his involvement in the investigation . \nYesterday the senate Democratic leader , Harry Reid , pressed for legislation to strip Mr Rove of his clearance for classified information , which he said Mr Bush should already have done . \nInstead , Mr Reid said , the Bush administration has attacked its critics : `` This is what is known as a cover-up . \nThis is an abuse of power . '' \nThe senate majority leader , Bill Frist , a Republican , said Democrats were resorting to `` partisan war chants '' . \nIn the house of representatives , Rush Holt , a Democrat , introduced legislation for an investigation that would compel senior administration officials to turn over records relating to the Plame disclosure . \nMr Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , said yesterday that his client had testified truthfully to the grand jury and expected to be exonerated . \n`` Karl provided all pertinent information to prosecutors a long time ago , '' Mr Luskin said . \n`` And prosecutors confirmed when he testified most recently in October 2004 that he is not a target of the investigation .

{"txt": "MESA , Ariz. , Feb. 18 -- President Obama unveiled a foreclosure-prevention package Wednesday that would pour more than $ 75 billion into arresting one of the root causes of the nation 's economic spiral by helping as many as 9 million homeowners obtain more affordable mortgage terms . \nThe package , part of the Obama administration 's multibillion-dollar effort to jolt the nation out of its deepening recession , goes beyond what some analysts had expected and was welcomed by many of the nation 's top lending institutions . \nBut it also drew criticism from some housing experts and consumer advocates , who argued that it does not go far enough in addressing some critical aspects of the foreclosure crisis . \nMany key details of the plan will not be released until early next month . \nSpeaking to a crowd packed into a high school gymnasium here , Obama said the mortgage plan would help all Americans confronted with rapidly eroding property values by helping those in danger of losing their homes . \n`` The plan I 'm announcing focuses on rescuing families who have played by the rules and acted responsibly , by refinancing loans for millions of families in traditional mortgages who are underwater or close to it , '' he said . \nThe three key elements of the proposal include a program that would allow 4 million to 5 million homeowners with little equity in their homes to refinance into cheaper mortgages ; a $ 75 billion program to keep 3 million to 4 million homeowners out of foreclosure ; and a doubling of the government 's commitment to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to $ 400 billion . \nIt is the largest federal foreclosure-prevention package in decades , and it would rely on a series of incentives to jump-start fledgling efforts to keep millions of distressed borrowers in their homes . \nIt is the first major government program aimed at homeowners who are current on their loans , and it would require large banks that have received government bailout money to abide by industry standards for loan modifications established by the Obama administration . \nAbout one in 10 homeowners were delinquent on their mortgages late last year , and as many as 6 million homes could go into foreclosure during the next three years without this program , said Shaun Donovan , secretary of housing and urban development , adding : `` We believe we can help a very large share of these . '' \nThe administration estimates that simply by reducing foreclosures , the plan could stop the slide in home prices by as much as $ 6,000 per property . \n`` The effects of this crisis have also reverberated across the financial markets . \nWhen the housing market collapsed , so did the availability of credit on which our economy depends , '' Obama said . \n`` As that credit has dried up , it has been harder for families to find affordable loans to purchase a car or pay tuition , and harder for businesses to secure the capital they need to expand and create jobs . '' \nWhile some of the measures Obama announced can be implemented by government regulators , others will require congressional approval . \nFor example , a key part of the package includes legislation that would bankruptcy law to allow judges to modify the mortgages of distressed homeowners , including by reducing the principal of the loan to the property 's current market value . \nWhile broad , the package does not tackle some key issues , critics said , noting that it does not include a plan for dealing with second mortgages , which often become a stumbling block for mortgage-modification programs . \nOthers pointed out that for many lenders , the program would be voluntary . \n`` This is a major step forward to addressing the foreclosure crisis , '' said John Taylor , president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition . \n`` But the plan may not be aggressive enough . \nWhile the plan offers sweeteners to encourage lenders and homeowners to participate , its voluntary nature may blunt its impact .

'' \nDr Murray did not give evidence during his six-week trial , which ended on Monday when a jury ruled he had given Jackson a fatal overdose of propofol . \nHe spoke to journalist Steve Hewlett eight days before the verdict as part of a documentary called The Man Who Killed Michael Jackson . \nThe pop star 's family have complained about the program , which is due to be screened in the US next week . \nunder the title Michael Jackson and the Doctor : A Fatal Friendship . \nThe executors of the pop star 's estate said Murray was getting a primetime platform to smear Jackson 's reputation without fear of cross-examination , and demanded that the screening be canceled . \n`` Like so many of Michael 's fans , the estate is ... disgusted by MSNBC 's irresponsible and inexplicable decision to air a Conrad Murray ` documentary ' , '' it said . \nAsked about Jackson 's use of propofol , Dr Murray said : `` I did not recommend it . \nI would never have recommended propofol to Mr Jackson '' . \n`` He needed to get rid of it and resume a more normal state of sleep . '' \nUsing an analogy to explain his actions , he told Mr Hewlett : `` If I came to your house and you were a friend of mine and unexpectedly I saw you with a gun in your hand , I can do one of two things and maybe succeed . \n`` I can tell you stop it and you might listen to me , or I might take hours to get you to hand over that gun . \nSo I would say , basically , it took me a while to take away from Michael something I thought he should not use . '' \nDescribing the night when Jackson died , Dr Murray accounted for his actions in the one hour and 40 minutes between administering propofol and the emergency services being called . \nHe said he had sat with Jackson , checking his vital signs until he believed the effects of the sedative had worn off , before moving to an adjacent room at 11:20 am . \n`` If you say : ` Dr Murray , that was really stupid , you should have had a look , ' then I agree , '' he said . \nDr Murray added that he had not informed police or the ambulance crew that Jackson had taken the drug because `` they never asked me '' and `` I did not think it was important '' . \nThe prosecution said Murray had caused Jackson 's death through negligence His comments echoed a similar interview given to the US breakfast television show Today earlier this week . \n`` I think propofol is not recommended to be given in the home setting , '' Dr Murray said during the interview . \n`` But it is not contraindicated . '' \nIn court , the defense argued that Jackson was a drug addict who caused his own death by giving himself an extra dose of propofol while the cardiologist was out of the room at the star 's rented Los Angeles mansion . \nMurray told Today 's Savannah Guthrie he had not been distracted by phone calls , emails and text messages . \n`` When I looked at a man who was all night deprived of sleep , who was desperate for sleep and finally is getting some sleep , am I gonna sit over him , sit around him , tug on his feet , do anything unusual to wake him up ? \nNo , '' Murray said . \nAsked if he was right to leave Jackson alone , he replied : `` Had I known what I know today in retrospect , that Mr Jackson was an addict - and he had shared that information with me - addicts may behave in a way that is unreasonable and you may consider it .

{"txt": "BP is trying to funnel the leaking oil to the surface The deadly blast on board an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico was caused by an exploding bubble of methane gas , according to a US media report . \nWorkers on the rig described hearing `` screaming and hollering '' and said people leapt into the sea to escape . \nThe accounts came from a BP report into last month 's blast , which has led to thousands of barrels of oil leaking . \nEye-witnesses also said that safety mechanisms did not function and that workers were taken by surprise . \nThe fresh details about the blast were revealed in interviews with oil rig workers carried out by BP during an internal investigation , Associated Press reports . \nThe revelations came as a giant funnel was lowered over the oil well in a bid to contain oil leaking from it . \nBP said it might take up to 12 hours for the steel-and-concrete containment device to settle in place , but that everything appeared to be going as planned . \nIt is hoped it will be able to collect as much as 85 % of the leaking oil and begin funnelling it to ships above by Monday . \nOil from a slick caused by the leak has washed ashore on islands off Louisiana . \nFresh details about the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig emerged on Friday . \nOne worker rescued from the rig , Micah Sandell , reportedly said : `` There was people screaming and hollering . \nThere was people jumping off the side . \nI 've never seen nothing like that . \nAnother , Dwayne Martinez , said : `` Everybody was scared to death . \nNothing went as planned like it was supposed to . '' \nMr Martinez continued : `` No kind of alarms . \nWe did n't hear any kind of alarms until there was one explosion . '' \nThe accounts , from BP 's own investigations into the blast last month , describe how the blow-out was triggered by a bubble of methane gas that escaped from the well and shot up the drill column , AP reports . \nIt rapidly expanded as it burst through several seals and barriers before exploding , the documents say . \nDetails of the documents were revealed by Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor , who has worked for BP as a risk assessment consultant . \nBP spokesman John Curry would not comment on the events described in the internal documents . \n`` We anticipate all the facts will come out in a full investigation , '' he said . \nUS officials announced on Friday that they had closed Breton National Wildlife Refuge to the public after a silver sheen of oil reached the shoreline . \n`` The refuge closure is important to keep the public safe , to minimize disturbance to nesting colonial sea birds , and to allow personnel conducting cleanup operations and recovery efforts to work safely and efficiently , '' the US Fish and Wildlife Service said on Friday . \nThe BBC 's Rajesh Mirchandani , on Dauphin Island , an inhabited barrier island three miles -LRB- 5km -RRB- off the coast of Alabama , says there is a faint but distinct smell of oil in the air . \nSome scientists say the oil may be spread more widely . \nSmall , black particles have been found in samples taken from below the surface , away from the visible slick , our correspondent adds . \nAn estimated 5,000 barrels of oil a day has been leaking for 18 days from the well , 50 miles off Louisiana , since an explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig last month , killing 11 workers . \nAlthough the rig was operated by Transocean , it was leased by BP , which is responsible for cleaning the 3 million gallons that have so far leaked , creating a slick covering about 2,000 sq miles -LRB- 5,200 sq km -RRB- . \nThe company hopes the 98-tonne containment device , once operational , will allow it to collect oil leaking out of the well while it attempts to stop the leak altogether by drilling relief wells nearby . \nHOW THE OIL FUNNEL WORKS The funnel is a 40ft tall iron box , weighing 98 tonnes It will be placed over the leak , 5,000 ft down on the seabed BP hopes it will collect 85 % of the leaking oil and pipe it to the surface Earlier , remote-controlled submersibles guided the 40ft -LRB- 12m -RRB- funnel above the wellhead , some 5,000 ft below the surface . \nThe technology has only ever been used in shallow waters . \n`` It appears to be going exactly as we hoped , '' BP spokesman Bill Salvin told the Associated Press . \n`` Still lots of challenges ahead , but this is very good progress . '' \nNow that the containment device is on the seafloor , workers will need at least 12 hours to let it settle and make sure it is stable before the submersibles can hook up a pipe and hose that will funnel the oil up to a tanker . \n`` We are essentially taking a four-story building and lowering it 5,000 ft and setting it on the head of a pin , '' Mr Salvin added . \nIf the box works , another will be dropped onto a second , smaller leak . \nExperts warn that there is still a risk that any wrong move could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . \nIt is also possible for the pipe to the surface to become clogged with ice , and for the subsequent separation of the oil , gas and water to cause an explosion . \nFears are growing for the safety of the area 's manifest wildlife In the meantime , residents of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida await news of when the oil will reach their shores . \nBP said emergency teams had been sent to Freemason Island , a favorite fishing spot for recreational anglers some 30 miles off Louisiana 's coast , to deploy inflatable booms to protect its prime marshland . \nFears are growing that sea life may have been severely affected in the area , which includes vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs . \nThe attempt by BP to lower the funnel comes as Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar called for a halt to permits for new exploratory drilling in the US , pending a 30-day investigation into the cause of the oil spill . \nSome environmentalists are now calling for a permanent ban on offshore drilling as a result of the spill .

{"txt": "Minute-by-minute timeline in BP report points to series of terrible failures leading to biggest offshore oil spill in history Wednesday 8 September 2010 16.40 BST An oil worker 's hard hat lies in oil from the BP spill on East Grand Terre Island , Louisiana . \nBP 's report today attempts to spread the blame for the disaster . \nPhotograph : Lee Celano\\/Reuters `` The well is blowing out ... -LRB- one of the technicians -RRB- is shutting it in now . '' \nThat call was made aboard the Deepwater oil rig at 21.45 on 20 April , but was fatally optimistic . \nThe rig was plunged into darkness as all power was lost and a huge explosion hit the rig 10 seconds later . \n`` One of the technicians -LRB- one of the technicians -RRB- is shutting it in now , '' Macondo said . \nThe `` nightmare well '' , as it had been dubbed by some workers , had become a real world horror . \nThe minute-by-minute timeline in the report released by BP today , along with the astonishing catalogue of errors and failures the report details , paints a vivid picture of both the terror of that night on the rig and the extraordinary lapses in safety . \nThe catastrophe , which led to the spilling of five million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , began some time before 19.55 local time , deep below the sea . \nOil and gas started forcing its way into the well bore , breaching a cement barrier . \nWithout naming the cement contractor , Halliburton , the BP investigators made their opinion clear : `` There were weaknesses in cement design and testing , quality assurance and risk assessment . '' \nTwo further barriers , in the so-called `` shoe track '' at the base of the well , then failed as the intense pressure of the hydrocarbons came to bear on them . \nNext came perhaps the most crucial mistake . \nPressure readings were taken on the well to determine whether it was under control , but despite `` anomalies '' the test was considered `` good '' . \nBP 's report accepts some of the responsibility but also blames the Transocean rig crew for reaching the `` incorrect view that the test was successful '' . \nThat was at 19.55 , and all must have seemed well on the rig , but below their feet the storm was gathering . \nThe report estimates that at 21.38 , hydrocarbons burst through the well and into the riser , the pipe leading up to the rig . \nWithin three minutes , mud had shot up through the derrick on the rig , the first warning blast , and from here events unfolded at breakneck speed . \nAs the mud spurted , a valve was closed diverting the flow to a device that separated mud from gas - another crucial mistake . \nThis brought the full force of the blown well directly onto the rig , rather than venting it overboard . \nAt 21.45 , as mud was `` raining down on the deck '' and the well pressure was trebling , the call was made to shut the well . \nIn the following minutes , high pressure gas was discharging towards the deck , vibrating the huge rig . \nThe sirens of one gas alarm after another went off , and the drill pipe pressure rose another fivefold . \nBy 21.49 , just four minutes after the call to shut the well was made , the rig was plunged into darkness as all power was lost . \nThe darkness of the Gulf night lasted just five seconds . \nA huge explosion hit the rig followed by another one 10 seconds later . \nThe fate of Deepwater , and the biggest offshore oil spill in history , was set . \nThose four minutes contained another series of terrible failures . \nThe bursting of gas and oil into the wellbore pushed up pressure readings 40 minutes earlier , but it was 40 minutes before any action was taken . \nOnce again , the BP report blames the rig crew - Transocean . \nNext was the decision to route the flow of the hydrocarbons onto the rig , to the mud gas separator . \nWithout that decision , `` there may have been more time to respond , and the consequences of the accident may have been reduced '' says the BP report . \nThe onslaught of hydrocarbons overwhelmed the separator and allowed them to burst into parts of the rig that were not designed to suppress electrical sparks , via the heating , ventilation and air-conditioning systems , with explosive consequences . \nAt 21.52 , the Mayday call went out , as the rig crew tried to ensure the blowout preventer - the 450-tonne set of valves on the sea floor and the ultimate failsafe - was in operation . \nAs they did , 115 people began to leave the rig by a nearby ship . \nThe coastguard were at the rig by 23.22 . \nEleven hours later the rig sank and oil began to pour into the gulf . \nThe failure of the blowout preventer was the final , catastrophic lapse . \nBP 's report found that the explosions and fire on the rig very likely disabled the `` emergency disconnect sequence '' , the primary emergency response that was supposed the seal the well . \nAn automatic system , meant to kick in if power from the rig was lost , also failed , for the prosaic and appalling reason that the batteries in one control pod were flat and a crucial valve in the other was faulty . \nTwo days later , the Macondo well delivered the final insult . \nRobot submarines had made it to the seabed and operated the shear valve that was meant to seal the well . \nTransocean 's response to BP 's report has been scathing : `` This is a self-serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident : BP 's fatally flawed well design . \nIn both its design and construction , BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk in some cases , severely . '' \nStephen Davis was on board Deepwater and told the Guardian in May about his memory of that night of chaos : the sensation of being flung five metres into a wall by a powerful explosion , the desperate , muddy scramble on a deck lit only by the reflections from a huge pillar of flame ; the look in men 's eyes before they jumped 18 metres -LRB- 60ft -RRB- into the water . \n`` You could taste the fumes , that godawful taste in your mouth . \nIt was hard to breathe . \nThe oxygen was being sucked out of the living quarters . \nThen all of a sudden just boom . \nIt was the biggest explosion I ever heard in my life .

{"txt": "BEIRUT | Sat Aug 27 , 2011 8:46 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi by Libyan rebels supported by NATO forces focuses international attention on the five months of unrest in Syria , which has shaken one of the most tightly controlled Arab states . \nOpposition figures and activists fear the successful use of force to topple Gaddafi may encourage Syrians to follow Libya 's example . \nSyria 's fate is far more uncertain than the fate of Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi . \nUpheaval in Syria would affect its allies and enemies in the volatile Middle East , and a softening in rhetoric from Arab countries this week indicated they might still be prepared to support President Bashar al-Assad if he implements reform . \nFollowing are some possible scenarios in Syria and the risks and opportunities they would present : The United Nations says 2,200 people have been killed in Assad 's crackdown on dissent since protests broke out in March . \nSyria says over 500 soldiers and police have been killed by armed groups which it blames for the violence . \nDespite growing international condemnation , Western sanctions , and escalating economic pressures from the unrest , Assad 's rule shows no sign of imminent collapse . \nNor is there any indication that the protests across the country are about to stop , although the number of protesters appears to have fallen since Assad sent troops into several major cities earlier in August . \nIf Assad can not crush the protests completely , he may be able to contain their impact , staying in power despite the major upheaval and economic disruption caused by the unrest and growing international isolation . \nSTRIKING A DEAL WITH OPPOSITION Assad could reshuffle his ministers and bring in some opposition figures in a symbolic move that will not stop street demonstrations but may convince some that he is serious about reforms , including the promise of multi-party elections by February . \nAfter an apparently coordinated wave of criticism from regional powers including Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Turkey earlier this month , Arab states have moderated their language in recent days , hinting at a possible easing of pressure on Assad . \nMany opposition figures have dismissed Assad 's promise of political reform and said they can not talk to the authorities while the violence continues . \nBut if the deadlock continues , some members of the fractured opposition may feel there is no alternative to negotiation , despite the chasm of mistrust between the two sides . \nSo far no country has proposed carrying out in Syria the kind of intervention undertaken by NATO forces to help Libyan rebels topple Muammar Gaddafi . \nBut the collapse of Gaddafi 's rule has encouraged some Syrian opposition figures and protesters to support international intervention in Syria , including the idea of a Turkish buffer zone in northern Syria . \nNATO help us , '' read one banner , in English , at a protest in the northern province of Idlib on Friday . \nBut any military intervention could destabilize a region in which Assad enjoys strong support from Iran and backs militant groups like Hezbollah , Hamas and Islamic Jihad . \n`` Any negative or bad development will affect the whole region , '' Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Friday . \nInternational intervention could also lead some Syrians to choose Assad over perceived foreign interference . \nAnalysts and some opposition activists have warned that the continuous killing may encourage people to take up arms in big numbers , pushing the country toward civil war . \n`` I fear that some in the opposition who are in a hurry to end the regime , who we have always warned against repeating the Libyan example , will say now it has been successful and resort to arms , '' said opposition figure Louay Hussein . \nAssad belongs to the minority Alawite sect which makes up around ten percent of the Syrian population . \nMost of the demonstrations are taking place in Sunni Muslim areas . \nThere have been sectarian killings in some cities including Homs , but activists say so far it has been a minor part of the unrest . \nSyria suffered repeated coups in the 1960s before Assad 's father , Hafez al-Assad , seized power in 1970 and purged his opponents from positions of power . \nDespite reports of some low-level defections , and Assad 's replacement of his defense minister at the height of the military crackdown in August , the army has so far stood behind the president , unlike in the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions . \nBut some activists see little prospect of Assad being toppled by street demonstrations and see a military coup as the best chance of removing him . \nThey hope Western calls for Assad to step down and targeted sanctions against senior officials might encourage those around the president to break away or carry out a coup to avoid prosecution . \nIt is not clear how any new military leaders would deal with protesters ' demands for greater political freedoms . \nAttention has also focused on the wealthy merchant classes of Damascus and Aleppo which have made no public move yet to disassociate themselves from Assad . \nUnless they feel their interests would be protected in a post-Assad Syria , they would be reluctant to push for revolutionary change . \nBut their patience may be tested as the economy reels from the collapse of tourism revenues and foreign investment , loss of trade and a fall in manufacturing output . \nAn ultra-low

{"txt": "By Jonathan Marcus BBC Diplomatic Correspondent Syria 's Kurdish activists have begun to take control of towns near the border with Turkey In any assessment of the potential winners and losers from the political chaos in Syria , the country 's Kurdish minority could be among the winners . \nThe Kurds make up a little over 10 % of the population . \nThey have begun to take control of towns near the border with Turkey and have made headway in the United States and in the West , where they proved their loyalty and lack of religious extremism . \nAaron David Miller , a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington DC , believes that the Kurds could be one of the main beneficiaries of the demise of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad . \n`` Syria is coming apart , and there 's not much chance it will be reassembled with the kind of centralised authority we saw under the Assads . '' \nFor the Syrian Kurds , whom he describes as `` part of the largest single ethnic grouping in the region that lacks a state '' , there is `` an opportunity to create more autonomy and respect for Kurdish rights '' . \n`` They have the motivation , opportunity , and their Kurdish allies in Iraq and Turkey to encourage them . \nBut what will hold them back is Turkey 's determination to prevent a mini-statelet in Syria along with the Kurds own internal divisions , '' he says . \nThe Kurdish factor in the Syrian crisis will prove to be as significant as the Kurdish question in Iraq '' End Quote Prof Fawaz Gerges London School of Economics `` It is unlikely , '' he believes , `` that Syria 's Kurds will be able to establish a separate entity in Syria . \nNor will the United States , nor the international community accept that . '' \n`` At the same time , the several dimensions of the Kurdish problem - the Iraqi Kurds ' growing determination to remain a separate entity ; Turkish determination to avoid another mini-Kurdistan along the Syrian-Iraqi border ; and the issue of the PKK , the armed Kurdish insurgents fighting the Turkish Army - will create a real flashpoint . '' \nThere in a nutshell is the scale of the problem . \nThe Kurds ' future in Syria will have an important bearing upon what sort of country it is going to become . \nBut the fate of the Syrian Kurds also has ramifications well beyond the country 's borders . \nThese processes are already under way . \nFawaz Gerges , professor of Middle Eastern Politics at the London School of Economics , told me that `` the Syrian Kurds have already seized the moment and are laying the foundation for an autonomous region like their counterparts in Iraq '' . \n`` The exit of Assad 's forces from the Kurdish areas has complicated the crisis and deepened Turkey 's fears that its borders with Iraq and Syria will be volatile for years to come , '' he says . \nTurkey has accused Syria of encouraging rebels from the Kurdistan Worker Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- `` The Kurdish factor in the Syrian crisis will prove to be as significant as the Kurdish question in Iraq . '' \nProf Ofra Bengio , head of the Kurdish Studies program at the Moshe Dayan Centre at Tel Aviv University , agrees . \n`` The Kurdish dimension is likely to become a potent factor in the near future because of the weakening of each of the states in which they live , because co-operation among the states for curbing the Kurds is non-existent , and because the Kurds have made headway in the United States and in the West , where they proved their loyalty and lack of religious extremism . \n`` In a word , the West might like to support them . '' \nIf a Kurdish spectre is stalking the region then it is probably Turkey that has most reason to be worried . \nEven as Ankara has watched developments in Syria with unease , its own struggle with guerrilla fighters of the Kurdish PKK -LRB- designated a terrorist organization by Turkey , the EU and the US -RRB- has flared up again . \nTurkey 's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davotoglu has insisted that the Syrian government is encouraging the PKK , to get its own back for Turkey 's insistence that President Assad must go . \nBut it is even more complicated than this . \nThe dominant Kurdish faction inside Syria is a close ally - some say even an off-shoot - of the PKK . \nIt has little love for the mainstream Syrian opposition championed by the Turks . \nWhilst fighting the PKK on one front , Turkey is desperately trying to curb the political ambitions of Syria 's Kurds by political means . \nIndeed the ramifications of the Kurdish issue go even further . \nProf Gerges insists that the Kurdish question `` is here to stay '' . \n`` It transcends national borders and has the potential to redraw the Sykes-Pico agreement , which , after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 , established existing nation-state boundaries . \nKurds in Syria have long complained of discrimination by the government `` Although it is too early to talk about the emergence of a greater Kurdistan , an imagined community of Kurds resonates deeply among Kurds across Turkey , Iraq , Syria and Iran . '' \nIt is in this sense the upheavals associated with the `` Arab Spring '' take on their full regional significance . \nThe Sykes-Picot Agreement -LRB- named not surprisingly after the two negotiators , Mr Georges Picot and Sir Mark Sykes -RRB- was a secret understanding made between France and Britain in 1916 for the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire . \nThe agreement led to the division of Turkish-held areas of the Levant into various French and British administered territories which eventually gave rise to the modern-day states of Syria , Lebanon , Iraq and ultimately Israel . \nMany Syrian Kurds have fled to Iraqi Kurdistan to escape the violence Fawaz Gerges asserts that the events in Syria and their potential repercussions risk over-turning this familiar world ; a broader re-ordering of the region in which Kurdish aspirations are just one part of a very complex picture . \n`` Many of the problems in the contemporary Middle East are traced to that colonial-era Sykes-Picot map , which established the state system in the region . \nThe Palestine and Kurdish questions are cases in point . '' \n`` National borders do not correspond to imagined communities . \nAlthough the state system has established deep roots in the Middle East in the last nine decades , the current uprisings have starkly exposed the fragility of the colonial system imposed on the region . \n`` My take is that the great powers , together with their local partners , will fight tooth and nail to prevent the redrawing of the borders of the state system in the Middle East . \n`` For once the map is re-drawn , where would the limits be ? \nThere would be a real danger of perpetual instability and conflict , '' he says . \nThe Kurds of Syria , of course , are not in quite the same position as their brothers in Iraq and would find it much harder to break away . \nIn the back of the president 's mind , there may be the thought that empowering the Kurds is a way of weakening the Sunni Arab majority '' End Quote Joshua Landis Syrian expert Noted Syria expert Joshua Landis of the University of Oklahoma says that while Syria 's Kurds are a compact minority they are not a majority even in the north eastern border area with Turkey - where they constitute some 30-40 % of the population . \nThey have sometimes tense relations with local Sunni Arab tribes who see this as an integral part of Syrian territory , reinforced by the fact that this is an area rich in oil resources vital to the Syrian economy . \nProf Landis argues that what is going on in the Kurdish north-east offers a useful pointer to President Assad 's `` Plan B '' should his control over key cities like Damascus and Aleppo crumble . \nHe says that the `` embattled president withdrew government forces from the north-east because he could n't control it and wanted to focus on the most important battles in Aleppo and Damascus '' . \n`` But in the back of the president 's mind , there may be the thought that empowering the Kurds is a way of weakening the Sunni Arab majority and underlining the risks of fragmentation should his government fall . \nIt 's a strategy of playing upon divisions to sow chaos , '' he said . \nThis way , says Prof Landis , `` the Syrian Army - which is rapidly becoming an Alawite militia , whilst still the strongest military force - may lose control over large swathes of the country , but will remain a vital factor in determining the political outcome in Syria '' . \nIt is a bleak prospect . \nProf Landis asserts that President Assad `` may lose Syria , but could still remain a player , and his Alawite minority will not be destroyed '' . \n`` That 's the future of Syria , '' he says , with little enthusiasm . \n`` It 's what Lebanon was and what Iraq became . '' \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .

{"txt": "April 26 : Weathered oil is seen on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico near the coast of Louisiana . \nAP Apr. 21 : An oil slick is seen as the Deepwater Horizon oil rig burns in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAP BILOXI , Mississippi -- This time , it 's not a hurricane that threatens to wreck their livelihoods -- it 's a blob of black ooze slowly making its way toward the Gulf Coast . \nHotel owners , fishermen and restaurateurs are keeping anxious watch as an oil slick spreads from a wrecked drilling rig site like a giant filthy ink blot . \nForecasters say it could wash ashore within days near delicate wetlands , oyster beds and pristine white beaches . \nCrews have not been able to stop thousands of barrels of oil from spewing out of the sea floor since an April 20 explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon , which was drilling 50 miles off the Louisiana coast . \nEleven workers are missing and presumed dead , and the cause of the explosion has not been determined . \nLouis Skrmetta , 54 , runs a company called Ship Island Excursions that takes tourists to the Gulf Islands National Seashore , where white-sand beaches and green water create an idyllic landscape . \n`` This is the worst possible thing that could happen to the Mississippi Gulf Coast , '' he said . \n`` It will wipe out the oyster industry . \nShrimping would n't recover for years . \nIt would kill family tourism . \nThat 's our livelihood . '' \nAs crews struggled to contain the oil slick , Coast Guard officials said Tuesday they were considering setting fire to the contaminated water to burn off the crude . \nPools of oil far offshore would be trapped in special containment booms and set aflame as soon as Wednesday . \n`` If we do n't secure this well , this could be one of the most significant oil spills in U.S. history , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . \nA similar burn off the coast of Newfoundland in 1993 eliminated 50 to 99 percent of captured oil . \nHowever , burning the oil also creates air pollution , and the effect on marine life is unclear . \nEd Overton , a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University who 's studying the oil spill , questioned whether burning would work . \n`` It can be effective in calm water , not much wind , in a protected area , '' he said . \n`` When you 're out in the middle of the ocean , with wave actions , and currents , pushing you around , it 's not easy . '' \nHe has another concern : The oil samples from the spill he 's looked at shows it to be a sticky substance similar to roofing tar . \n`` I 'm not super optimistic . \nThis is tarry crude that lies down in the water , '' he said . \n`` But it 's something that has got to be tried . '' \nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , birds and mammals are more likely to escape a burning area of the ocean than escape from an oil slick . \nThe agency said birds might be disoriented by the plumes of smoke , but they would be at much greater risk from exposure to oil in the water . \nIn Washington , meanwhile , the Obama administration launched a full investigation of the explosion , and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said they will devote every available resource to the probe . \nMeanwhile , the glistening sheen of sweet crude continued to grow and began forming long reddish-orange ribbons of oil that , if they wash up on shore , could cover birds , white sand beaches and marsh grasses . \nThe last major spill in the Gulf was in June 1979 , when an offshore drilling rig in Mexican waters -- the Ixtoc I -- blew up , releasing 140 million gallons of oil . \nIt took until March 1980 to cap the well , and a great deal of the oil contaminated U.S. waters and Texas shores . \n`` In the worst-case scenario , this could also last months , '' said Richard Haut , a senior research scientist at the Houston Advanced Research Center who worked for Exxon for 20 years , 10 of them on an offshore platform in the North Sea . \nOil from the Deepwater Horizon is not expected to reach the coast until late in the week , if at all . \nAs of Tuesday , it was about 20 miles offshore , south of Venice , Louisiana . \nThe spill covered an expanding area about 48 miles long and 80 miles wide , but with uneven borders , making it difficult to calculate its area in square miles . \n`` I understand there 's got to be industry , but it 's so sad for our kids . \nWe do n't have a lot of beaches left , '' Bonnie Bethel , 66 , said as she watched her grandchildren splash in the water on a Mississippi beach . \n`` Can you imagine these poor birds in oil ? '' \nThousands of birds such as egrets and brown pelicans are nesting on barrier islands close to the rig 's wreckage right now . \nIf the oil gets to them , rescuers would need to reach their remote islands , wash them down and release them back into the wild . \nMichael Ziccardi , director of the Oiled Wildlife Care Network affiliated with the University of California at Davis , said he is standing by to clean up Gulf Coast birds if they are hurt by the spill . \nCleaning up brown pelican chicks after a modest spill in Louisiana in 2005 was a major undertaking , he said . \n`` Just about any petroleum can cause problems for birds because they lose their waterproofing , and that 's what keeps them dry and warm , '' Ziccardi said . \n`` It 's a really difficult time , and we 're close to the peak of migration . '' \nThe spill also threatens billions of fish eggs and larvae coating the Gulf 's surface this time of year . \nIf the well can not be closed , almost 100,000 barrels of oil , or 4.2 million gallons , could spill into the Gulf before crews can drill a relief well to alleviate the pressure . \nBy comparison , the Exxon Valdez , the worst oil spill in U.S. history , leaked 11 million gallons into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 . \nCrews working to clean up the spill from the Deepwater Horizon have other things in their favor . \nOil from the Exxon Valdez can still be found under rocks in the cold water of Prince William Sound , but residue in the Gulf will disappear faster . \n`` You have warm temperatures , strong sunlight , microbial action . \nIt will degrade a lot faster , '' said Ronald S. Tjeerdema , an environmental toxicologist at the University of California at Davis who 's studied the effects of oil on aquatic systems . \n`` Eventually , things will return to normal . '' \nAnd there 's another bit of good news : The oil spilling out is sweet crude , which is low in sulfur , unlike the oil from the Exxon Valdez , which was heavy crude . \n`` If you had to pick an oil to spill , this would be it , '' Overton , the LSU oil spill expert , said . \nBP said Tuesday that it planned to begin drilling a relief well to redirect the leaking oil in a $ 100 million effort to take the pressure off the blown-out well . \nThe company said it would begin the drilling by Thursday even if crews can shut off oil leaking from the pipe 5,000 feet underground . \nRobot subs have tried to activate a shut-off device , but so far that has not worked . \nCompany spokesman Robert Wine said the drilling will take up to three months and will be done from a rig now in place near where the Deepwater Horizon sank . \nLouisiana-based BP spokesman Neil Chapman said 49 vessels -- oil skimmers , tugboats barges and special recovery boats that separate oil from water -- are working to round up oil . \nIn Pensacola , Florida , the easternmost point likely to be affected , beachgoers and business owners kept watch . \n`` I 've been looking at this sand all morning and thinking about the oil spill , '' said Shelley Brunson after a morning swim at Pensacola Beach . \n`` I am praying they clean it up fast and it does n't come here . '' \nSal Pinzone , general manager of the fishing pier where anglers catch pompano and cobia , shows up at work at 5:30 every morning to watch the sun rise over the famous white-sand beach . \n`` We are all worried , '' he said . \n`` If the spill does hit the beaches along the Gulf , it will shut down everything .

'' \nSmick built his career through the classic Washington practice of networking and advice-giving , and his analysis is sprinkled with stories of encounters with big players in global finance . \nHe describes his sweaty-palmed interview with Singapore 's legendary leader Lee Kuan Yew , who blasted Smick for his confidence in U.S. markets , then gave him a consulting contract . \nIt 's classic name-dropping , but it enlivens his account . \nSmick views the country 's economic setbacks from the perspective of a committed globalist who fears that Americans will start demanding barriers to trade and investment , provoking an even greater crisis . \nHis book argues that the United States can and must compete in a world with shrinking boundaries because there really is n't another choice . \nBAD MONEY Reckless Finance , Failed Politics , And the Global Crisis of American Capitalism By Kevin Phillips | Viking . \n$ 25.95 Kevin Phillips is alarmed by the increasing gap in wealth between the richest Americans and the rest of the population . \nOther analysts see this trend coming from political choices , the unplanned chaos of global markets and individual avarice . \nPhillips , author of American Dynasty and American Theocracy , spies the shadowy hand of the financial elite pulling the strings . \nAccording to him , since the 1980s , Wall Street and its Washington allies have set out to tie the U.S. economy to the money sector and let manufacturing companies and factory workers fall by the wayside . \n`` The flight of the economy from tangibles to money manipulation is enriching a broad cross section of the upper-echelon institutions and practitioners of U.S. finance , '' he writes . \nHe blames this nefarious plan for the current economic crisis and argues that it dooms the United States to second-class status , behind China . \nThe pitch of Phillips 's alarms has led one reviewer to call him a modern Thomas Paine . \nBut the sweep of his claims creates a big burden of proof that he does n't even attempt to meet . \nIs there a powerful cabal at work to carry out a sinister `` financialization '' of the U.S. economy ? \nPhillips ducks : `` This book will not try to prove or disprove any particular backstage role '' by Wall Street and Washington power brokers . \nHe is `` not interested in becoming a conspiracy investigator , '' he insists . \nBut his work edges closer to Dan Brown 's than he should want . \nOf the four books , Zandi 's account of the internal threats to U.S. prosperity is most clinical while Smick provides a global perspective . \nSoros , who calls himself a `` failed philosopher '' attempts in his tenth book to put this crisis into a complex theoretical context and asks readers to make one more try to grasp it . \nAll four authors agree on the growing vulnerability of American financial well-being . \nAlone among the major economies , the United States is critically dependent on countries that sell us oil , electronics and the things that fill our shopping bags . \nAmericans have stopped saving . \nThe Bush administration and Congress have let budget deficits fly . \nAnd now the country relies on foreigners to plow dollars back in to keep the economy going . \nThe authors warn that this financial dependence , like our energy dependence , is eroding the nation 's choices . \nThese four experts see the credit shock as a probable turning point toward an even tougher future . \nBudget deficits will have to be faced . \nPainful spending decisions on health care and social security must be made . \nThe economy 's rewards must flow more fairly . \n`` Henceforth , American consumers ... have to find ways to live within their means , '' Zandi says . \n`` Their unlimited freedom to spend , as well as their dominant role in the global economy , -LRB- has -RRB- reached an end .

{"txt": "cents BA cabin steward in isolation ward cents Mexico invokes special measures A British Airways cabin steward is being treated in an isolation unit at a London hospital after falling ill on a flight from Mexico , where a killer virus is believed to have caused at least 68 deaths and sparked widespread panic . \nHealth experts say it has the potential to become a global pandemic . \nThe BA steward , who has not been named , was on board a flight from Mexico City to Heathrow Airport last night when he fell ill and was taken to hospital . \nIt is the first suspected case of the new flu strain to be reported in Europe , prompting fears it may have spread across the Atlantic from Mexico . \nThe World Health Organisation says the swine flu strain - a unique mix of human , pig and bird viruses - constituted a public health emergency of international concern . \nTwenty people are known to have died in Mexico so far out of a total of 1,004 reported cases , and 48 more deaths are thought to be attributable to the outbreak . \nAt least nine swine flu cases have been reported in California and Texas . \nThe most recently reported California case , the seventh there , was a 35-year-old woman who was treated in hospital but recovered . \nThe woman , whose illness began in early April , had no known contact with the other cases . \nAt least two more cases have been confirmed in Kansas , bringing the US total to 11 . \nState health officials said yesterday they had confirmed swine flu in a married couple living in the central part of the state after the husband visited Mexico . \nThey have not been hospitalised , and the state described their illnesses as mild . \nDr Jason Eberhart-Phillips , Kansas 's state health officer , said : `` Fortunately , the man and woman understand the gravity of the situation and are very willing to isolate themselves . '' \nAdditionally , at least eight students at a New York high school were last night also believed to have a form of human swine flu , but authorities are not yet certain if it is the same strain that has killed people in Mexico . \nThe 38-year-old BA steward is being kept in Northwick Park hospital in north-west London , which has a specialist ward for patients with suspected tropical and infectious diseases , while doctors carry out swabs and blood tests . \nA Health Protection Agency spokeswoman said : `` We are aware of a patient admitted to a London hospital with reported travel history to Mexico . \nAs a precautionary measure the patient is being tested for a range of respiratory and other illnesses ... At present there have been no confirmed cases of human swine flu in the UK or anywhere in Europe . '' \nThe crew member , who flew out to Mexico on 20 April , is understood to have shown symptoms of fever before embarking yesterday for the return leg to Heathrow . \nHe had been suffering from high temperature , aches and dizziness the night before the return flight but was allowed through health controls at Mexico City airport to report for duty . \nHe collapsed around two hours into the flight , and was isolated from the other passengers . \nNone of the other crew members or passengers reported similar symptoms . \nA BA spokeswoman said : `` We can confirm one of our cabin crew felt unwell during the flight from Mexico and was taken to hospital on arrival at Heathrow . \nThe Port Health Authority met the flight at Heathrow and no other passengers or crew were detained . '' \nThe Mexican government yesterday issued a decree authorising President Felipe Caldern to invoke powers allowing the country 's health department to isolate patients and inspect homes , travellers and baggage . \nMexico 's health secretary , Jos Angel Crdova , said : `` We are very , very concerned . '' \nYesterday , people in Mexico City were being ordered not to kiss or shake hands . \nFootball matches went ahead without spectators , theaters , shops and museums were closed , staff were inside locked schools scrubbing classrooms with disinfectant , and health workers patrolled buses , ordering sickly looking people home . \nThe WHO stopped short of issuing a worldwide alert over the swine flu strain , but its director general , Dr Margaret Chan , said that option remained `` on the table '' . \nScientists have long feared that a new flu virus could launch a worldwide pandemic . \nEvolving when different flu viruses infect a pig , a person or a bird , mingling their genetic material , a hybrid could spread quickly because humans would have no natural defences . \n`` We are seeing a range of severity of the disease , from mild to severe , and of course death , '' said Chan . \n`` The eight cases in the US have been mild in terms of severity and it is too premature to calculate the mortality rate of this disease . '' \nAny doubts over the extent of the emergency were dispelled last night by the sight of soldiers handing out blue surgical masks to pedestrians and motorists along Mexico City 's central boulevard , Paseo de la Reforma . \nWith TV and radio calling on the population to seek medical advice for any flu-like symptoms , queues grew at clinics and hospitals across the city . \nCaldern said his government learned only on Thursday night what kind of virus Mexico was facing after tests by specialist laboratories in Canada confirmed the outbreak as a type - labeled A\\/H1N1 - not previously seen in pigs or humans . \nFew of the cases appear to have had any contact with live pigs . \nThe WHO said the virus appeared to be able to spread from human to human and contained human virus , avian virus and pig viruses from North America , Europe and Asia . \nGiven how quickly flu can spread , there might be cases incubating around the world already , said Dr Michael Osterholm at the University of Minnesota : `` Hundreds and thousands of travellers come in and out -LRB- of Mexico -RRB- every day . '' \nIt was unclear how much protection current vaccines might offer . \nA `` seed stock '' genetically matched to the new virus has already been created by the US Centres for Disease Control . \nIf the US government decides vaccine production is necessary , it would be used by manufacturers to get started . \nAt Mexico City 's international airport , passengers were questioned to try to prevent anyone with flu symptoms from boarding aircraft and spreading the disease . \nThe Foreign Office issued a warning to UK travellers about the outbreak , but stopped short of recommending people did not visit Mexico . \nUS health officials took a similar line , urging visitors to wash their hands frequently .

{"txt": "We must not be blackmailed by Merkel 's neoliberal gang Schr der 's government has made mistakes , but it is on the side of the disadvantaged and kept us out of an illegal war As hard as it will be to achieve this result in the German elections , I none the less make the case for the Social Democrat and Green coalition to continue in government under the chancellor , Gerhard Schrder , and the foreign minister , Joschka Fischer . \nBoth have the courage to undertake difficult reforms ; both have demonstrated responsible behavior in the face of crises . \nLet us recall : four years ago the attack on the World Trade Centre shook America - and Germany . \nThe chancellor promised the US unswerving support in the fight against terrorism - but he added a caveat that Germany would not get involved in military adventures . \nThat warning proved all too necessary . \nShortly afterwards , in the words of the US president , Iraq was declared the No 1 rogue state . \nAmerica 's former ally , Saddam Hussein , became the devil incarnate . \nBased on the flimsy claim that nuclear weapons were being produced in Iraq , a war ensued that made victims of Iraq 's civilians and has not ended . \nWe now know that the US deceived its allies , and some were led a merry dance into volunteering for war . \nThe German government - whose predecessors were known for their unthinking allegiance - had the courage to speak out against the president of a superpower ; Willy Brandt would have described it as `` courage before a friend '' . \nOf course , the opposition CDU-CSU was horrified . \nHow could the superpower be rebuked in such a foolhardy way ? \nThe chancellor and foreign minister were not swayed . \nTo this day , they have stood by this responsible decision and at the same time shown themselves to be loyal to the role of the UN . \nIf the Stoiber-Merkel duo had won the last election , in 2002 , Germany and its soldiers would be embroiled in the war , suffering the consequences that the people of Iraq and every `` willing '' ally are enduring to this day . \n \nMs Fischer is a strong- spirited woman . \nTo vote her into federal office would be reckless . \nAnd who would take over Fischer 's responsibility for foreign policy ? \nA joker named Guido Westerwelle -LRB- from the Free Democratic party , the CDU 's coalition partner -RRB- , for example ? \nHere we already have a party that , seeking to favor high earners , has submitted to the dogmas of neoliberalism . \nWith lunatic plans for tax cuts it , along with the CDU , has cosied up to big business . \nOthers have made mistakes , and I do not want to minimize the misjudgments that chancellor Schrder 's government has made . \nPromises made by employers were believed for too long ; considerable income-tax cuts resulted only in demands for further cuts ; profits are being pocketed , not invested in new jobs ; directors of banks and major industries are giving themselves fraudulently high salaries and payoffs - while demanding , often using blackmail , that workers go without wage rises . \nThe permanent threat of job losses allows trade unions to be intimidated and the working population to be manipulated . \nThe Social Democrats and Greens have given in to such pressure too often - in a manner that is detrimental to democracy . \nHow will we get anywhere if groups outside parliament , such as the powerful pharmaceutical lobby , continue to influence legislation ? \nIf this continues , injustices will accumulate . \nLet us hope it is not too late for the current government to recognize that the financial consequences of its reforms should no longer favor only the very wealthy , but need to be for the good of all parts of society . \nThe FDP wants the highest rate of income tax to fall to 35 % . \nThen again , Paul Kirchhof , Frau Merkel 's wunderkind and her choice for finance minister , plans to outdo them with his neoliberal masterpiece of a 25 % flat-rate income tax for all . \nOne can only hope that as many people as possible will recognize this swindle before he gets near government . \nPlease do n't tell us that the big parties are all the same , and that there is no longer a left and a right . \nIt is the Social Democrats and the Green party that stood up for employees ' rights against the Christian Democrats ' neoliberal obsession with redundancy . \nIt is the Social Democrats that stood up for comprehensive schools . \nIt is the CDU and CSU , on the other hand , that are always attempting to block the way to educational justice . \nIt is the Greens ' admirably brave minister Renate Kunast who takes the farming lobby to task and is committed to protecting the consumer . \nIt is the Greens and Social Democrats who imposed a nuclear ban and promoted renewable energy , creating new jobs . \nIt is true that the initial move towards reform by the red-green coalition was full of mistakes . \nBut they had the desire to learn from their errors . \nAt the same time , the CDU made a point of badmouthing Germany , particularly from an economic standpoint . \nIn parliament 's upper house , the CDU has been blocking a multitude of reforms . \nIts conduct as an opposition party has taken on a destructive nature . \nThe only thing it is good at is complaining . \nOur country must not sink into self-pity nor lapse again into the stagnation of the Helmut Kohl era . \nMore courage is needed to make essential changes , even those that may hurt . \nThanks to new legislation , hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals have gained the possibility of German residency . \nThey are an asset to our country , because their cultures contribute to the color and variety of our society . \nOnly when their own cultures are respected will they be ready to recognize the enrichment they would get from the German culture and language . \nWith this we come again to Schrder and Fischer . \nBoth are capable of admitting mistakes and correcting them . \nBoth are occasionally criticised for their arrogance . \nThat 's all very well , but when one has drive and energy , and the other self-confidence , and both fearlessly handle the media , they deserve to survive . \nAfter all , it is thanks to their fierce determination that our soldiers escaped a war that was contrary to international law . \nTheir actions reinforced Germany 's reputation abroad . \nI will vote for the red-green alliance because it protected us from war ; had the courage to face difficult reforms ; is on the side of the socially disadvantaged ; and will save us from descending into a US-style class system . \nGnter Grass was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 1999 ; a version of this article first appeared in the Sddeutsche Zeitung Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : G nter Grass : We must not be blackmailed by Merkel 's neoliberal gang This article appeared on p33 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 03.04 BST on Friday 16 September 2005 ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/iraqwar_guardian/rsd/IraqWar_guardian__2005-09-16__86.rsd.txt.ll_filled"}

{"txt": "GOLDEN MEADOW , Louisiana | Mon May 31 , 2010 9:36 am EDT GOLDEN MEADOW , Louisiana -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Carol Terrebonne , a wholesale retailer who buys shrimp off the boats in southern Louisiana , laughs when asked about the $ 5,000 hardship payout she has received from energy giant BP to cushion the economic impact of the Gulf oil spill . \n`` It barely pays the power bill . \nI have two facilities and they have ice machines and cold storage , '' she said in her cramped roadside office , seated beneath pictures of Jesus and the Virgin Mary . \nAs of Sunday , BP said 26,000 claims had been filed by commercial fishermen , angling guides and others who say they have lost income because of the six-week-old spill , which the White House says is probably the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history . \nOf those claims , 11,650 had been paid for a total of $ 35 million . \n \n \nI do n't know what 's going to happen to our oysters out there in the water , '' he said . \nHe said he had received his $ 5,000 from BP but said he was making $ 2,000 a day before the spill closed down his 1,500-acre -LRB- 600-hectare -RRB- recreational oyster operation . \u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afBP has said it is aware that recent years'earnings are below what some people could reasonably have expected to make this year . \nAs local fishermen rue the season that got away , BP says it is ready to pay more in their individual claims , but for now it is focused on what it calls `` hardship payments '' to help mitigate immediate loss of income . \n`` If they need more they can come back to us . \nThese immediate hardship claims do not preclude the longer-term claims , '' said BP spokesman David Nicholas . \nBut anger over the process is mounting on several fronts in steamy bayou villages where shrimp boats sit idle and sports fishing guides while their extra time away in bars . \nThe anger focuses first on the amounts paid out so far , which many locals say is hardly enough to pay bills and make ends meet . \nSeveral locals who spoke to Reuters had received $ 5,000 , but others said they had been given less . \n`` My understanding is that if you are a captain\\/guide and own a boat , you get $ 5,000 , but if you are just a captain or just own a boat you get $ 2,500 , '' said sport angling guide Alec Griffin , who specializes in fly fishing . \n`` I own the boat but it 's still registered in the name of my friend who I bought it from , so I just got $ 2,500 . \nIt just helps to ease the sting from canceled trips , '' he said . \nMany locals are also upset that they have to present tax documentation and paperwork to show their income over the previous three years as a way to assess their losses in 2010 . \nThe recovery from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , the economic recession and record-high fuel prices mean that the past few years have been lean ones for many . \nOthers have also only been working in their current occupations for a year , making it difficult to estimate income loss for this season . \nMany were banking on this year as the `` big one '' as the economy recovers from recession . \nAnd for a number of reasons -- the lack of serious storms last year , the amount of winter rainfall -- fishing conditions this year looked superb . \n`` It would have been a good summer ; the marsh was in good shape , there was lots of clean water , '' said Griffin . \nIn the New Orleans suburb of Belle Chasse , oysterman Kuzma Tesvich said he had had high hopes for 2010 . \n`` Our crop was good . \nWe expected a good season and a good year but after all this we do n't know what 's going to happen to our oysters out there in the water , '' he said . \nHe said he had received his $ 5,000 from BP but said he was making $ 2,000 a day before the spill closed down his 1,500-acre -LRB- 600-hectare -RRB- oyster operation . \nBP has said it is aware that recent years ' earnings are below what some people could reasonably have expected to make this year . \nLast week , it said it would appoint an independent mediator to settle any disputes over claims that arise . \nIt has also said it will be flexible with people who do n't have all of their paperwork in order . \nHundreds of Gulf Coast fishermen are also being paid by BP to help with its oil spill containment operations , which also clearly helps bridge some of the lost earnings gap . \nBut the notion of handouts is alien to the resilient people here , many of whom have a strong sense of independence . \n`` These people are self-employed , they are not used to being reduced to handouts and to looking for help , '' said Father Gerry , the Catholic priest in the bayou town of Port Sulphur . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI do n't think the damage will be confined to the Gulf area as this article seems to indicate . \nThe oil spill is spreading not only on the surface but also deep in the ocean , and fish in any depth of the ocean would wallow the oil droplet and many would swim to faraway places or would be eaten by other fish which end up at faraway places . \nEventually the fishery industry of the entire lower 48 states would be damaged . \nI do n't know if it is safe to eat seafood in Boston or NYC a couple of years down the road . \nAny expert opinions on this ? \nURGENT_GET THIS MESSAGE TO OBAMA : get ALL the major oil companies , Shell , Exxon , etc , all the data they need to work on stopping the oil leak . \nWhoever stops it first then they give BP the bill . \nWhoever can clean it up the quickest , BP gets their bill too . \nEveryone post and pass this message on . \nFinger point AFTER leak stopped and cleanup in progress . \nSomeone at Lloyds of London insurance Company sold BP , policies covering just such an oil spill as is happening now , knowing full well that BP did not know how to fix problems like this . \nLloyds needs to find out who did the selling as they are responsible for massive claims that LLOYDS will have to pay . \nProbably the same people that sold BP shares short a few months ago and the same people that saw to it the rig got blown up . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-05-31__2033.rsd.txt.ll_filled"}
{"txt": "The outrages of Abu Ghraib are no accident , says Stephen Sedley The Torture Papers : The Road to Abu Ghraib edited by Karen J Greenberg and Joshua L Dratel -LRB- 900pp , Cambridge , # 27.50 -RRB- Torture and Truth : America , Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror by Mark Danner -LRB- 650pp , Granta , # 16.99 -RRB- How cruelly is a captor allowed to treat a captive before the pain and fear amount to torture ? \nAccording to advice given by US Assistant Attorney-General Jay S Bybee to President 's Counsel Alberto Gonzales in August 2002 , it `` must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function or even death '' . \nWith the sanction of such morally and legally ignoble advice , the US has been interrogating , and from time to time killing , an unknown number of captives in Guantnamo , Afghanistan , Iraq and almost certainly elsewhere . \nThe torture program was carried out by the CIA , the FBI and the American-led military . \nThe solitary governmental voice apparently raised against it was that of Colin Powell , who is no longer secretary of state . \nEurope is not entirely divorced from this process . \nWhen Ireland took the United Kingdom to the European Court of Human Rights over the treatment of suspects in Northern Ireland in 1978 , the Strasbourg court held that such practices as hooding , sensory disorientation and sleep disruption in pursuit of information amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment - which are also banned by the human rights convention - but not to torture . \nBybee and his colleagues built on this in seeking to limit the meaning of torture , for the purposes of the international Convention Against Torture , to little more than mutilation and murder . \nBut they also , and inconsistently , developed a theory that in fighting terrorism the president , as commander-in-chief , is in any case not bound by either national or international law . \nGonzales , for his part , brought into being the hitherto unknown category of `` unlawful combatant '' , to whom the protections of the Geneva Conventions could be denied because , although a soldier , such a combatant was fighting for a faction -LRB- the Taliban or al-Qaida -RRB- and not a state . \nThe word `` unlawful '' in this context has no meaning except to signify that such people will be denied the protection of the law . \nThe licence it carries has been silently transferred to Iraq , which on any view is a state . \nPowell 's objections to the destruction of the work of a century of international law were brushed aside by Gonzales . \nThe documents which have now revealed all this , and very much more , are collected in each of these solid volumes . \nThey cover largely the same ground - an assembly of official memoranda and reports , most of them never intended for publication , prefaced by brief editorial essays . \nAlthough Mark Danner 's book is short of an index , there is little need for more : comment on most of the documents would look feeble beside the documents themselves . \nThe official military reports on the revealed abuses have been published by the US administration . \nThe rest -LRB- including , one assumes , the report of the International Red Cross , which ordinarily speaks only to governments -RRB- have been leaked ; though in some cases - notably that of the legal memoranda - partial leakage prompted full disclosure . \nNothing much seems to have been obtained under the Freedom of Information Act . \nFor Iraqis , already accustomed to unspeakable things happening to anyone detained by Saddam 's police in Abu Ghraib , little can have changed . \nBut one of America 's leading legal journalists , Anthony Lewis of the New York Times , in an illuminating introduction to The Torture Papers , draws out the grim moral that - in the words of the former national security adviser to George Bush senior , Donald Gregg - it was the legal memoranda that `` cleared the way for the horrors that have been revealed '' in the US-run detention facilities . \nThese books contain extensive evidence that Lewis and Gregg are right . \nThey include a mass of depositions and reports about what was going on in the detention facilities . \nReading the detailed and objective findings of investigating officers , one begins to wonder whether the brutality was not in truth the rogue activity of a few privates , corporals and paramilitaries , while the legal sanctioning of torture thousands of miles away in Washington had more to do with the sophisticated techniques taught over many decades by the US Special Forces and CIA to client dictatorships . \nBut it becomes inexorably apparent that the crude use of fear and pain on detainees was not simply the localized abuse of absolute power by individuals unfit to hold it . \nStripping Iraqi men of their clothing and making them wear women 's underwear for days on end , or setting dogs on them when naked , makes a precise fit with the official doctrine that anything short of killing and maiming is a legitimate way of breaking people down for interrogation . \nEvidence has crept out of Afghanistan of the use of similar techniques there . \nDanner , in one of his own New York Review of Books articles which introduce his volume , traces `` water-boarding '' -LRB- repeated near-drowning -RRB- from the French war in Algeria through the dirty war in Argentina to the interrogation since 9\\/11 by CIA operatives of `` high value '' suspects in locations which have never been disclosed . \nDoes even a democracy have nevertheless to countenance such methods when its back is to the wall ? \nOther democracies have not thought so : many of their governments have refused to pass illiberal laws in response to terrorism , and where some have sought to do so their judiciaries have pointed out that if the reaction to terrorists is to abandon the rule of law , terrorism will have achieved an irreversible victory . \nThe supreme court of India in 2003 held that India 's prevention of terrorism laws must respect the fundamental human rights recognized in the constitution . \nThe Israeli supreme court , under its remarkable president Aharon Barak , has - not too successfully , it must be said - told the government and army in a series of judgments that while democracy is fated to fight with one hand tied behind its back , `` none the less , it has the upper hand . \nPreserving the rule of law and recognition of individual liberties ... strengthen its spirit , and this strength allows it to overcome its difficulties '' . \nIn this country the law lords , rejecting the legacy of wartime decisions permitting arbitrary executive detention , have found detention without trial a greater evil than the evil it is intended to challenge . \nPerhaps the strongest evidence that the abuse of prisoners in US hands has been systemic , not aberrant , is the simplest : it is the fact that those involved felt it was quite safe to be photographed repeatedly while committing it . \nPersonnel who fear disciplinary reprisal , or even disapproval , do not usually make a visual record of their conduct . \nIf it says something for Donald Rumsfeld , the defense secretary , that he twice tendered his resignation over the Abu Ghraib disclosures , it says rather more about the Bush administration that his offer was on both occasions rejected . \nThe outcome of the events tracked in these two books , for which both men bear responsibility , is a world order of which the icon has become a hooded figure , its arms outstretched in torment . \nThe apologists who blame a few bad apples in the barrel might do well to remember what a few bad apples do : they make the whole barrel rotten . \nStephen Sedley is a judge of the court of appeal for England and Wales Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : The Torture Papers and Torture and Truth This article appeared on p14 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.27 GMT on Saturday 5 March 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting .

'' \nsaid AP Anadarko CEO Tom Hackett in a prepared statement . \nThe only other major well design , which is more expensive , includes more safeguards against a natural-gas blowout of the kind that destroyed the Deepwater Horizon . \nA Wall Street Journal analysis of records provided by the U.S. Minerals Management Service shows that BP used the less costly design -- called `` long string '' -- on 35 percent of its deepwater wells since July 2003 , the earliest date the well-design data were available . \nAnadarko used it on 42 percent of its deepwater Gulf wells , though it says it does n't do so in wells of the type drilled by BP . \nBP chief executive officer Tony Hayward said in a statement that the company strongly disagreed with the allegations `` These allegations will neither distract the company 's focus on stopping the leak nor alter our commitment to restore the Gulf coast , '' Hayward said . \n`` Other parties besides BP may be responsible for costs and liabilities arising from the oil spill , and we expect those parties to live up to their obligations . '' \nBoth companies used the design much more often , on average , than other major Gulf drillers . \nOut of 218 deepwater wells in the Gulf drilled since July 2003 , 26 percent used the long-string design . \nIt derives its name from its use of a single , long `` string '' of pipe from the sea floor to the bottom of the well . \nOther big drillers use long-string design less frequently than BP , according to the Journal 's data analysis . \nRoyal Dutch Shell PLC used long string designs on 8 percent of its wells and Chevron Corp. on 15 percent . \nAustralian firm BHP Billiton PLC used long string on 4 percent of its wells .

'' \nFriends of the journalists remembered them Thursday as brave men committed to finding and exposing the truth even in dangerous conditions . \nHondros had written an e-mail Wednesday `` basically saying that everything was fine and stable and he was enjoying his assignment and getting some good photographs , '' his friend Greg Campbell , who recently traveled to Libya with Hondros , told CNN . \nGallery : Chris Hondros ' final photos Photojournalist Hetherington killed in Libya Two photojournalists killed in Misrata `` Every time you 're in an environment like that , I think in the back of your mind you 've realized that you may not come out of there , '' Campbell said . \nHe and Hondros covered conflicts in Sierra Leone , Kosovo , and Nigeria together , he said . \nHondros `` was always very , very safe . \nHe realized the risks and he tried to minimize them as much as possible . \nSo when I was traveling with Chris , we would take as many precautions as we possibly could . '' \n`` There are times , unfortunately , when you just do n't know which decision is right or wrong . \nUnfortunately , that 's what Tim and Chris found themselves in . '' \nHetherington received an Academy Award nomination this year for `` Restrepo , '' a documentary chronicling the deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan 's Korengal Valley . \nIt was co-directed by journalist Sebastian Junger . \nEmployed by Panos Pictures , Hetherington also worked with CNN in Afghanistan two years ago . \nCNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen described Hetherington as humble , modest and a gentleman skilled in the taking of gritty photos of combat . '' \n` Restrepo ' was a labor of love for Tim ; he had a great deal of empathy for the young soldiers he documented , '' Bergen wrote . \n`` The resulting film is not only the best documentary about war I have ever seen , it is simply one of the greatest of all war films , sharing the epic quality of movies like ` Apocalypse Now ' or ` Full Metal Jacket . ' \nIt is also very beautifully shot , revealing Tim 's great sense of picture composition . '' \nHetherington 's last Twitter entry appears to have been made Tuesday : `` In besieged Libyan city of Misrata . \nindiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces . \nNo sign of NATO . '' \nThe journalists were walking in the front-line area at the end of Tripoli Street on the western edge of Misrata when a rocket-propelled grenade exploded , according to a town resident who wanted to be identified only as `` Mohammed '' for safety reasons . \nThe group was traveling with rebel fighters , he said . \nVanity Fair magazine , where Hetherington , 40 , was a contributing photographer , described him as `` widely respected by his peers for his bravery and camaraderie . '' \nIts profile says he had dual U.S. and British citizenship . \nVanity Fair released a statement from Hetherington 's family . \n`` Tim was in Libya to continue his ongoing multimedia project to highlight humanitarian issues during time of war and conflict , '' it said . \n`` He will be forever missed .

'' \nHondros ' work is featured in a multimedia exhibit slated to open May 7 in Chicago that features war images and is called Conflict Zone . \nAt a panel discussion on war reporting in 2006 put on by the International Reporting Project in Washington , Hondros -- who had been to Iraq nine times by then -- had little sympathy for journalists who complained about conditions on the ground . \n`` I can talk about how I wish it was , '' he said , `` but , to me , the most important thing is just figuring out the way to cover it , which is what war journalists do all over the world .

{"txt": "By Jennifer Rizzo , CNN National Security Producer Adm. James Stavridis says there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda in the Libyan opposition . \nHe sees `` more than reasonable '' chance Gadhafi will leave power Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There is a good chance NATO pressure will encourage Libyan tyrant Moammar Gadhafi to leave power , the U.S. NATO commander told Congress Tuesday , but the opposition that could come in the Libyan leader 's wake has `` flickers '' of al Qaeda . \nWhile there is a wide range of possible outcomes in Libya , running from a static stalemate to Gadhafi cracking , there is a `` more than reasonable '' chance of Gadhafi leaving power , Adm. James Stavridis said before the Senate Armed Services Committee , But potential `` flickers '' of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements have been seen in intelligence regarding the Libyan opposition , which is poised to take power if Gadhafi leaves , Stavridis said . \n`` `` I think it is fair to say that there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda in the Libyan opposition , '' Stavridis told the Senate Armed Services Committee . \nStavridis is also the commander of U.S. European Command . \n`` The intelligence that I 'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that I 'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against Col. Gadhafi , '' Stavridis added . \nThe comments come the same day as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of Libya 's opposition in London . \nClinton and the heads of 40 other countries met Tuesday to discuss Libya 's future . \nA senior counterterrorism official , unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record , backed up Stavridis ' assessment , downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition . \nThere is probably `` a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda '' in Libya among the rebels , `` but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates , '' the official said . \nAl Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years . \nIt `` would n't be surprising if small numbers -- a handful '' -- of extremists or al Qaeda are in Libya . \n`` It 's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition , '' the official said , but `` the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya . '' \nIf Gadhafi 's forces cease fighting there would be a series of decisions on how NATO should proceed . \nLeading the senators through the NATO command chain , Stavridis said the intelligence and ground assessments would work their way up through NATO , first going through Canadian Gen. Charles Bouchard leading the NATO operation in Libya , then up to Stavridis and eventually going up to the United Nations for the ultimate decision on course of action , Stavridis said . \n`` I think there would be actually another level that this discussion would have to go to , which would be the United Nations since the authority for NATO to participate in this operation is under the United Nations Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 , '' Stavridis pointed out . \nDuring this process there would be a pause in NATO activity over Libya . \nBut for now the fight is still very much on . \nNo-fly air zones have been set up to allow air assets to strike Libyan forces if the civilian population is threatened , Stavridis said , going beyond a basic no-fly zone patrol mission . \nFor the first time , A-10 and AC-130 ground attack aircraft were used over the weekend in Libya , Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at a press briefing on Monday . \nThese aircraft fire machine gun rounds from cannons , up to thousands of rounds a minute , and due to their low-altitude flying ability provide more precision in densely populated areas . \nOn Monday night , one A-10 aircraft attacked Libyan coast guard ships in the port of Misrata after reports were confirmed that the ships were firing at merchant vessels . \nNATO is set to take control of the full operation in Libya including protecting civilians on Thursday , greatly easing the financial costs on the United States , which has already hit $ 550 million as of Monday , according to Pentagon figures . \nOf those costs , 60 % were for munitions , the Pentagon said , including Tomahawk missiles , which cost $ 1.4 million each . \nThe United States has launched approximately 200 since the beginning of the operation . \n`` Future costs are highly uncertain , '' Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr.

'' \nIt said Browner was overstating the findings of a NOAA analysis of the fate of the oil . \n`` By initially underestimating the amount of oil flow and then , at the end of the summer , appearing to underestimate the amount of oil remaining in the Gulf , the federal government created the impression that it was either not fully competent to handle the spill or not fully candid with the American people about the scope of the problem , '' the report said . \nThe documents for the first time put the White House at the center of the long running dispute between the administration and independent scientists about how much oil was discharged into the Gulf , and how much remains in the water . \nAt first , BP claimed the well was leaking 1,000 barrels a day . \nBy early May , the administration had revised its estimate upwards to 5,000 barrels a day , but based its assessment on the work of a single NOAA scientist using `` overly casual '' analysis of satellite images of oil on the surface of the ocean . \nThe administration clung to that estimate which turned out to be 12 times lower than the actual spill size despite known inaccuracies in the scientists ' work , the report said . \nIt went on : `` Loss of the public trust during a disaster is not an incidental public relations problem .

{"txt": "This picture from Jordanian state-run TV shows Sajida al-Rishawi confessing to her failed attempt to set off an explosives belt inside one of the three Amman hotels . \nPhotograph : Marco di Lauro\\/Getty In her black coat and white headscarf , Sajida al-Rishawi looked like many other Arab women . \nBut the shapeless garment made it easy for her to conceal a belt of explosives and a belt of ball bearings - and her mission , along with her husband , to blow up a hotel full of wedding guests . \nAppearing on Jordanian television last night the woman , 35 , described how she had traveled from Iraq to Jordan to play her part in last Wednesday 's triple suicide attack on three Amman hotels that left 57 dead and more than 90 wounded . \nWearing the disarmed explosive belt over her coat , she turned around as if modelling it and demonstrated how she had planned to pull the red cord that would have detonated the explosives . \nShe said she had tried to blow up the bomb in the hotel but it did n't work . \nWringing her hands but sounding calm and confident , she described to an interviewer on live television how she and her husband , Ali Hussein Shamari , had traveled from Iraq to the Jordanian capital . \nThere they rented an apartment and her husband taught her how to use the bomb . \n`` He said it was for the attack on hotels in Jordan , '' she said . \n`` We rented a car and entered the hotel on November 5 . \nMy husband and I went inside and he went to one corner and I went to another . \n`` There was a wedding at the hotel with children , women and men inside . \nMy husband detonated -LRB- his bomb -RRB- and I tried to explode my belt but it would n't . \nPeople fled running and I left running with them , '' she said . \nAt a press conference earlier in the day , Marwan Muasher , the deputy prime minister of Jordan , said that when the husband noticed his wife was having trouble detonating her bomb by pulling its primer cord , he `` pushed her out of the ballroom '' . \n`` Once she was out , he blew himself up , '' he told reporters . \nThe bomb strapped to the man 's body was packed with the powerful explosive RDX and ball bearings , and was designed to kill many people . \nIf his wife had succeeded in her attempt , the carnage would have been much worse . \nShamari killed the majority of the 57 bombing victims at the Radisson hotel . \nAll were Jordanians or Palestinians . \nThe fathers of the bride and groom were killed and the mother of the bride is in a coma . \nAlthough those holding their hands were killed , the married couple escaped unhurt . \nMr Muasher said the three successful suicide bombers who attacked the Grand Hyatt , Radisson and Days Inn hotels were Iraqis from Anbar , the Iraqi province bordering Jordan . \nThey were named as Shamari , 35 ; Rawad Jassem Mohammed Abed , 23 ; and Safaa Mohammed Ali , 23 . \nMs Rishawi was identified as the sister of Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi , a leader of al-Qaida in Iraq in Anbar province . \nHe was believed to have been killed by US forces in Falluja last year . \nHe was reported to have been the deputy of Abu Musab Zarqawi , the Jordanian-born leader of al-Qaida in Iraq who has been sentenced to death in absentia by a Jordanian court . \nThe four bombers drove into Jordan from Iraq on November 4 , five days before the attacks , and rented an apartment in western Amman . \nThey left their apartment on Wednesday and took taxis to the hotels , including the Radisson , where almost 300 people were attending a wedding reception in one of the hotel 's ballrooms . \nMr Muasher said : `` It is clear from the way she was dressed and the explosive belts with ball bearings that they wanted to target innocent civilians , and also wanted to inflict the biggest number of casualties and victims . '' \nThe arrest of Ms Rishawi appears to confirm the authenticity of a series of statements posted on the internet by al-Qaida in Iraq . \nThe group said it had sent four Iraqis , including a husband and wife , to carry out the bombings but Jordanian police said they found the bodies of only three male bombers . \nThe al-Qaida statements attempted to justify the attacks on the hotels because they were frequented by prostitutes , spies and `` apostates '' . \nKing Abdullah II of Jordan told American television that the Iraqis had deliberately tried to kill Jordanians rather than westerners . \n`` This was nothing to do with the west . \nThis targeted Jordanian citizens - innocent men , women and children , '' he said . \n`` The majority of the country poured out to denounce what Zarqawi and al-Qaida did , calling for Zarqawi to be brought to justice , for him to burn in hell . '' \nHe said that Jordan was `` suffering from the effects '' of the US-led Iraq war , `` but we are all hoping , I think as is everybody in the world , that at the end of the day Iraq will be part of the international community '' . \nAmman 's western hotels are populated by guests from all over the world . \nMost are engaged in work in Jordan and Iraq . \nHowever , Jordanians regularly use the banqueting rooms , restaurants , health clubs and lobbies for business and personal reasons .

{"txt": "Full text : Iraq legal advice The full text of the advice about the legality of war with Iraq given by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , to the prime minister , Tony Blair , on March 7 2003 1 . \nYou have asked me for advice on the legality of military action against Iraq without a further resolution of the Security Council . \nThis is , of course , a matter we have discussed before . \nSince then , I have had the benefit of discussions with the Foreign Secretary and Sir Jeremy Greenstock -LRB- the then British ambassador to the UN -RRB- , who have given me valuable background information on the negotiating history of resolution 1441 . \nIn addition , I have also had the opportunity to hear the views of the US Administration from their perspective as co-sponsors of the resolution . \nThis note considers the issues in detail in order that you are in a position to understand the legal reasoning . \nMy conclusions are summarised at paragraphs 26 to 31 below . \nPossible legal bases for the use of force : 2 . \nAs I have previously advised , there are generally three possible bases for the use of force : -LRB- a -RRB- self-defence -LRB- which may include collective self-defence -RRB- ; -LRB- b -RRB- exceptionally , to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe ; and -LRB- c -RRB- authorisation by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter . \nForce may be used in self-defence if there is an actual or imminent threat of an armed attack ; the use of force must be necessary , ie the only means of averting an attack ; and the force used must be a proportionate response . \nIt is now widely accepted that an imminent armed attack will justify the use of force if the other conditions are met . \nThe concept of what is imminent may depend on the circumstances . \nDifferent considerations may apply , for example , where the risk is of attack from terrorists sponsored or harboured by a particular State , or where there is a threat of an attack by nuclear weapons . \nHowever , in my opinion there must be some degree of imminence . \nI am aware that the USA has been arguing for recognition of a broad doctrine of a right to use force to pre-empt danger in the future . \nIf this means more than a right to respond proportionately to an imminent attack -LRB- and I understand that the doctrine is intended to carry that connotation -RRB- this is not a doctrine which , in my opinion , exists or is recognized in international law . \nThe use of force to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe has been emerging as a further , and exceptional , basis for the use of force . \nIt was relied on by the UK in the Kosovo crisis and is the underlying justification for the No-Fly Zones . \nThe doctrine remains controversial , however . \nI know of no reason why it would be an appropriate basis for action in present circumstances . \nForce may be used where this authorised -LRB- sic -RRB- by the UN Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter . \nThe key question is whether resolution 1441 has the effect of providing such authorisation . \nAs you are aware , the argument that resolution 1441 itself provides the authorisation to use force depends on the revival of the express authorisation to use force given in 1990 by Security Council resolution 678 . \nThis in turn gives rise to two questions : -LRB- a -RRB- is the so-called `` revival argument '' a sound legal basis in principle ? \n-LRB- b -RRB- is resolution 1441 sufficient to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 ? \nI deal with these questions in turn . \nIt is a trite , but nonetheless relevant observation given what some commentators have been saying , that f the answer to these two questions is `` yes '' , the use of force will have been authorised by the United Nations and not in defiance of it . \nFollowing its invasion and annexation of Kuwait , the Security Council authorised the use of force against Iraq in resolution 678 -LRB- 1990 -RRB- . \nThis resolution authorised coalition forces to use all necessary means to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and to restore international eace and security in the area . \nThe resolution gave a legal basis for Operation Desert Storm , which was brought to an end by the ceasefire set out by the Council in resolution 687 -LRB- 1991 -RRB- . \nThe conditions for the ceasefire in that resolution -LRB- and subsequent resolutions -RRB- imposed obligations on Iraq with regard to the elimination of WMD and monitoring of its obligations . \nResolution 687 suspended , but did not terminate , the authority to use force in resolution 678 . \nNor has any subsequent resolution terminated the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 . \nIt has been the UK 's view that a violation of Iraq 's obligations under resolution 687 which is sufficiently serious to undermine the basis of the ceasefire can revive the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 . \nIn reliance on this argument , force has been used on certain occasions . \nI am advised by the Foreign Office Legal Advisers that this was the basis for the use of force between 13 and 18 January 1993 following UN Presidential Statements on 8 and 11 January 1993 condemning particular failures by Iraq to observe the terms of the ceasefire resolution . \nThe revival argument was also the basis for the use of force in December 1998 by the US and UK -LRB- Operation Desert Fox -RRB- . \nThis followed a series of Security Council resolutions , notably resolution 1205 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . \nLaw Officers have advised in the past that , provided the conditions are made out , the revival argument does provide a sufficient justification in international law for the use of force against Iraq . \nThat view is supported by an opinion given in August 1992 by the then UN Legal Counsel , Carl-August Fleischauer . \nHowever , the UK has consistently taken the view -LRB- as did the Fleischauer opinion -RRB- that , as the ceasefire conditions were set by the Security Council in resolution 687 , it is for the Council to assess whether any such breach of those obligations has occurred . \nThe US have a rather different view : they maintain that the fact of whether Iraq is in breach is a matter of objective fact which may therefore be assessed by individual Member States . \nI am not aware of any other state which supports this view . \nThis is an issue of critical importance when considering the effect of resolution 1441 . \nThe revival argument is controversial . \nIt is not widely accepted among academic commentators . \nHowever , I agree with my predecessors ' advice on this issue . \nFurther , I believe that the arguments in support of the revival argument are stronger following adoption of resolution 1441 . \nThat is because of the terms of the resolution and the course of the negotiations which led to its adoption . \nThus , preambular paragraphs 4 , 5 and 10 recall the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 and that resolution 687 imposed obligations on Iraq as a necessary condition of the ceasefire . \nOperative paragraph -LRB- OP -RRB- 1 provides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions , including the resolution 687 . \nOP13 recalls that Iraq has been warned repeatedly that `` serious consequences '' will result from continued violations of its obligations . \nThe previous practice of the Council and statements made by Council members during the negotiation of resolution 1441 demonstrate that the phrase `` material breach '' signifies a finding by the Council of a sufficiently serious breach of the cease-fire conditions to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 and that `` serious consequences '' is accepted as indicating the use of force . \nI disagree , therefore , with those commentators and lawyers , who assert that nothing less than an explicit -LRB- underlined -RRB- authorisation to use force in a Security Council resolution will be sufficient . \nIn order for the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 to be revived , there needs to be a determination by the Security Council that there is a violation of the conditions of the ceasefire and that the Security Council considers it sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the ceasefire . \nRevival will not , however , take place , notwithstanding a finding of violation , if the Security Council has made it clear either that action short of the use of force should be taken to ensure compliance with the terms of the cease-fire , or that it intends to decide subsequently what action is required to ensure compliance . \nNotwithstanding the determination of material breach in OP1 of resolution 1441 , it is clear that the Council did not intend that the authorisation in resolution 678 should revive immediately -LRB- underlined -RRB- following the adoption of resolution 1441 , since OP2 of the resolution affords Iraq a `` final opportunity '' to comply with its disarmament obligations under previous resolutions by co-operating with the enhanced inspection regime described in OPs 3 and 5-9 . \nBut OP2 also states that the Council has determined that compliance with resolution 1441 is Iraq 's last chance before the ceasefire resolution will be enforced . \nOP2 has the effect therefore of suspending the legal consequences of the OP1 determination of material breach which would otherwise have triggered the revival of the authorisation in resolution 678 . \nThe narrow but key question is : on the true interpretation of resolution 1441 , what has the Security Council decided will be the consequences of Iraq 's failure to comply with the enhanced regime . \nThe provisions relevant to determining whether or not Iraq has taken the final opportunity given by the Security Council are contained in OPs 4 , 11 and 12 of the resolution . \nOP4 provides that false statements or omissions in the declaration to be submitted by Iraq under OP3 and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441 will constitute a further material breach of Iraq 's obligations and will be reported to the Council for assessment under paragraphs 11 and 12 of the resolution . \nOP11 directs the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC and the Director-General of the IAEA to report immediately to the Council any interference by Iraq with inspection activities , as well as any failure by Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations , including the obligations regarding inspections under resolution 1441 . \nOP12 provides that the Council will convene immediately on receipt of a report in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 11 `` in order to consider the situation and the need for compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security '' . \nIt is clear from the text of the resolution , and is apparent from the negotiating history , that if Iraq fails to comply , there will be a further Security Council discussion . \nThe text is , however , ambiguous and unclear on what happens next . \nThere are two competing arguments : -LRB- i -RRB- that provided there is a Council discussion , if it does not reach a conclusion , there remains an authorisation to use force ; -LRB- ii -RRB- that nothing short of a further Council decision will be a legitimate basis for the use of force . \nThe first argument is based on the following steps -LRB- a -RRB- OP1 , by stating that Iraq `` has been and remains in material breach '' of its obligations under relevant resolutions , including resolution 687 amounts to a determination by the Council that Iraq 's violations of resolution 687 are sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the ceasefire and therefore , in principle , to revive the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 ; -LRB- b -RRB- the Council decided , however , to give Iraq `` a final opportunity '' -LRB- OP2 -RRB- but because of the clear warning that it faced `` serious consequences as a result of its continued violations '' -LRB- OP 13 -RRB- was warning that a failure to take that `` final opportunity '' would lead to such consequences ; -LRB- c -RRB- further , by OP 4 , the Council decided in advance -LRB- underlined -RRB- that false statements or omissions in its declaration and `` failure by Iraq at any time -LRB- underlined -RRB- to comply with , and cooperate fully in the implementation of , this resolution '' would constitute `` a further material breach '' ; the argument is that the Council 's determination in advance -LRB- underlined -RRB- that particular conduct would constitute a material breach -LRB- thus reviving the authorisation to use force -RRB- is as good as its determination after -LRB- underlined -RRB- the event ; -LRB- d -RRB- in either event , the Council must meet -LRB- OP 12 -RRB- `` to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security '' , but the resolution singularly does not say that the Council must decide what action to take . \nThe Council knew full well , it is argued , the difference between `` consider '' and `` decide '' and so the omission is highly significant . \nIndeed , the omission is especially important as the French and Russians made proposals to include an express requirement for a further decision , but these were rejected precisely to avoid being tied to the need to obtain a second resolution . \nOn this view , therefore , while the Council has the opportunity to take a further decision , the determinations of material breach in OPs 1 and 4 remain valid even if the Council does not act . \nThe second argument focuses , by contrast , on two provisions in particular of the resolution : first , the final words in OP4 -LRB- `` and will be reported to the Council for assessment in accordance with paragraphs 11 and 12 below '' -RRB- and , second , the requirement in OP12 for the Council to `` consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security '' . \nTaken together , it is argued , these provisions indicate that the Council decided in resolution 1441 that in the event of continued Iraqi non-compliance , the issue should return to the Council for a further decision on what action should be taken at that stage . \nSo far as OP4 of the resolution is concerned , one view is that the words at the end of this paragraph indicate the need for an assessment by the Security Council of how serious any Iraqi breaches really are and whether they are sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the ceasefire . \nThis argument is supported by public statements to the effect that only serious cases of non-compliance will constitute a further material breach . \nThus , the Foreign Secretary stated in Parliament on 25 November that `` material breach means something significant ; some behavior or pattern of behavior that is serious . \nAmong such breaches could be action by the Government of Iraq seriously to obstruct or impede the inspectors , to intimidate witnesses , or a pattern of behavior where any single action appears relatively minor but the action as a whole add up to something deliberate and more significant : something that shows Iraq 's intention not to comply '' . \nIf that is right , then the question is who makes the assessment of what constitutes a sufficiently serious breach . \nOn the UK view of the revival argument -LRB- though not the US view -RRB- that can only be the Council , because only the Council can decide if a violation is sufficiently serious to revive the authorisation to use force . \nIt is right to say , however , that such an argument has less force if OP4 operates automatically . \nThus , the wording of OP4 indicates that any failure by Iraq to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of the resolution will constitute a further material breach -LRB- leaving aside the question of whether false statements or omissions in the OP3 declaration is an additional requirement -RRB- . \nIf OP4 means what it says : the words `` cooperate fully '' were included specifically to ensure that any instances of non-cooperation would amount to a further material breach . \nThis is the US analysis of OP4 and is undoubtedly more consistent with the view that no further decision of the Council is necessary to authorise force , because it can be argued that the Council has determined in advance that any failure will be a material breach . \nIt has been suggested that it is possible to establish that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity through the procedures in OPs 11 and 12 without regard to OP4 , in which case it is unnecessary to consider the effect of the words `` for assessment '' . \nI do not consider that this argument really assists . \nFirst , the resolution must be read as a whole . \nSecond , I accept that it is possible that a Council discussion under OP12 may be triggered by a report from Blix and El-Baradei under OP11 and that this may have the effect of establishing that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity granted by OP2 . \nBut I do not consider that it can be argued seriously that OP4 does not apply in these circumstances . \nIt is clear from a comparison of the wording of paragraphs 4 and 11 that any Iraqi conduct which would be sufficient to trigger a report from the inspectors under OP11 would also amount to a failure to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of the resolution and would thus also be covered by OP4 . \nIn addition , the reference to paragraph 11 in OP4 can not be ignored . \nIt is not entirely clear what this means , but the most convincing explanation seems to be that it is a recognition that an OP11 inspectors ' report would also constitute a report of further material breach within the meaning of OP4 and would thus be assessed by the Council under OP12 . \nMoreover , the US see OP4 as an essential part of the mechanism for establishing that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity . \nRead the second part of the advice .

{"txt": "New problems arose in the struggle to contain the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as bubbles and seepage appeared in four areas around the damaged BP well , but Obama administration and company officials agreed to keep the new well cap closed for at least 24 more hours as they weigh the gravity of the developments . \nMeanwhile , at a hearing in Louisiana , attorneys for crew members of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig did battle with one another and members of a government panel investigating the April 20 explosion while revealing new details about fateful choices made hours before the blowout . \nIn Washington , the Interior Department moved to defuse tensions with shallow-water drilling firms and Gulf Coast lawmakers over how to speed up the permit process . \nBP said that one of the seepage areas , less than two miles from the Macondo well , is a natural leak not linked to the well . \nRetired Coast Guard Adm. Thad W. Allen , the national incident commander , said concerns are focused on other `` anomalies '' -- some seepage within several hundred yards of the well and bubbles appearing near the original blowout preventer on the sea floor . \nIn addition , video provided by BP showed drops of oil and gas leaking from a piece of the new containment cap just below three rams designed to cut off the flow from the well . \nThe leak has caused the formation of some hydrates -- slushlike crystals of natural gas and water that torpedoed earlier containment efforts . \nBut , Allen said , `` we do not believe this is consequential at this time . '' \nAllen and , in another briefing , BP senior executive Kent Wells said the company might make a second attempt to kill the well by shooting drilling mud into the blowout preventer . \nAn earlier attempt was aborted , but Wells said stopping the flow even temporarily would make killing the well easier . \nThe latest events added to tension that had begun to dissipate over the weekend as the new containment cap appeared to be holding fast without causing problems . \nAnd the developments highlighted the unappealing tradeoffs associated with every decision carried out a mile below the sea surface . \nAllen said that the four-day-old effort to close the well had complicated the prospects of containing the spill by channeling oil through four lines to surface ships . \nHe said that if the new cap must be opened , it would take several days to make sure sand would not clog the lines , to finish building flexible riser pipes to the surface and to hook up surface ships designed to suck oil from the cap . \nDuring that time , oil and gas would flow into the gulf . \nBut with the cap closed , the risk of broader damage to the well itself and surrounding geological structures looms large . \nIf the well is so damaged that oil and gas is leaking throughout , the hydrocarbons could seep into surrounding rock formations high above the reservoir and then into the sea . \nOr they could come out the top of the well . \nVessels using seismic equipment were scouring the area for evidence of such seepage , but their presence kept other ships from getting close enough to finish building the infrastructure that would be needed if the cap were opened . \nMeanwhile , pressure in the well continued to rise Monday , albeit slowly , reaching 6,811 pounds per square inch , Allen said in the late afternoon . \nHe said the pressure was rising about one pound per hour . \nThis , too , has triggered debate among BP and U.S. officials , who had expected the pressure to hit 8,000 psi and who thought that lower pressure readings would be a sign that oil and gas was leaking into rock formations through damaged well equipment . \nBut because of the steady increases in pressure , BP and government scientists are wondering whether so much oil and gas had been spilled already that the pressure in the partly depleted reservoir has been reduced . \nThe fight to control the well was just one piece of the picture Monday . \nNews , features , and opinions on environmental policy , the science of climate change , and tools to live a green life .

{"txt": "11th Day of Unrest in Egypt Aired February 4 , 2011 - 16:00:00 ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . \nBECKY ANDERSON , CONNECT THE WORLD , CNN : United in prayer and in protest . \nTens of thousands keep Egypt uprising against their president alive before an 11th day . \nThe Friday of departure has n't quite worked out . \nPresident Hosni Mubarak is still in office with an hour to go until midnight . \nFrom Cairo 's Tahrir Square to these jubilant demonstrators of Alexandria there is no giving up . \nANDERSON : We 're going to go live to Cairo in just in a moment first . \nWe want to show you what a difference a day makes in Egypt uprising after clashes this week killed at least 11 people in Tahrir Square . \nMany fear the worse for this Friday . \nThe mood was far different . \nProtestors were festered happy to have held their ground and hopeful the change is just around the corner . \nANDERSON : As light broke across Tahrir Square this morning a sense of anticipation filled the air for what many dubbed the day of departure . \nGovernment troops in circled the square early after two days of bloody battles between pro and anti-Mubarak protestors . \nSecurity check points was set up to search the 10s of 1000s of people before they were allowed in . \nBy 9:00 in the morning the square was getting full . \nPeople who stayed overnight shared breakfast with one another . \nMany brought in their own supplies . \nNext to them piles of rocks in case fighting broke out . \nAccording to our reporters there the mood early on was largely optimistic and peaceful . \nEgyptians stood side by side singing and dancing . \nMany chanting for Mubarak to finally leave . \nAt noon , the crowd kneeled for Friday prayers momentarily transferring the square into a place of worship . \nMany of our CNN correspondents were tweeting photos from the demonstrations . \nThese photos from Fred Pleitgen showed crowds chanting and waving flags . \nThe demos were largely festive for most of the day . \nBut by 6:00 p.m. local time there were reports of running battles between pro and anti- Mubarak protestors . \nGun fire could be heard in the air on the outskirts of Tahrir Square but it last for only a few minutes . \nAs night fell , 10s of 1000s still remain determined to see through their demands to the end . \nANDERSON : Well before we go live to Cairo a lot -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- this hour reports the US wants Mubarak out immediately . \nWe 're going to go to Washington for more on that and ask an expert why he thinks that might be a bad idea . \nThe role of the Muslim Brotherhood remains crucial . \nAyan Hirsi Ali will tell us how she was once a part of that group and what they 'll mean to Egypt 's future . \nAnd later the bigger picture , were going to explore what people in the region have been asking for and what they are really getting . \nThis is the 11th day of protest in Egypt drew to a close demonstrators got a new promise the government . \nPrime Minister Ahmed Shafik says force will not be used to clear Tahrir Square . \nWell let 's get the latest on these situations on the ground . \nArwa Damon joins us from the Cairo . \nARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Hi Becky . \nWell part of the reason that we did see that relatively speaking a sense of calm over Tahrir Square despite the clashes that happen on some of the side streets is because throughout the day he Egyptian military did maintain a much heavier presence that anything that we had seen in the past . \nThey were blocking off some of the major routes leading to the square . \nAnd we did see the pro-Mubarak group keeping their distance . \nBut that at around 10:00 pm local time around an hour ago we also saw the military with a drop on some of those positions handful of pro-Mubarak groups moving in taking up their usual positions on one of the over passes leading to the square . \nAnd despite that their presence was absence in Tahrir Square it felt for the most part it most certainly was felt once a person ventured past the square as we did today . \nWe came across small gatherings of pro-Mubarak demonstrators . \nWe squirted past them for the simple reason that it was by in large the pro- Mubarak groups that were those who were attacking the media . \nAnd at this point , it does really appear that attempt to truly diffuse this crisis have fallen flat . \nThe opposition groups denied be by President for political to meet with him over the last few days . \nThere is talk of a group of wise man as its being dubbed up trying to form some sort of an agreement between the opposition and between the governments . \nAnd although speaking relatively of course from the last few nights there is this sense of calm . \nThere is always that overriding concern that violence could erupt at any moment . \nWhen we have an interrupt it has happen immediately , suddenly and very surprisingly Becky . \nANDERSON : All right . \nArwa Damon on the ground there in Cairo . \nLet 's bring in anti-government demonstrator . \nHe 's become a regular contributor to our show over the past week or so . \nGigi Ibrahim has been protesting in Tahrir Square right from the start and she joins us now on the line from Cairo . \nHow are things at this point ? \nWe just heard from Arwa . \nWhat 's the mood in an hour to go until midnight ? \nGIGI IBRAHIM , PROTESTOR : The mood is really different today considering the violence that we had in the past two days . \nReally a lot of people turn out today to for the Friday prayer and it was such an amazing , beautiful , emotional scene . \nPeople were praying and crying for those who died since really the revolution has started and there 's a lot of self-organization . \nYou can witness coming into Tahrir you were searched maybe by 10 times by just the volunteers and average citizens who are taking up this role on themselves to make sure that there are not violent intruders within in the Tahrir Square . \nANDERSON : Gigi you think part of what is being quite a remarkable people 's revolution as it were . \nAt this point on the 11th day what sort of progress do you feel that you made ? \nIBRAHIM : Excuse me , I did n't hear you . \nANDERSON : What sort of progress do you think you 've made given that Mubarak is still in Egypt ? \nIBRAHIM : I think the progress is really Egypt had you know gained its self-confidence again . \nThe people , the people have this sense of pride and honor of being Egyptian and that is reflecting in every part in Egypt . \nYou look at the neighborhoods being protected by its own citizens . \nAnd in some sense we taken control back of our country and that 's putting a lot of pressure on Mubarak and making those people demand in Tahrir Square even more powerful . \nAnd the world is completely watching and supporting - and completely supporting the Egyptian people . \nFrom all the messages have been receiving over you know the course of this whole thing and it 's truly , truly remarkable . \nANDERSON : And yet the demands from protestors , well there 's simply one demand is n't there , that Mubarak go . \nHe is still there . \nIBRAHIM : What happens is that really the people over in Tahrir Square will not leave . \nThe determination is persistent and of staying there until Mubarak officially steps down . \nEverybody is you know knows that his time is over . \nLike he 's obviously not going to continue to be in power but the more people stay in Tahrir Square and the more violence and the more people that die because of the whole revolution it makes the people more and more determine to fight for freedom and justice and human dignity really by demanding and being more persistent for Mubarak to step down now and not in September . \nANDERSON : The pictures and crowds have been quite remarkable but if he were n't to go - I mean are you confident that he will go ? \nAnd if he does n't go will you continue to protest ? \nHow long can you keep this up ? \nIBRAHIM : I think , I think the people from my own perspective from just how I 've been there every day . \nEvery day I see I see it go up a level and the determination and the wiliness of the people to stay there as long as it takes for Mubarak to officially step down . \nI do n't think it will end peacefully at least . \nIf Mubarak does n't step down anytime soon these people can be there for weeks and days . \nAnd if the government you know will basically force the people to go out of Tahrir Square then it 's going to be obviously a massacre because these people are not going to give up easily . \nAlright Gigi you 've joined us through the week and one hopes you 'll continue to be with us as we move through the days to come . \nGigi Ibrahim there from Tahrir Square . \nWe 're staying with this story throughout the hour . \nLater from Tunisia to Yemen , Sudan and more the feedback loop from the regions protest and where that 's headed . \nAlso Ayan Hirsi Ali joins me to talk about the Muslim Brotherhood . \nYou want to listen to her she 's been part of that group . \nAnd right after this break why you need to care about Washington imagination in Cairo . \nSixty seconds away stay with us . \nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT : Will your country ever be ready in your opinion for democratic reforms ? \nHOSNI MUBARAK , EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT : The democratic reform is an ongoing process . \nWe started economic reform , political reform , and social reform at the same time . \nWhen you go back to 1981 until now in 18 years so many reforms took place . \nANDERSON : Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak there talking about a -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- for democracy way back in 1999 . \nWell for many protestors it 's not enough their president has agreed to go by September they want him out now . \nWell according to the New York Times the White House who has been discussing plans for him to leave immediately . \nMore on that in a moment first listen to this . \nWe caught up with the foreign minister today . \nHere 's how Ahmed Gheit responded to those claims . \nAHMED ABDUL GHEIT , EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER : We Egyptians were not like oppositions from abroad . \nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT : But this is your own people asking you to do this . \nGHEIT : No , no , it is not our own people . \nUNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT : There are protestors out there saying we want -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nGHEIT : The President to transform the country and we all of us will transform the country . \nAnd we will transform the country through chaos but we will transform the country through an orderly transformation . \nAnd I call it transformation and not transition . \nBecause I read the New York Times today and you relinquish power to your Vice President illegally because if you transfer power or your relinquish you relinquish power to the Speaker of parties . \nANDERSON : Well yes President Obama just spoke in Washington . \nHe did n't directly address the New York Times report but he did hint at a different strategy . \nSaying any details of a transition needs to be worked out by Egyptians . \nPRESIDENT BARRACK OBAMA : Second , the future of Egypt will be determined by its people . \nIt 's also clear that there needs to be a transition process that begins now . \nThat transition must initiate a process that respects the universal rights of the Egyptian people and that leads to free and fair elections . \nNow the details of the transition will be worked out by Egyptians . \nAnd my understanding is that some discussions have begun . \nBut we are consulting widely within in Egypt and with the international community to communicate our strong belief that a successful and orderly transition must be meaningful . \nANDERSON : Must be meaningful . \nWell our next guest pleads there 's some major risk associated with any plans to force Mubarak out immediately . \nTarek Masoud a professor at Harvard University . \nFor years he 's been a leading scholar and voice on Middle East and politics . \nHe 's got a personal stake in this story as well he 's of Egyptian origin with family in the country . \nSir thanks for joining us tonight . \nYou say he should n't be forced out immediately . \nTAREK MASOUD , PROFESSOR , HARVARD UNIVERSITY : Well I 'm not he needs to be forced out immediately . \nI 'm just saying that there are some risks associated with forcing him out immediately . \nAnd the main risk there are two risks . \nThe main one is that if you are forced out immediately the you could imagine that the crowds would dissipate and then it would be much harder for the opposition leaders to actually negotiate anything with the military . \nBut even more important than that I guess is that it would trigger a new election within 60 days a new Presidential election within 60 days . \nAnd the presidency in Egypt is kind of imperial institution . \nIt 's got Victoria powers and one of the things you would want to do before triggering a presidential election is amending the Constitution . \nAnd you ca n't amend the Constitution if the president - unless there 's an elected president sitting . \nIf there 's an interim president you ca n't dissolve the Parliament . \nI mean you could amend the Constitution but it would have to be the current Parliament that would amend it and that 's an illegitimate parliament elected through fraud . \nSo you need to dissolve the Parliament and only an elected president can do that and set that process in train . \nSo there is that Constitutional issue involved . \nThis sounds complicated but it is important . \nSo let 's pursue this . \nSo how should this orderly transition or transformation as the Foreign Minister -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- earlier on . \nHow would it work and is n't the operative word here then orderly ? \nSo this is but one path of many paths that could be taken and I do n't want to you know push to have for one path or the other . \nBut it seems to me that if you want to follow the Egyptian Constitution and get from where we are now to a more democratic order then the first thing you would do is dissolve the parliament . \nAnd that requires Mubarak to stay . \nBecause if Mubarak left whoever succeeded him could n't dissolve the Parliament and their be an election within 60 days . \nSo you dissolve this kind of illegitimate Parliament , you have new parliamentary elections within 60 days . \nThis new Parliament amends the Constitution to you know make it easier for independents to run for the presidency , to reduce some the powers of the presidency . \nAnd then Mubarak resigns and an interim President is you know appointed and that would be the Speaker of the new house , the Speaker of the new Parliament . \nAnd then you would have new presidential elections for this diminished presidency . \nSo that 's one way to do it is you follow a kind of constitutional process and there are advantages to that . \nI mean if you want to really deepen this principle of adherence to law , adherence to the Constitution what better way to do that than to you know insist on it hearing even to a Constitution that is really quite flawed . \nANDERSON : Let me throw a spanner into the works here a hypothetical spanner into the works . \nI 'm going to put you on the spot here . \nThere have been talks today , nothing that we can standup but talk that the military could actually takeover at this point . \nWhether or not Washington will be prepared to back that is another question entirely . \nHow would that change things ? \nMASOUD : Well so the military does not have the right to takeover according the existing Constitution . \nSo once the military takes over if that were a possibility now were in a land of extra Constitutionalism outside of the Constitution . \nAnd then we would be really relying on the good graces of the military to relinquish power , to set and train a reform process . \nAnd this has happen in other countries . \nThis is not to say that that could n't work in Egypt . \nBut in Egypt you have an experience with the military entering politics and taking control . \nIt happens in 1952 and Egyptians have had a devil of a time getting them to go back to the barracks . \nAnd so one worries about that particular path . \nANDERSON : I 'm going to put you on the spot again . \nI 'm going to ask you to your mind you 're Egyptian so you got of sort you know you got an interest in this more than just the fact that you academically absolutely proficient in what you 're saying tonight . \nSo to your mind at this point given what you 've seen and given what you 're hearing we have no idea who 's talking to who at this point . \nWhat do you think going to happen ? \nMAOUD : That 's a very hard question . \nI will note that we 've been paying a lot of attention to Mohammed -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- the committee that has been put together of leading opposition figures to presumably negotiate with the government . \nWe have n't spent as much time focusing on this committee of wise men . \n-LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- who are led by a man name -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- another gentleman name -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- who 's one of the Egypt 's billionaires . \nAnd they 're actually , they 've got about you know two dozen people on this committee and they 've got a plan for a transition that does seem to be a more constitutional path and that might offer a way out . \nWhat they 're proposing is that Mubarak delegate to Omar Suleiman , Omar Suleiman . \nANDERSON : Great stuff , interesting , watch out for the wise men . \nObviously something keep an eye on them . \nI 'm sorry that we lost him just at the end there coming out of Harvard for you this evening . \nWell it 's not just Egypt that 's plotting a new future . \nAcross Africa and the Middle East of course protestors are transforming the political landscape . \nComing up a look at what they 've achieved and ask where it might all end . \nPlus , it 's not first time we 've change sweep across an entire region . \nLater we 're going to hear from one man who 's witnessed history in the making first hand . \nBut next , we 've heard a lot about Muslim Brotherhood recently but what part could they play in Egypt 's future ? \nI 'm going to ask a former member . \nANDERSON : Well I see of first support for democratic reform and freedom . \nTens of thousands of people gathered in Egypt second largest city Friday to demand President Hosni Mubarak resign . \nNobel Peace surprise winner turn dissident to Mohammed ElBaradei was amongst those taking part in Alexandria 's day of departure . \nMany Muslim Brotherhood members also in the crowd . \nYou 're with CONNECT THE WORLD I 'm Becky Anderson in London . \nThere 's no doubt this uprising was all in the street reflecting the anger of average Egyptians against an oppressive regime . \nWith the inclusion of the Muslim Brotherhood has got some highly concern about what might happen post Mubarak . \nWell it 's hard to say for sure how much support the Brotherhood has . \nEgypt 's largest opposition group is officially band . \nIt does contest elections with candidates running as independents . \nIn 2005 , the Brotherhood gain about 20 percent of the seats in Parliament . \nBut this may not accurately reflect their strength as the elections were not free and fair . \nMuslim in Brotherhood has evolved over the years renouncing violence decades ago and clearly condemning groups like Al Qaeda . \nBut its principle goal remains unchanged . \nIt wants Islamic law to Egypt . \nInteresting then that it 's now teamed up with secular reformer Mohammed ElBaradei of course it does n't mean it will stay with him long - term . \nWell the New York Times reports a Brotherhood spokesman told Al Jazeera earlier in the uprising political groups support ElBaradei to negotiate with the regime . \nTuesday that same spokesman said and `` it 's too early to even discuss whether ElBaradei should lead a transitional government or whether we would join him . \nWell another Brotherhood spokesman tells CNN they 're not a political force to be feared . \nSaying , they support freedom of press and freedom of religion for all . \nWell out next guest says there is plenty of reason for alarm in Egypt secular have better get their act together . \nThis is somebody you 're going to recognize . \nAyan Hirsi Ali is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , she 's also author of Nomad and Infidel books that describe her own upbringing under Islam . \nThank you for coming tonight there 's a reason for this . \nYou were a member of the Muslim Brotherhood as a youngster . \nAYAN HIRSI ALI , AUTHOR , `` NOMAD '' AND `` INFIDEL '' : I was 15 years old and they were the only movement the individuals were offered as a moral frame walk that was familiar . \nThe individuals who came to school were of us , they were among us and they were not corrupt , they gave us life full of purpose . \nAnd compared to all the other organizations who came up with dreams about freedom , my father was a freedom fighter . \nHe was all about democracy . \nBut he and his groups were unable to agree . \nThey were unable to reach a conclusion of what it is that they wanted once they have driven away the strong man . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood invoked Allah , they invoked the prophet Muhammad , they invoked the hereafter . \nAll of that was familiar and they provided services that the states did provide and that our tribes and clans did not provide either . \nANDERSON : Say you were of the Muslim Brotherhood it has to be said has legitimized Hosni Mubarak 's regime in the west . \nThe president says if he quits the result would be chaos . \nThis is what he told ABC News last night . \nAnd a movement Brotherhood takeover that is what he says . \nWhat would a greater role then do you think for the Brotherhood mean for Egypt ? \nALI : I think Hosni Mubarak position is the fallacy of presenting the west in particularly America with the binary vision either a tyrant or -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nBut it does n't have to be that . \nSecular movement especially the liberals , I consider myself a liberal would have to organize only present to the people of Egypt their improvement on mobile regime but also the other side the shadow side of the Muslim Brotherhood . \nWhat does it mean when -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- is implemented and brought to the Egyptian people ? \nWhat will it mean for women ? \nWhat is it going to mean for religious minorities ? \nWhat is it going mean for the economy ? \nYou see a lot of people in the Arab world now demonstrating for bread and butter . \nDo you think that -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- is going to deliver ? \nThe Egyptian people have an example to learn by the history of a people like Iran . \nIf you consider the gay movement in 2009 it was not an opposition to a strong man . \nIt was a no to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- that 's the people of Iran who had voted in I think in a moment of absent mindedness in 1979 . \nANDERSON : The difference between a democracy and theocracy of course . \nA theocracy would be run by clerics . \nI did n't think anybody is suggesting the Muslim Brotherhood is suggesting that . \nAmr Moussa he 's the Secretary General of course of the Arab League , former Foreign Minister and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- of Egypt and -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- has hat into the ring as far as getting involved in the Unity Government . \nWas on CNN earlier on and when he was asked about whether people should fear the Muslim Brotherhood this is what he said and our viewers are just going to have a listen to this . \nAMRE MOUSSA , ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL : Fear that the Egypt future will be -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- within that -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- either Muslim Brotherhood or left or right . \nI would assure you that Egypt is looking forward for a more liberal future and that Egypt by nature , by the mood of its people and the mood of country will be part of the 21st Century and look for modernism and the future more than anybody thing . \nANDERSON : Liberal , modernism a group that wants to be forward thinking that 's Amr Moussa 's point here . \nHe 's trying to put to bed those fears and concerns that people have . \nWhat do you think the challenge is for the secular democrats faced with what is you know a movement that could be divisive going forward ? \nALI : Well the secular movement need to interview something that is local that is Arab that says yes to Islam but no to -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- . \nIn other words a separation of religion from politics . \nI think if they devise with the help of the west or without the help of the west but in any case I would say with the help of the west . \nIf they devise programs and institutions civic and economic institutions that can maintain that separation of church and state , they have religion and state affairs . \nThey could in the long run defeat the Muslim Brotherhood . \nThe Muslim Brotherhood offers -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- law and that is a theocracy . \nI have had votes . \nWe know from history before Khomeini was elected he was dismissed as a peaceful man and somebody was n't going to be elected . \nLook at the Taliban in Afghanistan , look at the rise of Al Qaeda . \nLook at the -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- coming to power . \nSo I think one of the things that is working for the Muslim Brotherhood is the fact that they are systematically underestimated . \nANDERSON : Many people will say they 'd only get something like 20 percent of the vote . \nYou say you think that they are systematically underestimated . \nWould you go so far as to say that they should n't be part , though , of a unity government going forward ? \nALI : I would go so far as to say , when a new constitution is devised , that clauses have to be put in the constitution , for instance , comparable to that of Kemal Ataturk 's , Turkey , that Sharia Law , or a theocracy , that that is not democratic , that that 's not constitutional . \nSo , there have to be safeguards built into the constitution to prevent a theocracy . \nBut I think , once they meet that , they should be able to take part . \nAnd I believe that , if secular groups , especially the liberal groups , if they try and offer a program of liberation and economic prosperity to the Egyptian people , they could win . \nANDERSON : Fascinating stuff . \nAyaan Hirsi Ali , always a pleasure to speak to you . \nWe thank you very much , indeed , for coming in tonight . \nWe 're following this story to the very end , but for some of our reporters on the ground , it is a struggle to stop the story from following them . \nAfter the break , we 're going to show you some of the challenges that go into tracking these remarkable events . \nAnd , of course , we 'll be live in Cairo . \nDo stay with us . \nYou 're watching CNN . \nI 'm Becky Anderson in London . \nANDERSON : Welcome back . \nYou 're watching CONNECT THE WORLD here on CNN . \nLet 's get you a check of the headlines this hour . \nTens of thousands of protesters filled Cairo 's Tahrir Square again Friday for what they called the `` Day of Departure . '' \nIt did n't live up to the billing , as President Hosni Mubarak is still in power . \nBut protesters are hopeful he 'll resign earlier than promised . \nBarack Obama says the world is watching Egypt and that the transition process must now begin . \nIn a statement a short time ago , the US president called for free and fair elections and says any negotiations must include a broad representation of the Egyptian opposition . \nThe ripple effect from the Egyptian protests is continuing across North Africa and the Middle East . \nHundreds of demonstrators in Jordan called for political reforms and an end to government corruption , although these protests were smaller than those held in previous weeks . \nAnd Australian prime minister Julia Gillard surveyed the damage from Cyclone Yasi on Friday . \nThe Australian prime minister flew into northern Queensland to promise government and military aid after the huge storm slammed into the region earlier this week . \nAnd the trading week has come to an end on Wall Street . \nDisappointing jobs numbers meant the Dow only finished slightly higher . \nThe US economy adding 36,000 jobs last month , but analysts expected more than four times that number . \nThere 's the closing figure for you , still over the 12,000 mark , so not a bad week . \nThose are your headlines this hour . \nWell , covering what 's been going on in Egypt can be dangerous . \nOur team on the ground are definitely up against it . \nBut here 's a taste of what they 've been able to deliver on Day 11 of these protests . \nIVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : CNN crews in other locations in this city overlooking Tahrir Square have been ordered by the Egyptian police not to provide live images of what 's going on in here . \nWe are doing it right now , but our neighbors at this location have warned us that suspected secret police are outside trying to get in to shut our -- potentially shut us down . \nAnd we have a report from the Al Jazeera news network that a gang of thugs raided their Cairo office today and set fire to it . \nSo , the effort to crack down on foreign media continues here in the Egyptian capital . \nARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : We are seeing the military that moved in overnight taking something of a more proactive role . \nA complete difference to what we have seen them do in the days past , where they were taking something of a neutral stance , allowing both camps to fight it out , even allowing attacks on international and local media to take place . \nThere is still great concern about the potential of violence , with many Cairo residents saying they are still remaining under self-imposed house arrest . \nThe predominant emotion throughout the capital is still fear and uncertainty . \nFREDERIK PLEITGEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT -LRB- on camera -RRB- : We 're right in front of one of the checkpoints leading into Tahrir Square . \nAnd , of course , one of the problems the protesters have , here , is getting enough food , water , and enough supplies in to keep all of these people going for such a long time . \nBecause some of them have been here for over a week . \nAnd their system is one where everybody brings a little bit and , therefore , everybody has enough to survive . \nWe are all together . \nYou have the bread , we have cheese , we all gather with the food . \nPLEITGEN : And you give other people , as well ? \nNot for us only . \nPLEITGEN : So , it 's a spirit of sharing , here , then . \nUNIDENTIFIED : That 's right , it is , yes . \nPLEITGEN : Thank you . \nAll right , so , a lot of people are actually coming in , one for the camera woman , as well , and they 're giving us and other protesters groceries , food , and bread to survive . \nANDERSON : All right , let 's bring in Ivan Watson , who is on the ground for us . \nSome of our reporting on Day 11 . \nWith 30 minutes to midnight in Cairo , Ivan , we 've been talking about the mood , and perhaps we should move on and really talk about how you 've been reporting this story . \nIt 's about as tough as it 's got , for you , I guess , in your career ? \nWATSON : No , no. . \nThe attacks on the journalists over the past three days , they 're substantial . \nEverybody I 've talked to has been harassed or had much worse occur to them . \nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists over the past few days , more than 100 incidents of journalists being attacked , detained , or having their equipment destroyed . \nThis is not a coincidence , Becky . \nANDERSON : You 're there on the balcony , now , I guess . \nI mean , do you feel comfortable in reporting now ? \nWATSON : I think among the opposition activists at the time being , the foreign media , the local media is welcomed by them , as they have been struggling to get their voices heard , both in Egypt and in the outside world . \nAnd these people have been putting their lives on the line to hold onto this patch of territory , as well . \nSo , for the time being , with these people here , we feel quite comfortable . \nIt 's a different story when you move beyond the barricades to the areas where the Egyptian secret police are operating and the pro- government , as many have taken to calling them , `` thugs , '' who have been carrying out the systematic attacks on the journalists . \nANDERSON : Yes , it is it any clearer just who is behind this intimidation at this point ? \nWATSON : No , it is n't , and I think government officials have denied even playing any kind of role in the attacks that have taken place on Cairo 's Tahrir Square over the course of the past three days . \nThey have even said that they are going to investigate who may have been behind what the vice president called was `` a conspiracy . '' \nANDERSON : Ivan Watson , there , in Cairo for you . \nIvan , we thank you very much , indeed . \nAll right , let 's move from Cairo , shall we , to the port city of Alexandria . \nAs you can see from this Google Earth image , Alexandria is roughly 200 kilometers north of the Egyptian capital , and the tensions have reached there and are exposing some divisions in society . \nNic Robertson has been talking to some local residents for you . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Inside cafes , the talk is of the violent clashes in Cairo , pausing only to watch as protesters pass by . \nA week ago , this man was one of the protesters trying to oust the president . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Inside the same cafe , anti-Mubarak activists claim pro-government factions stalking Alexandria 's streets are paid to attack them and tell me they 're not going to give up until Mubarak goes . \nBy the seafront , far from the protests , patience among this ancient city 's fishermen long since ran out . \nNet maker Ali Farhad -LRB- ph -RRB- is furious . \n`` This is wrong , '' he says . \n`` They 're destroying the country , stopping business for all the people . \nWe 're with Mubarak . \nWe need calm . '' \nHis son , Mohammed Ali is angry , too . \n`` The protesters are hurting our business and bringing armed thugs to the streets . '' \nBattle lines are being drawn , the middle ground evaporating . \nTAREK EL-TAWIL , SENIOR JUDGE : The regime is panicking , are frustrated , they do n't know what to do . \nBut never -- there have been never used to see this kind of demonstration . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Tarek el-Tawil , a senior judge , thought Mubarak was backing down , until he saw the violence in Cairo . \nNow , he says , the president should face trial for war crimes . \nEL-TAWIL : It 's against humanity , what they did yesterday . \nThey massacred -- call it a massacre . \nOf course , of course . \nWe 've seen very recently that international lawyers and stuff like that and human rights organizations will start to push , of course . \nROBERTSON -LRB- on camera -RRB- : And will that convince him to step down ? \nEL-TAWIL : Of course , of course , if they have no choice . \nROBERTSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : It 's a very , very uneasy calm . \nOver there on the corner are Mubarak loyalists waiting for anti-Mubarak demonstrators to come along , waiting for confrontation . \nSo far , at least the anti-Mubarak supporters have been able to avoid violent clashes . \nNic Robertson , CNN , Alexandria , Egypt . \nANDERSON : All right . \nSo , in the past week , we 've seen two Arab leaders vow to stand down and an entire government dismissed . \nSo , what more can protesters hope to achieve ? \nWe 're going to discuss a region in turmoil , up next . \nANDERSON : It 's about 17 minutes to midnight in Egypt . \nIn just a few short weeks , an entire region has been turned on its head , has n't it ? \nIts people are finally getting a taste of freedom , and the desire for democracy is spreading far and wide . \nIn Egypt , anti-government demonstrators forced President Hosni Mubarak to promise not to run for reelection . \nWell , their inspiration came , in part , from Tunisia , where a protest against corruption led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali . \nIn neighboring Algeria , a decades-old state of emergency will reportedly be lifted after demonstrations there . \nAnd in Jordan , public anger prompting King Abdullah II to dismiss his government and appoint a new prime minister to carry out political reforms . \nWell , after decades in power , Yemen 's president , Ali Abdullah Saleh , bowed to protesters ' demands this week and vowed not to seek reelection in 2013 . \nMass protests have been organized online in Syria , but one planned for today saw few people take to the streets . \nAnd in Sudan , students have staged a series of demonstrations over corruption and rising prices . \nSo , where is this regional unrest heading ? \nWell , I 'm happy to say I 'm joined to discuss this by CONNECT THE WORLD panelist and regular guest on this show , Fawaz Gerges . \nI do n't even have to say who you are these days , because everybody knows you as well as they know me . \nIt 's not clear , at this point , who is talking to who in Egypt , whether the military may take over , whether the president may go now , or whether he may stay through September . \nWhat is , though , clear is that the wall of fear , not just in Egypt , but across the region , has fallen and changed the very nature , the psychology of a culture , has n't it ? \nFAWAZ GERGES , INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS PROFESSOR : It really has . \nI mean , you 're talking about the barrier of fear has been removed . \nOne of the major reasons why Arab dictators have been able to dominate their populations and subjugate their population is because of the security apparatus . \nAnd that 's why you had political apathy and fear . \nWhat has happened in the last few weeks , now , is that people have become active and , basically , the barrier of fear has been removed . \nAnd you 're seeing , now , millions , not just hundreds of thousands of Arabs , now , realize they can own their future , they can determine their own history . \nANDERSON : We are seeing movements across the region , but they do n't parallel each other , do they ? \nWhat we 've seen in Syria is really sort of protest-lite , dare I call it that . \nWe see concessions by ruling parties and rulers across the region , but it 's not as big as we 've seen in Egypt or Tunisia , for example . \nGERGES : Not at all , and I think you 're absolutely correct about drawing attention to differences as well as similarities . \nTunisia is not Egypt . \nSyria is not Jordan . \nJordan is not Yemen . \nThere are some major differences . \nBut there are also similarities , and the similarities are the following , they are shared by almost every Arab state . \nFamily-based states as opposed to rational , modernizing by various states . \nAnd dismal economic conditions . \nDismal -- on average , Becky , you have on average between 40 and 50 million -- 50 and -- between 40 and 50 percent of the 300 million Arabs live either in poverty or below the poverty line . \nThe population -- take Egypt . \nIn 1952 , when the military officers carried out their coup , there were 15 million Egyptians . \nToday , you have 84 million Egyptians . \nHow do you feed , how do you educate , how do you provide for the 84 million people ? \nYou also have systems and institutional systems that have been decimated , that have been shattered . \nANDERSON : All right . \nWe know that there is change afoot , change amok , as it were . \nBut history shows , and you and I know this , and most of our viewers will know this , that removing a corrupt , authoritarian leader through people power is , to a certain extent , the easy part . \nConstructing a new system which is inclusive and transparent , with institutions that work , is much , much harder . \nGERGES : In fact , the huge challenge facing the Arab world is the morning after . \nThat is , the morning after you get rid of your dictators . \nThere are no institutions . \nWe have been talking the last few days , the Egyptian military is the most respected institution . \nIt should not be the only respected national institution . \nWhat has happened to the parliament ? \nWhat has happened to other institutions ? \nThere are no institutions . \nYou have to build institutions . \nInstitutional building , Becky , takes decades . \nHow do you feed and provide for the -- how do you create a productive base ? \nOn and on , so many difficulties and challenges . \nANDERSON : Which is , perhaps , why we have heard the rest of the world calling for an orderly transition at this point . \nThe people on the streets of Egypt want their president to go . \nWe 've seen , as we say , people protest around the region . \nBut is this orderly transition , and `` orderly , '' here , being the operative word , important at this point ? \nGERGES : Well , Becky , this is the question . \nWhat do we mean by `` orderly ? '' \nDo we mean by an orderly transition , that is the army manages the transition , the army puts its own people to replace Hosni Mubarak . \nNow you have the vice president , Omar Suleiman . \nYou have the prime minister , a military general . \nThe interior minister , and the defense minister . \nSo , what kind of ch -- the reality is , even though the challenges are massive , you have to begin somewhere . \nYou have to begin the process of institutional building . \nYou have to give people a say in their political and economic well-being . \nANDERSON : Let 's sit back . \nIt is -- we 're into the first week of February . \nWe 're into the 11th day , and just before midnight in Egypt , the 11th day of the protest in Egypt , we 've seen this wave across the region , the sort of shifting sands , dare I call it that , across the region . \nWhen you sit back and just take stock of where we are , what 's your first thought ? \nGERGES : Truly , this is historic . \nIf you had asked me a few weeks ago , I would have said never in Egypt . \nNow , what I call -- I call it the Arab anti-father . \nPeople now realize that the authoritarian role , not just the barrier of fear , has fallen . \nThis is a critical moment , because people realize they have power . \nAnd now -- and what 's beautiful about what we 're seeing , Becky , you 're not seeing American flags being burned . \nYou 're not seeing people talking about Western imperialism . \nThey 're talking about their dictators . \nThey want to take charge of their destiny . \nThis is really what matters . \nANDERSON : You just talked about the day after , the day after in the Arab world . \nDoes that worry you ? \nGERGES : A great deal . \nThere are tremendous risks . \nAnd this particular transition is not assured . \nIt will be messy , it will be prolonged , you might have some setbacks . \nBut at the end of the day , the Arab world -- the Arab world has been living under dictatorship since the end of colonialism . \nYou need to begin -- the Arab world must join what I call the democratic wave . \nThe democratic wave had just reached the Arab shores . \nIt 's a beautiful moment . \nIf the Arab -- if the Arab intellectual and political and economic elite can manage this particular transition , in two or three decades , I 'm willing to -- this would be truly -- it would transform the Arab world and the relationship between the Arab world and the West . \nOn a Friday evening in London , and at ten minutes to midnight in Egypt , Fawaz , we thank you very much , indeed , helping us out over the last couple of weeks . \nJust ahead on CONNECT THE WORLD , how scenes from the streets of Egypt are stirring up memories for one photojournalist . \nA look back at some of the famous revolts against powerful world leaders . \nYou 're with CNN , we will be back in 60 seconds with CONNECT THE WORLD . \nANDERSON : Those powerful images from Friday in Egypt . \nThere it 's seven minutes to midnight , now . \nWell , in this evening 's Parting Shots , I want to show you how Egypt 's demands are reverberating right around the world , not just in the region . \nFirst to Iran , where after Friday payers , worshipers chanted for President Mubarak 's removal . \nIn Turkey , pro-Islamic groups demonstrating in Ankara demanded an end to the ruling regime in Cairo . \nA protest in Kuala Lumpur outside the Egyptian embassy was later broken up by police using water canon . \nAnd in Paris , the group Reporters Without Borders campaigned against the attacks on journalists in Cairo . \nRegardless of age , Egypt 's protests have been gathering momentum . \nEgyptians in Prague called for the immediate resignation of Mubarak outside their embassy . \nIn South Africa , this woman marched on Pretoria with around 250 other campaigners for the president to be ousted . \nSince January the 25th , the Egyptians ' chants have been echoed across many cities . \nHere in London , a series of rallies have been held supporting the uprising . \nWhile in Rome 's Republic Square , around a hundred people gathered to show their solidarity . \nAnd in the US , many Egyptian sympathizers have been out on the streets calling for change . \nThis photo from a gathering outside the UN Egyptian mission in New York . \nWell , all of us have been watching events , have n't we , in Cairo , wondering whether , after almost 30 years of rule , Hosni Mubarak might , just might , be on his way out . \nWell , Peter Turnley is a photojournalist and colleague who told us it not only brings back memories of Mubarak 's rule , but it makes him think of all the strongmen like him that he 's photographed , all the uprisings , all the turmoil . \nTake a look at this . \nPETER TURNLEY , PHOTOJOURNALIST : Well , what has come to my mind as I have been witnessing these events unfold is that I had a photo session , a one-on-one photo session with Mubarak all the way back in 1986 , this was 25 years ago , and he has now been in power for 30 years . \nWatching these events unfold , it has occurred to me the quantity of popular revolts against authoritarian leaders . \nCeausescu , Erich Honecker , Assad , Khomeini in Iran , Saddam Hussein in Iraq , Cedras of Haiti , Baby Doc Duvalier , Fidel Castro , and the list goes on and on . \nTURNLEY : I first met Ceausescu in 1989 . \nI had a photo session for a cover of Newsweek in August of 1989 at Ceausescu 's summer house . \nIt was one of the most surreal experiences of my career . \nI pushed him around for an hour and a half in a photo session where he literally obeyed me almost like a child . \nFour months later , I found myself in his own personal office in the presidential palace in Bucharest with -- watching a television where Ceausescu 's dead face was looking up at the screen in his own office on his own set . \nTURNLEY : I recall very vividly that in 1989 , I photographed Honeker standing next to Gorbachev on a reviewing stand during the 50th anniversary of the East German state . \nThey both were laughing , chatting leisurely . \nNo one could have known , that very night in East Berlin , there were huge riots and protests by Molotov-cocktail-throwing young people against the Stasi , which was the beginning of the end of the East German regime , which folded with the fall of the Berlin Wall only several months later . \nTURNLEY : I have also experienced popular revolts that started with much passion , much enthusiasm , such as the Tiananmen Square uprising in China that was a very moving uprising of literally millions of young people that simply were expressing a desire for a better life . \nThat revolt , though , ended being crushed by military hardware when Chinese troops came into Tiananmen Square , as we all know . \nAnd the consequences of that uprising , I think , are still yet not known today , this many years later . \nTURNLEY : As Mubarak was turning to walk into the presidential palace , I simply called out to him , and I said , `` President Mubarak , my name is Peter Turnley , I 'm trying to do a photo session for Newsweek . '' \nHe turned and he said to me , `` When would you like to do it ? '' \nAnd I said , `` Right now . '' \nAnd he said , `` Let 's go . '' \nHe chose to take a stance where his hands were folded and crossed in front of him , and it was a rather proud , strong , and possibly somewhat defiant look . \nTURNLEY : It has often seemed extremely surreal that some of the world leaders I 've photographed , notorious for the iron-fisted manner in which they have held power , have been quite cooperative during a one-on-one photo session . \nWhat matters most is how they will be judged by their own people and by history for the manner in which they have wielded power , and for how their regimes have impacted the lives of the citizens of their country . \nANDERSON : Pictures that tell a story . \nI 'm Becky Anderson . \nThat is your world connected . \nThank you for watching . \nThe world headlines and , then , `` BackStory '' will follow this short break . \nYou 're watching CNN .

{"txt": "Monday 22 August 2005 00.03 BST British officials are seriously concerned about the level of corruption in the Iraqi defense ministry , after the embezzlement of vast amounts of money earmarked for the country 's security forces . \nOfficials from the British Ministry of Defense had already warned US and Iraqi authorities against the squandering of money - and have been proved right , on a catastrophic scale . \nA report compiled by the Iraqi Board of Supreme Audit has concluded that at least half , and probably more , of $ 1.27 bn -LRB- # 700m -RRB- of Iraqi money spent on military procurement has disappeared into a miasma of kickbacks and vanished middlemen - or else has been spent on useless equipment . \nThe report , leaked to the US news organization Knight Ridder , comes as a blow to the credibility of the Iraqi army and its ability to contain the increasingly cogent insurgency . \nAccording to the report , led by former human rights minister Abdel Baset al-Turki , the vanished money came solely from Iraqi funds , not from foreign donations to Iraq 's military or the US-funded training budget . \nThe report focuses on an eight-month period after the transfer of sovereignty from the US-led occupation to caretaker Iraqi authorities on June 28 2004 . \nThe report found that contracts were awarded to favored weapons suppliers , via middlemen , without bidding or approval from the prime minister 's office . \nContracts included a clause stating that the full value of deals was to be paid up front , in cash . \nAll deals were done through third-party companies or agencies headed by Iraqi middlemen , who have disappeared , leaving the Iraqi government without recourse when it complained of unfulfilled contracts . \nInternal documents , said the report , `` incorrectly indicated that the -LRB- Iraqi -RRB- ministry of defense signed contracts with Poland , Arab countries , the United States and Europe , but we discovered that all contracts were signed and executed with Iraqi suppliers '' . \nAmong those missing is a man called Nair Mohamed al-Jumaili , sole beneficiary of 43 out of 89 contracts , into whose bank account several million dollars was paid . \nNine ministry officials , all of them appointed by the US , have been fired by the ministry , and face possible criminal charges . \nAmong them is the ministry 's procurement chief , Ziad Cattan . \nMr Cattan , who returned to Iraq two days before the war began , contacted Knight Ridder from hiding , to deny the charges and the claims that he took a 10 % finder 's fee on every contract . \nHe said the Americans controlled the purse strings of Iraqi defense expenditure . \nDuring the period covered by the report , 20 US officials worked alongside the Iraqi defense ministry , and all the sacked officials had been appointed by the Coalition Provisional Authority - the administration headed by American Paul Bremer . \nBritish defense officials say that `` ultimately , Iraqi spending decisions are a matter for the Iraqi government '' . \nAdditional reporting by Jason Rodrigues Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian .

{"txt": "Thursday 12 May 2005 12.21 BST George Galloway , the newly elected MP for the anti-war Respect party in east London , this morning faces allegations from the US Senate over whether he benefited from the Iraq oil-for-food program run under Saddam Hussein . \nA US Senate committee report published today claims to have uncovered `` significant evidence '' that the former Labor MP was allocated millions of barrels of oil from the Saddam regime . \nIt bases its conclusions on previously disclosed documents from the Iraqi ministry of oil and interviews with senior officials of the regime , plus unnamed Iraqi sources . \nLast night said that claim was `` preposterous `` . \n`` I do not own any such companies . \nHe told the Guardian : `` This committee has never spoken to me , never written to me and never asked me a single question and did not even acknowledge last year my offer to go and speak to them . \nIt is hardly an investigation . \n`` It is merely the repetition of false accusations that have been made and denied before . \nSomething does not become true because it is repeated by George Bush 's Senate majority . '' \nThe US report concludes : `` The evidence obtained by the sub-committee , including Hussein-era documents from the ministry of oil and testimony from senior Hussein officials , shows that Iraq granted George Galloway allocations for millions of barrels of oil under the oil-for-food program . \n`` Moreover , some evidence indicates that Galloway appeared to use a charity for children 's leukemia to conceal payments associated with at least one such allocation . '' \nLast night 's report was produced by the staff of the Senate 's permanent subcommittee on investigations , part of the committee on homeland security and government affairs . \nThe subcommittee is chaired by Norm Coleman , a Minnesota Republican , who has made it his mission to bring to book those he considers responsible for the Iraqi oil-for-food scandal . \nIn December he called for the resignation of the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan . \nMr Galloway said last night that the oil allocation vouchers were given to a Jordanian businessman , Fawaz Zureikat , who was chairman of his Mariam Appeal , a charity he set up to help a young Iraqi girl suffering from leukemia . \nThe MP said the appeal , part of a campaign against United Nations sanctions in Iraq , has already been investigated by the Charity Commission and no impropriety had been found . \n`` In other words , no money ended up in my pocket , '' Mr Galloway said . \nLast week Mr Galloway won a sensational victory against Labor 's Oona King in Bethnal Green . \nHe has consistently denied that he personally profited from Iraqi oil sales . \nHe won a high court libel action against the Daily Telegraph relating to similar allegations . \nThe US Senate committee report says it based its conclusions on documents from the Iraqi oil ministry , distinct from those alleged foreign ministry papers relied upon by the Telegraph . \n`` The documents presented in this report have no relation to those discussed in the Daily Telegraph piece . '' \nIn the course of the libel trial , Mr Galloway said he had never received or traded in oil , diverted money from the oil-for-food program , or used the Mariam Appeal as a front for his own personal gain . \nThe Senate committee report says that in April 2005 the vice-president of Iraq , Taha Yassin Ramadan , told the committee that Mr Galloway had been granted oil allocations `` because of his opinions about Iraq '' and because Mr Galloway `` wanted to lift the embargo against Iraq '' . \nAnother official , the report alleges , told investigators from the US Treasury that `` a member of the British parliament benefited tremendously from the illegal trade of oil by Iraq '' . \nThe report said : '' -LRB- The Source -RRB- stated that George Galloway , Labor Party , was the owner of a company that was involved in the Iraqi oil trade scheme .

{"txt": "By Shelley DuBois , reporterFebruary 7 , 2011 : 5:46 AM ET FORTUNE -- As the political unrest in Egypt continues , corporate America is watching and holding its breath . \nAlready , many companies with operations in Egypt have had to adjust . \nProcter & Gamble -LRB- PG , Fortune 500 -RRB- , for example , had to close its Cairo facilities and evacuate foreign national employees . \nThe protest is affecting the worldwide commodities markets too -- oil prices spiked to $ 100 this week and have stayed high on the assumption that the conflict in Egypt could disrupt crucial oil transit routs . \nWhile most companies are concerned about the transit routes in and out of the country , several are producing energy in Egypt now . \nThey 're exposed to risk right now , since the consequences of political upheaval are unpredictable , and could possibly reach energy assets far from the protest in Cairo . \nYet , so far , they 're neither overly worried , nor should they be : Things for energy companies working in Egypt are n't bad . \nOne independent , Apache Corp -LRB- APA , Fortune 500 -RRB- , has a large stake in Egypt -- about 21 % of the company 's total assets are there , according to an analyst report by HSBC Global Research . \nApache 's stock took a hit on Thursday dropping by about 4.7 % based on news about the conflict , paired with the company 's decision to shut down its Australian oil fields because of hurricanes there . \nThe conflict in Egypt could of course hurt Apache , but it probably wo n't . \nIf it does , it 's unlikely to damage the company in any lasting way . \nApache is still producing from its assets in Egypt , and therefore still raking in a profit from them . \nWhile that could change , there 's a good chance that the independent oil company will continue production during the upheaval and emerge relatively unscathed . \nIn fact , as is typical in equities , one investor 's panic is another 's opportunity : Several analysts claim that the drop in Apache 's stock price due to concern over Apache 's large stake in Egypt created an opportunity to buy newly undervalued Apache stock . \nApache has over 11 million acres in Egypt that produced over 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during 2009 . \nMost of the Apache 's oil fields are in Egypt 's Western Desert , many , over a hundred miles from the conflict in Cairo . \nWhile national conflict can spread anywhere , the biggest threat to Apache depends on the government . \nApache has ties to the government that 's currently getting overthrown , since its partner in Egyptian projects is a company called the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation , is a national oil company . \nThat does create some risk for the company . \nExperts say that Apache 's worst-case scenario would be that the current government gets overthrown and the new regime would nationlize all of Apache 's assets . \nBut that probably wo n't happen . \nIn times of conflict , `` generally speaking , one of the things most nations want to do is keep the energy flowing , in order to meet its demand , '' says John Kollar , an analyst with HSBC . \nApache is crucial to Egypt , according to a UBS Investment Research report . \nThe company drills half of the wells in the country , employs between 4,000 and 5,000 Egyptians and pays over $ 11 million per day to the national treasury . \nWhoever takes charge of the country probably would n't want to put the brakes on such a key source of energy and income . \nIt 's a basic point , but oil , in general , is extremely profitable . \nRight now , Egyptian oil is still coming out of the ground , which means that Apache will profit . \nIn fact , Apache would have to shut down all production in Egypt for a full three months before seeing any negative impact on its credit quality , says Kollar , which does n't appear likely . \nHe takes a longer-term approach to evaluating a company 's stability . \n`` I 'm not all that worried about the next penny per share , I 'm looking at ten and twenty-year bonds and the company 's ability to pay interest and its level of credit-worthiness . '' \nIn that respect , he says , `` Apache is one of the best independent exploration and production companies from credit-worthiness point of view . '' \nMost big oil companies , in fact , are more resilient than the market would reflect . \nCompanies such as Apache and certainly the major energy companies have a plethora of assets all over the globe . \nIf they need to , they can sell them and spend expend less capital and stay financially solvent . \n`` The market 's reaction is always to shoot first and ask questions later , '' Kollar says . \nBut that 's not the best reflection of the health of energy companies with such long-term contracts that encounter may encounter obstacles but ultimately generate a big profit . \nApache 's stock has started to creep back since it plummeted last week and has kept producing throughout the turmoil . \nEnergy plays everywhere are becoming increasingly risky . \nExploration and production companies are partnering with government-linked oil companies where volatile tax and export rules , if not political conflict , are real possibilities . \nIf the market continues to overreact , then recover , it 'll keep providing investors an opportunity to buy shares of certain energy companies with short-term obstacles and long-term profit plans . \nMarket indexes are shown in real time , except for the DJIA , which is delayed by two minutes . \nAll times are ET . \nDisclaimer LIBOR Warning : Neither BBA Enterprises Limited , nor the BBA LIBOR Contributor Banks , nor Reuters , can be held liable for any irregularity or inaccuracy of BBA LIBOR . \nMorningstar : 2013 Morningstar , Inc. . \nDisclaimer The Dow Jones IndexesSM are proprietary to and distributed by Dow Jones & Company , Inc. and have been licensed for use . \nAll content of the Dow Jones IndexesSM 2013 is proprietary to Dow Jones & Company , Inc. . \nThe market data is the property of Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. and its licensors . \nFactSet Research Systems Inc. 2013 . \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS .

{"txt": "Analysis : Revolt in Libya likely to scar its oil sector NEW YORK | Thu Feb 24 , 2011 10:24 am EST NEW YORK -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Regardless of what comes next in Libya 's lethal political standoff , the OPEC country 's oil sector is nearly certain to suffer , bringing long-lasting supply disruptions or even permanent damage . \nNone of several potential outcomes is benign for Libya 's oil industry -- the lifeblood of its economy -- or for oil prices . \nThe scenarios run the gamut from all-out civil war and attacks on energy infrastructure to low-level neglect and reservoir damage , as foreign expertise flees the country . \nOver decades , from Iran , to Iraq and Venezuela , periods of political chaos in OPEC countries have usually carved lasting scars on the oil sector , and few expect Libya to be any different . \n`` A period of chaos will probably interrupt Libya 's refining and oil operations , '' said Amy Jaffe , an energy studies fellow and Middle East expert at Rice University in Houston . \n`` The military is abandoning Gaddafi , so it 's unclear who is left to protect oil installations . \nLots of foreigners are being evacuated , so who will remain in place capable of operating Libya 's oil industry ? \nWill workers even show up ? '' \nAs Africa 's No. 3 producer and the site of the continent 's largest proved reserves , estimated at 44 billion barrels , Libyan oil usually accounts for 2 percent of world output . \nThe country , whose oil accounts for a fourth of Italy 's demand , is the first major oil exporter to be thrust into acute turmoil since protests began sweeping through the Middle East in January , unseating presidents in Tunisia and Egypt so far . \nAn estimated 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of Libya 's 1.6 million bpd of production has been halted , as companies evacuate staff and suspend operations , according to the latest Reuters calculations . \nMuch of the country 's oil industry is run by foreign firms including Eni and Repsol , while Libya 's National Oil Corporation -LRB- NOC -RRB- has traditionally been tightly controlled by Gaddafi . \nLibyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi defiantly pledged on Tuesday to stay in power at any cost , threatening to have protesters hunted down and killed `` house by house . '' \nWith rival factions already laying claim to an oil-rich swath of eastern Libya , separated by hundreds of miles of desert from capital Tripoli in the west , the country could even face civil war , analysts warned . \nIn OPEC countries where oil infrastructure is the ultimate key to power and purse strings , war and other major political crises have typically resulted in supply disruptions that take years or decades to bounce back from . \nIran 's 1979 revolution cut the country 's output by more than half , and production never recovered fully . \nIraq 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait ultimately slashed output in both countries for years , and ravaged Kuwaiti oil wells . \nVenezuela 's massive oil industry strike of 2002 crippled production , which has never returned to pre-strike levels . \nTo be sure , OPEC 's top producer Saudi Arabia has stepped in to boost production in previous disruptions in other member producers , and the Saudi oil minister said on Tuesday the cartel , led by the kingdom , stands ready to pump more oil , but only when needed . \nU.S. officials say Saudi Arabia could replace Libyan supplies within a month , although it would leave less available spare capacity . \nLibya 's unrest has helped push Brent crude oil prices up nearly 6 percent since Friday , touching a 2-1\\/2 - year high of nearly $ 109 a barrel , although the surge also reflects the chance that chaos will affect other oil-exporting countries . \nBrent rose $ 2.64 to $ 108.42 a barrel on Wednesday . \n`` The output of -LRB- Libya 's -RRB- oil will probably not be completely halted , but it is difficult to see this level of chaos failing to result in significant operational disruptions , '' Eurasia Group analysts said in a note on Tuesday . \n`` It is likely that the country will experience a prolonged period of violent instability , with a potential for full blown civil war . '' \nAs the revolt aimed at ending Gaddafi 's 41-year rule intensifies , oil infrastructure could enter the power play . \nUnlike in major African exporters Nigeria and Angola where oil is mostly offshore , installations are mostly on land in Libya , making them potentially more vulnerable . \n`` This effectively gives the country two political factions , two energy-producing basins , two oil output infrastructures . \nEconomically at least , the seeds of protracted conflict -- regardless of what happens with Gaddafi or any political changes after he departs - have already been sown , '' said political risk consultancy Stratfor . \nWith oil companies scrambling to pull personnel from the country , Libya 's oil industry `` will have to operate under difficult circumstances . \nA sustained lack of security will keep foreign oil companies at bay for a while , '' said energy consultancy PFC in a note . \nAs yet , there are no reports of attacks on energy infrastructure , but eastern tribal leaders have threatened to shut off exports , revenue from which usually flows to capital Tripoli , Gaddafi 's increasingly tenuous stronghold in the west . \nNearby , an underwater gas line to Italy has already been interrupted . \nThe fact that Libya is cutting exports of refined products may indicate workers are already abandoning the country 's refineries and their highly explosive plants out of fear . \nA Time Magazine intelligence columnist wrote on Tuesday that Gaddafi himself may be ordering sabotage attacks on oil pipelines leading to the Mediterranean Sea , citing a source in the region . \nAt Libyan oil wells , which are mostly in remote desert areas , any abrupt halt could permanently damage infrastructure and compromise it for years . \n`` Anybody who feels they could still control the infrastructure in the future will probably not try to blow it up , '' said Jaffe . \n`` But companies , including the Libyan national oil company , may face a tough decision . \nWill they try for orderly shutdowns that ensure production can resume easily later , or keep fields going but risk events that could damage them ?

'' \nThe attack that began Thursday , he speculated , was intended to regain control of Rayayna , population 12,000 . \nResidents east of the town had `` declared their support for the rebels a month ago , '' he said , while the rest of the town remains loyal to Gadhafi and his former head of internal security , Nasar al Mabout . \nHajj Usama said al Mabout lives there . \nSince the raids began , Hajj Usama said , he has lost contact with rebels in Rayayna with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to Zintan after his house was destroyed in the shelling . \nAs dusk fell Friday the shelling visible earlier from the roofs of Zintan abated . \nBut shortly before 10 p.m. , the attack resumed with sporadic barrages of gunfire . \nThe rebels said the night shelling may have been intended to terrorize Zintan 's residents so they would flee . \nSome have , but most were staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over , Hajj Usama said . \nEarly Friday , NATO jets pounded Libyan ports , destroying eight of Gadhafi 's warships , an alliance spokesman said . \nNATO targeted the ships in Tripoli , Al-Khums and Sirte after it was apparent that Gadhafi 's forces were increasingly using naval vessels to launch attacks on civilians , said Mike Bracken , NATO 's military spokesman . \nGadhafi was indiscriminately mining waters in Misrata and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid , Bracken said . \n`` He was using maritime forces to lay mines . \nThese were legal targets , '' Bracken said at a briefing in Brussels , Belgium . \nHe did not say whether crew members were aboard when the ships were hit . \nThe NATO campaign is progressing and Gadhafi 's combat power had been severely curtailed , Bracken said . \nBut the Libyan leader 's forces continued their heavy shelling of Dehiba , on the Tunisian border , where thousands of refugees have amassed in recent weeks . \nThe border crossing , through which humanitarian aid is often trucked in , was closed Friday . \nAlong the southern borders , rebels had gained control of border crossings between Libya and Sudan and Libya and Chad and had regained control of Kufra in the southeast , according to a report by the International Medical Corps , which has teams in Libya and Tunisia . \nThe global medical organization said rebel control along the Chad border was significant because supplies flow through there to Gadhafi 's forces . \n`` While control of the entire border will be difficult , the rebels are reported to have a large force in the region , '' it said . \n`` The Niger and Morocco border crossings remain under Gadhafi control . '' \nMeanwhile , the African Union announced it will hold a two-day meeting of heads of state in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa next week to address the conflict in Libya , as well as other security issues in Africa . \nIn another development , the family of South African freelance photojournalist Anton Hammerl , who has been missing in Libya since April , said late Thursday they believe he was killed by Libyan government forces . \nThe statement was posted on the `` Free photographer Anton Hammerl '' Facebook page and followed interviews given in The New York Times , Global Post and The Atlantic by two journalists who said they were with him when he was shot . \n`` On 5 April 2011 , Anton was shot by Gaddafi 's forces in an extremely remote location in the Libyan desert . \nAccording to eyewitnesses , his injuries were such that he could not have survived without medical attention , '' according to the Facebook statement . \nHammerl was last reportedly seen in a remote region of the Libyan desert . \nHe was reportedly captured by Gadhafi 's forces near the town of al-Brega , a key oil town in eastern Libya , that has been the site of intense fighting .

'' \nAbout 45,000-50 ,000 people have died since Tuesday 's 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Haiti 's capital , Port-au-Prince and 300,000 have been made homeless , according to UN estimates . \nThe Pan American Health Organization has estimated that the death toll could be as high as 100,000 . \nMs Willmott , Labor MEP for the East Midlands , said : `` Yes , people will die here this winter , even though the Labor government set up a welfare state that spends billions to help prevent too many deaths . '' \nShe added : `` Our government and local councils are quite rightly funded to do all they can to help everyone suffering from the cold . \n`` But I am also proud that our government will do all it can to help the people in Haiti and I totally support all the work done by the charities to get supplies out there as soon as possible . '' \nSending aid to rioting ingrates while our own people die is stinking elite hypocrisy Mr Griffin , MEP for North West England , responded with another Twitter post , saying : `` Individuals should give whatever they feel appropriate , but Britain is bankrupt . \nFifty thousands pensioners will die ... of cold this winter . \n`` Boys get blown to bits because we ca n't afford to armor their Land Rovers ... Sending aid to rioting ingrates while our own people die is stinking elite hypocrisy . '' \nAsked about Mr Griffin 's comments , BNP deputy leader Simon Darby criticised the government 's # 6m contribution to the aid effort in Haiti . \nHe said : `` I 'd rather see that # 6m that we spent keeping our own people alive . \nYou look after your own first . \n`` If they 've got surplus money to give away to Haiti - how many people have died because we did n't have the infrastructure to grit the roads ?

{"txt": "Tuesday 19 April 2005 08.43 BST Marla Ruzicka , who has been killed by a car bomber near Baghdad airport , was an extraordinary , one-person American aid agency , who worked tirelessly to get compensation for victims of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . \nThough only 28 when she died , she was an unusual mixture of charm , ebullience , adventure-seeking and tireless dedication to helping ordinary people whose lives had been shattered . \nShe lobbied journalists and diplomats with equal persistence , but loved nothing better than to sit with wretched families after the spotlight had moved on , record every detail of their stories , go out and campaign for official apologies and compensation - and then stay in touch to keep them informed . \nOn the day she died , on Iraq 's most dangerous road , she had been out talking to bereaved families . \nMarla had been driving her husband , Salim Ruzicka , 35 , from San Francisco to Baghdad with her . \nAn unemployed pilot when she hired him , he had started flying for Iraq Air again , and , as the father of a two-month-old daughter , wanted to give up the danger of his work with Marla . \nBut she was due to leave Baghdad this week , and he stayed on out of loyalty . \nThey were driving , by chance , near a convoy of foreign contractors ' vehicles , which were the bomber 's target . \nDressed in a long black abbaya , the head-to-toe covering which most western women now wear in Baghdad as protection , Marla used an ordinary car . \nLooking like a teenager - and with her bubbly enthusiasm and girlish shriek of a laugh - she was not always taken seriously when she arrived in her first big war zone , Afghanistan , just after the Taliban were ousted in December 2001 . \nUnlike most aid workers , she cultivated journalists , and wanted to know where the next party was . \nBut her commitment to getting help for the forgotten was ferocious . \nOne of her first actions in Kabul was to help organise a visit by American women who had lost family members on 9\\/11 . \nThey wanted to meet Afghan families whose homes had been destroyed by American bombs . \nMarla campaigned relentlessly by telephone and email , as well as by personal lobbying , and persuaded US Senator Patrick Leahy to put an amendment into a foreign aid bill to give $ 2.5 m for Afghan victims . \nIt was not described as compensation , since the US did not wish to take formal responsibility , but Marla visited families all over Afghanistan , drew up lists of names , and helped to ensure that the money was distributed to the right people . \nIn Afghanistan , she was working for Global Exchange , a non-governmental organization based in San Francisco . \nAfter the Iraq war , she created her own charity , CIVIC -LRB- Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict -RRB- . \nOne aim was to keep a running account of the number of civilian deaths , but it quickly became an effort to help individuals . \nIn an essay sent to Human Rights Watch shortly before she died , Marla wrote : `` A number is important not only to quantify the cost of the war , but , to me , each number is also a story of someone whose hopes , dreams and potential will never be realized , and who left behind a family . '' \nShe continued her lobbying and got $ 20m for victims in Iraq . \nShe also developed contacts in the US military , trying to get them to describe otherwise unreported incidents , and take responsibility . \nIn a typical entry from her journal , published on AlterNet on November 6 2003 , she reported : `` On October 24 , former teacher Mohammad Kadhum Mansoor , 59 , and his wife , Hamdia Radhi Kadhum , 45 , were traveling with their three daughters - Beraa , 21 , Fatima , 8 , and Ayat , 5 - when they were tragically run over by an American tank . \n`` A grenade was thrown at the tank , causing it to lose control and veer on to the highway , over the family 's small Volkswagen . \nMohammad and Hamdia were killed instantly , orphaning the three girls in the back seat . \nThe girls survived , but with broken and fractured bodies . \nWe are not sure of Ayat 's fate ; her backbone is broken . \n`` CIVIC staff member Faiz Al Salaam monitors the girls ' condition each day . \nNobody in the military or the US army has visited them , nor has anyone offered to help this very poor family . '' \nBorn in the small town of Lakeport , California , Marla became politically active at the age of 15 , when she was suspended from high school for leading a protest against the first Gulf war . \nWhile at Long Island University , she traveled extensively , visiting Cuba , Guatemala , southern Africa and the West Bank . \nShe was already working as a volunteer for Global Exchange . \nDespite her exuberant exterior , she was not always happy , and her activism was sometimes both an obsession and a therapy . \nFor exercise in Baghdad , she regularly stormed up and down the pool at the al Hamra hotel , the headquarters of the newspapers which preferred not to have large , guarded villas . \nLast new year 's eve , she emailed friends : `` 2005 is going to rock for you all and me too ... I write to you from the Himalayan mountains , where I am on a seven-day trek . \nWow , is my mind clear , and I have many goals for 2005 . \nAfter my trek , I 'll work on a campaign to protect Nepalese activists - there have been over 3,000 disappearances here - more than Colombia . \nThen I am off to Afghanistan to check on the families who lost loved ones in Operation Enduring Freedom . '' \nMarla had also been planning to spend more time fundraising in the US . \nShe had an initial grant from George Soros 's Open Society Institute , but wanted to develop more sources . \nAfter the Iraq election in January , she decided to make another trip to Baghdad . \nMedea Benjamin , her original mentor at Global Exchange , tried to dissuade her because of the increased danger . \n`` I thought it would be better to wait for a while and see if the situation got better than to put her life at risk , '' she told the Los Angeles Times . \n`` She was determined to go because the people she worked with did n't have the luxury not to be at risk .

{"txt": "Friday , June 18 , 2010 ; 3:17 PM LONDON -- British newspapers and commenters turned on President Obama , members of Congress and Americans in general Friday as they denounced the treatment of BP chief executive Tony Hayward by a House investigative panel . \nResponding to what they variously described as a `` savage grilling , '' a hypocritical spectacle and even a `` Stalinist show trial , '' tabloids bristled at perceived anti-British sentiment in Thursday 's hearing on the BP oil spill disaster by a subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce . \nBritish politicians , for their part , generally steered clear of the controversy . \nBut one senior member of Prime Minister David Cameron 's government expressed sympathy for the Obama administration . \n \n`` I think the rest of the world , particularly in parts of the tabloid press , a strong- mindeded lobby which would like us to re-fight the American War of Independence , '' he said . \nWhile `` some of the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- rhetoric is clearly over the top , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague `` did n't find it was anti-British and reported back on that , '' Huhne said \nSpeaking live on the BBC 's current affairs show `` Question Time , '' Huhne took a swipe at tabloids lamenting the alleged anti-British rhetoric coming out of Washington . \n`` I recognize there is , particularly in parts of the tabloid press , a strong lobby which would like us to re-fight the American War of Independence , '' he said . \nWhile `` some of the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- rhetoric is clearly over the top , '' British Foreign Secretary William Hague `` did n't find it was anti-British and reported back on that , '' Huhne said . \n`` But it is clearly anti-BP and anti-big oil for the understandable reasons that this is an environmental catastrophe which has cost lives and livelihoods . '' \nCameron came to BP 's defense Thursday during a visit to Brussels , calling the British oil giant `` an important multinational company '' that is not only vital to Britain but is `` also important , I would argue , to the United States . '' \nHe said BP `` recognizes that it has huge obligations and it will have to spend a huge amount of money '' to contain and plug its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico , clean up the spill and pay appropriate compensation . \nBut tabloids and their readers lashed out over what they described as the six-hour interrogation of Hayward by grandstanding congressmen . \nLondon 's Daily Mail said Hayward , a 53-year-old British geologist who has been chief executive of BP for three years , `` was subjected to a grilling so savage yesterday that it was more like ancient Rome than Capitol Hill . '' \nIt said the `` hapless boss and his company '' were treated like `` Public Enemy No. 1 . '' \nHayward `` was always going to get a caning from U.S. congressmen playing to the gallery , '' the Daily Express said in an editorial . \n`` Cheap lines about taking his ` golden parachute back to England ' revealed the anti-British prejudice that was at work . '' \nThe editorial continued : `` The insatiable demand for oil of the American lifestyle is what has prompted the need for so much inherently risky deep-water drilling . \nUntil the Americans take action to curtail this demand then their complaints amount to nothing more than the squealing of hypocrites . '' \nA news story in the paper said Thursday 's hearing `` took on the style of a Stalinist show trial . '' \nIt quoted Richard Branson , the British magnate who chairs the Virgin Group , as accusing Obama of `` unseemly behavior '' for repeatedly `` kicking a company while it was on its knees . '' \nBranson said BP `` deserves to be criticized , '' but that so do U.S. government regulators . \nThe Sun joined the indignant reporting . \nThe paper 's business editor wrote that the hearing had a `` distasteful anti-British feel . '' \nBritish actress Helen Mirren also took some flak in the British press Friday for criticizing BP on the `` Late Show '' with David Letterman . \nWriting in the Daily Express , columnist James Delingpole said Mirren 's `` treachery '' would not be easily forgiven . \n`` She has ganged up with President Obama in his cheaply xenophobic and quite appallingly unfair campaign to make out that the BP oil spill is somehow Britain 's fault , '' he said . \nDaily Mail columnist Philip Norman agreed : `` One might have thought that a Dame of the British Empire who has portrayed the Queen -LRB- and , in many American eyes , is almost inseparable from her -RRB- would try in some graceful , light-hearted way to counteract the decidedly anti-British rhetoric coming from a grandstanding President Obama . '' \nOnline commenters weighed in with more criticism . \n`` So these are the rulers of the most powerful nation on earth , '' a `` Mr. Grimsdale '' wrote on the Daily Mail 's Web site . \n`` I think the rest of us should be worried , very worried by this bunch of ignorant potato heads with their fingers on the nuclear button . '' \nOn the Sun 's Web site , a writer named `` dispondant '' complained : `` It was an accident for god 's sake . \nDo the yanks think it was done on purpose ... Obama needs to back off & let BP get on with the job in hand they dont need a prat of a president posturing about & getting in the way .

JOHN BOEHNER -LRB- R -RRB- , HOUSE SPEAKER : Glad to be here with you . \nPARKER : All right . \nLet 's cut straight to the State of the Union address last night . \nThe president kept saying this is a Sputnik moment . \nWhat kind of moment would you say we 're in right now ? \nBOEHNER : Well , if you really want to talk about what the Sputnik moment is , it 's the fact that we 're broke . \nBOEHNER : The American people know we 're broke and they want us to do something about spending . \nAnd there was n't much talk last night about cutting spending and getting our debt under control . \nPARKER : And would you cut Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security ? \nBOEHNER : If we lead with our chin , nothing happens . \nThat 's what 's happened in Washington for the last 25 years . \nI think that we need to have both parties working together to help explain to the American people the size of the problem and an array of possible solutions and out of that conversation we 'll begin to resolve what is possible . \nPARKER : All right . \nWell , let 's just focus on one piece of it . \nLet 's look at Social Security . \nSpeaker Boehner , you have said that you would support or consider supporting raising the retirement age for Social Security . \nWould you go on record tonight and say that you will do that ? \nBOEHNER : I do n't -- I made a mistake when I did that because I think having the conversation about how big the problem is is the first step . \nAnd once the American people understand how big the problem is , then you can begin to outline an array of possible solutions . \nBut when you look at life expectancy in America today and you look at the Social Security system , we 're all living far longer than anyone had ever anticipated and the result of these big demographic changes is having a disastrous effect on the Social Security program . \nAnd so raising the retirement age or considering it is something that ought to be on the table . \nPARKER : OK , so raising the retirement age is on the table . \nAnd you keep saying -- Speaker Boehner , you keep talking about an adult conversation . \nAnd nobody really -- yes , we have to have one . \nEveryone I 've talked to , I ca n't -- most people say , look , even -- Obama 's plans , even the plans that the Republicans have put forward , there 's really no way to get out of this economic mess without these drastic spending cuts that we 're talking about , cutting back on entitlements but also raising taxes . \nUltimately are we going to have to raise taxes ? \nBOEHNER : Raising taxes is the wrong prescription for where we are . \nIt 's pretty clear to me the cutting of spending is the most important thing we can do to get the American people back to work . \nThat and eliminating a lot of the uncertainty of this coming out of this administration . \nThe most important thing we can do to increase federal revenues is to get the American people back to work . \nWhether they 're taking care of themselves , their families and back on the tax rolls helping to supply income to the federal government to meet the demands of the American people . \nYou 're not going to get people back to work by taxing the very people that we expected to reinvest in our economy . \nPARKER : Now we are talking about a debt and deficit of enormous proportions and I do n't know how you can cut enough without also raising taxes . \nBOEHNER : You ca n't raise -- PARKER : Believe me , I do n't want to pay more taxes . \nBOEHNER : You do n't -- you ca n't raise enough to solve the problem . \nAnd you ca n't spend -- you ca n't cut enough spending to solve this problem . \nTwo things have to happen if we 're serious . \nWe 've got to hold the line on spending and we have to get the American people back to work . \nPARKER : Last night after the State of the Union address , Michele Bachmann got up and gave her own response . \nNow she did this without consulting you . \nYou 're the most powerful man in the House of Representatives certainly and one of the top -- most powerful men in the nation . \nAnd she decides to go out on her own and give a response . \nAre you able to manage these people ? \nBOEHNER : Well , the official -- the official response was given by Paul Ryan , who 's chosen by Senator McConnell and I , to give our response . \nBut understand that every member of Congress , Democrat and Republican , does a response to the State of the Union . \nI mean in years past I 've been on a number of TV shows , I 've done a number radio programs back in my district . \nEveryone does something to respond to the State of the Union . \nShe decided to do hers in front of a Tea Party group . \nPARKER : But the Tea Party people can be a little unruly at times , ca n't they ? \nBOEHNER : Well , if you look at what the Tea Party folks were saying , it was n't any different than what the rest of America was saying . \nThat spending is out of control and we 've got to get our economy moving again to get people back to work . \nPARKER : Speaker Boehner , do n't the American people want you to work with the president and with the Democrats to find common ground and solve these problems ? \nBOEHNER : Well , clearly , and we are going to find common ground . \nI 'm not going to say it 's going to be easy but we 're going to find some way to find common ground in cutting spending . \nThe president talked about tax reform last night and I think there are ways where we can simplify both the corporate tax code and the personal tax code . \nAnd I 'm optimistic that we can work together on that . \nPARKER : Could you get that down to one page , please ? \nThat tax bill , that tax reform ? \nI want one page . \nBOEHNER : You and I and every American would love to have that . \nPARKER : You 've been -- you 've come from -- as you said , you had sort of a -- not a privileged upbringing and now you are speaker . \nPARKER : Of the House . \nAnd last night the president recognized you as sort of symbolizing the American dream . \nSo let 's take a look at that . \nBARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : We may have different backgrounds but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible , no matter who you are . \nNo matter where you come from . \nThat dream is why I can stand here before you tonight . \nThat dream is why a working class kid from Scranton can sit behind me . \nThat dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father 's Cincinnati bar can preside as speaker of the House in the greatest nation on earth . \nPARKER : So how did that feel ? \nBOEHNER : It was a nice moment for Joe and I and for the president . \nBut I think it gives -- it gives every American the opportunity to look up and say , hey , you know , they can do it , I can do it . \nSPITZER : When we come back Speaker Boehner finally explains exactly why he did n't go to the state dinner with the Chinese president last week . \nHas he rethought his decision ? \nDo n't go away . \nWe 'll be right back . \nSPITZER : Now more of Kathleen 's exclusive interview with speaker of the House John Boehner on why he 's been spurning the president 's invitations and how he felt when he heard about the Tucson shootings . \nPARKER : Speaker Boehner , despite your new position in life , your new elevated place , you seem to me to be a little shy nonetheless . \nMaybe a bit of an introvert like me . \nYou do n't like to go to parties much . \nYou do n't even like to go to state dinners . \nBOEHNER : Now , listen , I 've been to one state dinner in 20 years . \nIt 's just not -- the idea of putting on a tuxedo and sitting in a room for a long boring night , that 's not my idea of a nice evening . \nPARKER : Well , none of us really likes to sit in a boring room all night , but , you know , you turned down the state dinner with China 's President Hu Jintao . \nBOEHNER : I was meeting with him the next day . \nI was hosting him here in the Capitol and I really did n't see any reason to have -- to go have dinner the night before and then host a meeting up here the next day . \nI knew I was going to have my chance to talk to him . \nPARKER : So you do n't want to see people two days in a row ? \nPARKER : Do you not feel , though , as speaker of the House that you have a duty to show up to some of these functions just because of that 's who you are ? \nBOEHNER : Apparently a lot of people think that I do , and so maybe the next time I 'll reconsider . \nPARKER : You have an idea about what the House needs to be . \nI know you wanted to restore honor to the House as you see it . \nTell us about that . \nBOEHNER : Well , the Congress is broken and I think most Americans realize that Congress is broken . \nAnd over the last five or 10 years , it 's been evident to me that we 're moving in the wrong direction . \nYou know , in the last few years there were about five members who decided what the beginning of the bill looked like and the same five members who decided what the end of the bill was going to look like , coerced the process to achieve an outcome while 430 of us , each representing 650,000 people , we sat on the sidelines . \nAnd I gave a speech on the floor of the House in 1991 . \nI had been here about six months and they had to bring in a bill to the floor under a close rule , and I said this . \nI said , what do we have to fear in allowing the house to work its will ? \nWell , I do n't feel any differently about it today than I did then . \nSo my -- what I believe is necessary is we need to open up the House . \nWe need to let all members from both parties participate in the debate , offer their ideas , represent their constituents and let the House work its will . \nThe House should not be coerced to produce legislation that fits my needs . \nOr to fit anyone else 's needs . \nAnd I do believe that if we open up the House , it 'll drive more power back to the committees where members were going to have to begin to work together again . \nAnd I think the result of this is that we 'll have better legislation , we 'll have more bipartisan legislation and we will begin to melt the scar tissue that is built up between the two political parties . \nPARKER : Do you feel like last night 's date night helped toward that end ? \nBOEHNER : Well , I do n't know whether date night helped , but it was nice to see members spread out . \nThe vice president and I were not going to engage in the constantly jumping up and down and clapping . \nThis is the State of the Union . \nThe president comes here at the invitation of the Congress and the Congress in my view ought to respect the fact that a president has accepted the invitation and there ought to be more dignity at this event . \nLast night was better than what we 've seen in the past . \nNot as -- not as dignified as I 'd like to see it but we 're moving in the right direction . \nPARKER : I watched you and you have a poker face . \nIt 's very hard to read what 's going on . \nBOEHNER : Oh , I did n't last night . \nWell , you know , it 's difficult . \nYou 're sitting behind the president . \nYou got these cameras on you , you know , and my -- one of my girls sent me a text and said now just remember this camera is going to be on you looking for any bit of a reaction . \nSo I tried to do as good a job as I could . \nI did not want to be the issue . \nI never wanted to be the issue because this is not about me . \nPARKER : I 've heard that about you . \nI 've heard that you have kind of a coach 's approach to running the House . \nPARKER : You 're very happy to delegate and let other people have the limelight ? \nBOEHNER : I 've run my business , run my office and now hopefully run the House in a way where I try to build consensus . \nBuild consensus , move ahead . \nBuild consensus , move ahead . \nI do n't have to be in charge . \nBut my job is to bring people together , get people to work together to achieve a common good and the common good here is following the will of the American people . \nAnd I think there are a lot of Democrats and Republicans who do want to come together to fulfill the common good . \nPARKER : Do you feel like you have a good relationship with the president ? \nBOEHNER : I do . \nYou know , as I 've said it 's not particularly close , but we get along fine but I suspect over the coming months it 'll get a little closer . \nPARKER : You know one of the words that I listened out for in his speech last night was the word exceptional . \nI heard him use it when -- in Tucson . \nIn Tucson , of course , it 's been this horrific event for the whole country . \nBut I did n't hear him say it and I thought at a time when you 're building a speech around sort of defining the common purpose of America , that seemed to me a rather -- you know , a simple direct line , fairly -- pretty much a no-brainer , but he did n't say it . \nBOEHNER : Well , they -- they 've refused to talk about America exceptionalism . \nWe are different than the rest of the world . \nBecause Americans have -- the country was built on an idea that ordinary people could decide what their government looked like and ordinary people could elect their own leaders . \nAnd 235 years ago that was a pretty novel idea . \nAnd so we are different . \nWhy is our economy still 20 times the size of China 's ? \nBecause Americans have had their freedom to succeed , the freedom to fail . \nWe 've got more innovators , more entrepreneurs , and that is exceptional but you ca n't get the left to talk about it . \nThey do n't -- they reject that notion . \nPARKER : Why do you think that is ? \nBOEHNER : I do n't know . \nI do n't know . \nI do n't know if they 're afraid of it , whether they do n't believe it . \nI do n't know . \nPARKER : Going back one more time to the moment when Nancy Pelosi handed you that gavel , can you describe to me what that moment was like ? \nBOEHNER : It was nice . \nIt was n't -- I was proud to be there . \nBOEHNER : I was proud to be there . \nI was honored to be there . \nYou know , it 's an honor to be chosen by your colleagues to be their leader . \nBut I 've been as steady and calm over the last four or five months than I 've been in years and you ca n't get too excited because you know that while there may be a moment of excitement , there is a mountain of work looking at you the next day , and so it was nice , but it was a long day . \nPARKER : Sad , sad moment when we all got the news of what had happened in Tucson . \nAnd you are the speaker of the House . \nThis is your -- you know , your crowd and I know a lot of people -- everyone was very upset when you heard that Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords had been shot . \nHow did you feel ? \nBOEHNER : Well , I felt awful . \nBOEHNER : It was -- it was one of our own , and in addition to that , just was n't her , it was one of her staffers was killed and , you know , while most people do n't think much about our staff or just does n't come to mind , you know , there are about 10,000 staffers who work here on Capitol Hill . \nAnd it might have been the moment -- I had only been speaker for about three days and I really began -- I realized at that moment that I am the speaker and I 've got a big job to do . \nThere are a lot of pieces to what happens up here on Capitol Hill and who 's responsible , and on that Saturday I was responsible for a lot of it . \nBut I talked to the president . \nWorked with our security people and our logistics people and there were a lot to do . \nPARKER : Have you been in touch ? \nHave you been in touch ? \nBOEHNER : I sent her a card yesterday . \nI -- SPITZER : We 'll have a final thought from Kathleen 's exclusive conversation with Speaker Boehner later in the show . \nBut first coming up next , in Egypt , an explosion of violence in the streets and a government in crisis . \nThanks in part to twitter and Facebook , the young people of that nation rise up threatening the stability of what had been that region 's only stable country . \nHarrowing details when we come back . \nSPITZER : Violence and revolt in Egypt tonight , a country that was until now America 's most stable ally in the Middle East . \nThousands of protesters took to the streets for a second day calling for the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak . \nThe protesters were met with police using teargas , batons and water canons . \nFour people have died . \nMore than 100 are injured and things appear to be getting worse . \nHow did this happen ? \nWhat will it mean for America and the Middle East ? \nJoining me now from Cairo is CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman . \nBen , thanks for joining us . \nBEN WEDEMAN , CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : My pleasure , Eliot . \nSPITZER : So , Ben , fill us in . \nWhat is the latest ? \nWhat is happening in the streets and what happened there today ? \nWEDEMAN : Well , today started off fairly quiet with just a few scattered demonstrations , but the Interior Ministry made it clear early in the day that no protests would be tolerated . \nSo we saw around town small groups forming , trying to reproduce the massive demonstrations Cairo saw yesterday , but the crackdown was severe . \nThe police , no restraint today as we saw yesterday in relative terms , using their clubs , using their water cannon , using rubber bullets and teargas to try to disperse the demonstrators . \nBut every group they dispersed , another group formed somewhere else . \nWe 're hearing that the city of Suez on the Suez Canal is in a state of open or insurrection against the government that the police have pulled out of the city and that they are now burning down things like police stations and ruling party headquarters . \nSo even though the numbers of demonstrators in the streets of Cairo were smaller , it seems that this movement that really began sparked yesterday is not losing any momentum . \nSPITZER : What are the demands of the protesters if they can be discerned or known at this time ? \nAnd is there even an organization there to make demands ? \nWEDEMAN : Well , there 's not really an organization . \nWhat we have is something probably unique in history . \nWe have Facebook groups that have formed . \nAnd they had some basic demands . \nThey want a minimum wage . \nThey want an end to police brutality , an end to corruption , and more than anything what you hear from people in the street is one single very profound demand . \nThey want the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak who has been ruling this country longer than most Egyptians have been alive -- Eliot ? \nSPITZER : And is there any possibility that Mubarak would either resign and who is there to take over ? \nWhat would happen if he were to step down ? \nIs there an alternate government ? \nHis son has been apparently slated to take over . \nWhat could possibly happen ? \nWEDEMAN : Well , there 's a whole variety of scenarios , all of which have a lot of question marks around them . \nFirst of all , President Mubarak has not uttered a word in public since these demonstrations happened which is causing a good deal of concern , causing some people to think that the government is simply losing its grip at the moment . \nHe has no vice president . \nHe 's been president since 1981 and has always refused to appoint one saying that the people will decide . \nWell , the people have n't had a chance to decide this matter . \nThere 's a lot of talk about his so son , Gamal Mubarak , businessman , a banker in his mid-40s , taking over . \nBut Egyptians across the board have rejected that option . \nThey say we are after all a republic , not a monarchy , they do n't want that sort of system . \nThere 's always the option that the army can take over but that is something most people do n't really think is possible unless the situation goes out of control . \nSPITZER : Was there any intimation ? \nWas there any evidence that this could erupt in a place like Egypt ? \nWEDEMAN : I have to confess that I and all of my colleagues in the press corps here and all the protesters I spoke with , nobody predicted that it would get so big so fast and throughout the country . \nIt 's taken everybody by shock . \nThe police , as well . \nThey did n't expect this . \nAnd there were reasons for popular discontent . \nPolice brutality , corruption , under a president that 's been in power since 1981 , and -- but nobody thought that this would happen so dramatically so quickly . \nSPITZER : What has the press coverage of these revolts been and these protests ? \nHas it been supportive ? \nHas it led to larger and larger protests building up in different neighborhoods ? \nWEDEMAN : All right . \nThis is the state paper , sort of the gray lady of Egypt . \nTop story , `` Riots and Unrest , '' but it 's not in Egypt . \nIt 's in Lebanon . \nThe Egypt protest is below the fold . \nThis is referring to yesterday . \nHere is another newspaper . \nAl Masry Al Youm . \nHere you have top story , great big red headline says , `` Warning . '' \nComplete comprehensive coverage , very positive about the protest , so two completely different ways of looking at the demonstrations , and this really gives you an idea of the chasm between the official stance on these demonstrations and a more sort of independent popular view of what they mean and where they 're going . \nELIOT SPITZER , HOST : It seems that the communication between or among the protesters is on twitter , is on Facebook , is on social media . \nIs there any way for the government to shut that down ? \nWEDEMAN : Well , one important thing to point out is that Egypt has never put any blocks on the Internet . \nEgyptians can go to any site they want . \nHowever , yesterday during the protests , Twitter suddenly was blocked and that was one of the main forms of spreading information and spreading news about Egypt . \nEgyptian officials insist they did nothing . \nThey say that the system was overwhelmed and it simply did n't function in Egypt . \nAnd what 's interesting is that it took about an hour and a half ago , mid-evening in Cairo , the Twitter page was working again , but Twitter and Facebook , things like text messages have been key to spread the word to organize these demonstrations and to keep them going and to spread information so Egyptians even at these demonstrations , they 're half the time chanting , the other time they 're looking down at their mobile phones to read text messages to check Facebook , to check Twitter . \nSo it 's a very techie revolution if we can call it that . \nSPITZER : Who are the protesters ? \nWEDEMAN : There are students , workers , housewives . \nYou see middle - aged couples coming out to chant `` down with Mubarak . '' \nThere are sort of every sector of Egyptians deciding . \nWhat 's interesting is that the Muslim brotherhood , the largest political opposition bloc in Egypt is not taking part in these demonstrations . \nThey 're taking part as members , but as a group , it declined to participate . \nAnd what this really is , is at least , until now , is a secular movement . \nIt has no religious undertones . \nSPITZER : Ben Wedeman in Cairo , thank you so much for joining us . \nObviously this story will be continuing as this arc of revolution seems to be sweeping from Tunisia to Egypt , on to Lebanon . \nNo doubt we will be talking in the next couple of days . \nWe 'll be right back . \nSPITZER : Last night , President Obama laid out his agenda and he challenged us to be better -- a better country with a bigger future . \nBut again , I ask the same question I asked at the top of the show , how do we do it ? \nWith me tonight , two friends of the show were always grounded in reality , our conservative tag team , Will Cain from `` The National Review '' and conservative analyst E.D. Hill . \nWelcome to both of you as always . \nE.D. HILL , CONSERVATIVE ANALYST : Thank you . \nSPITZER : So , E.D. , let me start with you . \nWe heard the two rebuttals , responses from the Republican side . \nWe heard Paul Ryan , Michele Bachmann . \nDid either one of them give you a sense that they really knew how they were going to close this huge deficit that was what the Republican Party ran on last November ? \nHILL : They may have an idea but they certainly did n't share it , neither did President Obama . \nThat 's the problem that we face with Washington as a whole . \nWe just listened to John Boehner , as well . \nHe had the chance to say , yes , I would suggest we cut social security or we do this . \nHe did n't do it . \nHe said , well , everything is on the table . \nEverything is always on the table unless you 're not talking at all . \nYet no one is willing to take that step and say , let 's talk about this specifically . \nAnd that was my problem with all of them . \nSPITZER : And , look , I completely agree . \nI listened to them and then I read the transcripts looking for something concrete . \nBut , you know , well it seems your point about President Obama say not so much for him either , but this was the mantra of the Tea Party and the Republican Party and there 's Paul Ryan , the whiz kid budget guy , everybody has pointed to all season . \nAm I missing something ? \nWILL CAIN , `` NATIONAL REVIEW '' : Yes , I think you did on Ryan . \nFirst , Bachmann , no it was n't there . \nIf I told you last night we were getting a speech , a late night speech , from somebody whose eyeliner had gotten a little out of control and they started at your left ear as they spoke to you the entire time -- HILL : Do n't get on her makeup and the way she looked . \nCAIN : Do you think I was talking about the rebuttal of the State of the Union , or the late night closing time of Dorothy 's bumper club ? \nI mean -- SPITZER : No , no , I 'm watching you . \nHILL : You guys go after the women . \nIf the guy looks -- if the guy -- my eyeliner is fine . \nIf the guys look bad , you would n't be saying that . \nCAIN : No , let me tell you why I 'm hard -- SPITZER : I 'm with E.D. on this one . \nCAIN : Let me tell you why I 'm hard on Michele Bachmann . \nLet me tell you why I 'm hard on her . \nBecause I align myself very closely to Tea Party values and principles . \nAnd I think the Tea Party is an introspective movement that forces conservatives to look at the way we 've taken opportunities to govern , to really realign our priorities . \nAnd what I heard from Michele Bachmann last night was blame -- blame , not unfairly appointed to Obama but way too external . \nWe need to look at ourselves and that 's what I did n't hear from Michele Bachmann . \nI think Paul Ryan did begin to give us the message . \nI do think we heard something . \nActually I think it was subtle . \nI think it was when we talked -- SPITZER : That could be why I missed it . \nWhen he talked about social security , he said when we look at reforming entitlements , we will not touch the entitlements of people who are in or near retirement . \nI think that was a nod to the road back for America . \nI think he was saying there we do have a solution for your entitlement problem , and I 've already put it together and it does n't touch the entitlements of old people . \nHILL : More people just hitting you upside the head with a two by four and telling you what they 're going to do . \nSPITZER : I 'm with E.D. on this one . \nI mean , if that was , in fact , the subtle message , and I heard that . \nAnd I thought maybe this was a nod towards raising the retirement age or somehow changing the contribution structure . \nSPITZER : But this was his moment to speak to the nation and just as with John Boehner 's interview a few moments ago on the show , we said we have to have the conversation . \nFellows , this is the conversation . \nYou seize the moment to lead . \nI mean , that 's what disappointed me . \nCAIN : He 's got 10 minutes . \nIs that 10 minutes ? \nYou 're not going to lay out your budget proposals in 10 minutes . \nI expect to hear them in the coming days and weeks . \nHILL : I expected to hear him last night . \nI 'm not giving him a pass because they 're the professionals . \nThey 're the ones who have compose chosen to do this for their life . \nThey 're the ones who have told us that they can lead us , that they can figure out the way to make our country better and they do n't . \nSPITZER : What do you think of Michele Bachmann or Paul Ryan should have said ? \nHILL : I think they should have given specifics . \nLet 's go with Bachmann . \nShe was really railing on everybody else and what 's , you know , hurting us . \nThen you know what , then take that step and call them out . \nCall out India and say you 're not opening up your domestic markets to our companies . \nSo you know what , we can do it . \nAmerica can do it . \nOur companies can do it , but give us a fair playing field . \nAnd neither of them did that . \nNeither did President Obama . \nSPITZER : Social security . \nLet 's just stick to that for one more second . \nSPITZER : Because it is the touchtone , or Medicare or Medicaid . \nShould they have said directly we will raise the retirement age and here 's when and how we 'll do it ? \nSuch as the bipartisan commission did -- CAIN : Principally , principally yes . \nIt would be an entire political mistake to suggest that the House of Representatives now controlled by the Republicans will put out entitlement reform only to be vetoed and lambasted in the Senate and at the presidency . \nPrincipally , I would love to hear it . \nHILL : This should have come from Obama . \nIt was his bipartisan commission that came up with it . \nSPITZER : We 'll get to that in a minute . \nI agree , and I 've written the same thing . \nI wish he had done that . \nI would have said it because I think it is incumbent now given the crisis that we are facing for them to get to that point and say it . \nLet 's move on to the president 's speech for a minute . \nCAIN : Yes , that was an hour long speech compared to these two -- SPITZER : All right . \nBut look , they all had their moments to pick and choose what to say . \nThe president 's speech struck me as in a way schizophrenic . \nOn the one hand talking about a lot of investment , on the other hand talking about the fact that we have a deficit and therefore he was going to freeze domestic spending . \nI want to focus for a moment on the investments he talked about and conceptually you , as conservatives , do agree with him increasing investment in education to upgrade the quality of our human capital as they call it . \nHILL : I agree with increasing investments in a certain way . \nI guess getting money back to people and to companies . \nI do n't agree with more government spending . \nI agree with giving people more money for them to spend . \nSPITZER : Let me refine that . \nHILL : Education -- you can put more people through college but if they do n't have jobs when they come out of it , it does n't really matter . \nSPITZER : That 's certainly right . \nBut do you agree with expanding Pell Grants , for instance , expanding the G.I. bill concept of giving people access to loans , to pay college tuitions that are right now beyond the reach of many ? \nHILL : Specifically what he said was , you know , you should get a tax break for college tuition . \nI 'm totally on board . \nCAIN : You and I talked about it . \nI think you 're touching on the edges of education reform almost worthlessly . \nUntil we start talking about the way to improve our students ' test scores , I do n't care how many you send to college . \nSPITZER : Well , you care about -- I do n't want it . \nCAIN : You get my point . \nSPITZER : I get your point . \nI 'm trying to save you -- HILL : I 'm trying to send one in college . \nSPITZER : But in that case what would you do ? \nWhat would your education reform agenda be ? \nAnd , look , the president has raced to the top which many people give a lot of credit to . \nWould you expand on that ? \nCAIN : I do n't think education reform has to be centered in Washington , D.C. I think education reform can be done at the state and even at a local level where you actually know who your bureaucrats are and know who your teachers are . \nHILL : I agree with that . \nCAIN : I think that 's the way to go about education reform . \nSPITZER : But do you think that the president and Arne Duncan , the secretary of education , who is viewed by many as almost a visionary has done a good job using the federal money as a way , basically as candy saying to the states , embrace reform and we will compensate you for it . \nHILL : I 'm with Will on this . \nI do n't think that this is one of many jobs that federal government ca n't do as well as state and local governments . \nI think states understand what the unique problems are to their localities . \nThey need to be handling this . \nSPITZER : All right . \nWe 'll put education aside but let 's go to another type of investment , the infrastructure investments he keeps talking about . \nRoad , highways , the Internet . \nHILL : We both sat back . \nCAIN : I know you want to go through every single investment , but let me just say -- SPITZER : I 'm trying to understand your sense here . \nCAIN : I want to give you my sense . \nAnd here it is . \nWhen the president -- the president and I have very different visions of America . \nWhen the president uses words like innovate and compete and work hard and do more , '' he 's talking about the collective we . \nHe 's talking about government . \nThese are words that I have traditionally assigned , and I think America has assigned to individuals and entrepreneurs . \nThey are who innovate . \nThey are who make us competitive . \nIf the government can do things to get out of their way , that is a beneficial step . \nSPITZER : But do you agree , E.D. , that the notion of basic research being funded by the Defense Department , by NASA , by government , which has led to so many of these critical investments , let 's face it the Internet really did come out of government labs . \nDo you buy that notion , therefore , health research , good idea , bad idea ? \nHILL : I think that research is a good idea . \nHowever , I want to go back to your idea about this whole transportation and the infrastructure because I spent last summer driving across America with a bunch of my kids and I kept on seeing this `` your federal stimulus dollars at work . '' \nThey were out there ripping up highways and literally in the middle of cornfields that were perfectly fine and repaving them . \nAnd to me that 's not accomplishing anything . \nUse that money wisely . \nThat 's what they do n't do . \nCAIN : You used the word I think was completely appropriate earlier . \nAt one point in the president 's speech last night , he said nobody could have seen the Internet coming . \nAnd then in other parts , he suggests that he can peer into the future and see what the future energy sources for America are and we 'll subsidize those . \nThere 's a huge amount of hubris and arrogance in that assumption that you actually know . \nWhy is there not some kid working on cold fusion or turning ocean water into oil ? \nWhy do you know it 's wind ? \nWhy are you going to allocate so much of our money to that ? \nSPITZER : Will , I think he 's saying something different . \nI think what he is saying is that the Department of Energy which has funded so much of the critical breakthrough technologies when it comes to energy wo n't play venture capital firm trying to pick companies and invest in them . \nIt will give grants to universities , University of Chicago . \nYou know , pick your favorite state university and say , you do the research on fusion , on fission . \nHILL : But we 've been researching . \nWe know what works . \nYou just ca n't -- SPITZER : No , we do n't yet know . \nHILL : You know that wind works , you know solar works , you know nuclear works and yet you do n't -- you 've got . \nSPITZER : But clean coal , for instance -- clean coal , which I think we all aspire to have as part of our complex of energy sources , you know , using traditional dirty coal but somehow taking the carbon dioxide and submerging it below ground so we do n't have the green gas issues , that is only going to happen if the federal government subsidizes it . \nCAIN : Eliot , if these are real , viable businesses that have a place in the market , they will figure out a way to make it on their own . \nI 'm afraid you 'll spend 50 years funding projects that have no future and in 50 years we 'll look back and it will be the equivalent of you trying to fund jet packs . \nSPITZER : Let me ask you a question . \nHILL : -- say the same thing . \nWe need to be researching . \nI think fish or cut bait . \nLet 's go out there and start making some changes . \nSPITZER : Have you spoken to any executive in the nuclear sector recently ? \nThey will tell you they want to build plants but what do they need ? \nThey need federal guarantees on the loan . \nThey need limitations and liability . \nThese are the sorts of government assistance projects that are in my view neither conservative nor liberal . \nThey are market intervention but the nuclear sector wo n't be part of our energy structure if we do n't do it . \nAre you against that ? \nCAIN : No , I 'm not against that . \nI think there is some place for some role in the government aiding some businesses along at a very , very small level . \nNot for a new investment as it was put out last night . \nCAIN : Not for the increasing our spending to the degrees that we 've been hearing . \nLook , this is going to be a continuing conversation with as we call you `` our tag team of conservatives . '' \nSee if we can put up on the screen here my favorite chart . \nHILL : Oh , good . \nSPITZER : Here we go . \nLook at this chart for a second . \nIt shows you -- HILL : Bachmann was using charts too . \nSPITZER : I like that . \nThat 's the part I liked about the speech . \nI got a copy here . \nYou ca n't see . \nSPITZER : Top one percent has had income go up 281 percent . \nMiddle class in the 25 percent , about 1980 . \nHILL : Is this your spreadsheet at home ? \nCAIN : No , I agree with E.D. HILL : Keeping people from making money , no , I do n't think they should do . \nI do n't think it 's the government 's job to redistribute that into some sense that you think is more fair . \nI want the rising tide to lift all those -- HILL : I like you speechless . \nCAIN : I want them -- HILL : He 's looking and saying , are you crazy ? \nSPITZER : No , I 'm just trying to watch you dig a little deeper . \nCAIN : I want the rising tide to lift all those . \nI want the middle class incomes to have greater purchasing power . \nI do n't think it has to be in direct proportion to the wealthiest in society . \nSPITZER : What if the rising tide is lifting only the yachts , but not the rowboats ? \nDoes that bother you ? \nHILL : I do n't think in our economy that is what will happen . \nCertainly you can -- I know . \nCertainly you can pull out your chart and you can show that . \nAnd recently that is the case . \nBut I think that if the federal government backs off and lets people take more control of their own lives , of their companies , helps small , medium size companies do better , gives them the tax breaks , I think you do bring all those boats up . \nSPITZER : Will , Will wants to raise the yachts . \nCAIN : No , I think the issue is a tad bit more complicated than your chart . \nAnd I think there are income and wealth opportunities included in that middle class line that do n't show up . \nI think there are health care benefits . \nThey 're provided through the employer that do n't show up on that line . \nHILL : Will , you 're challenging him to come up with another chart . \nSPITZER : Next time , more charts . \nThat 's what you want . \nE.D. and Will , as always thanks for being with us . \nComing up , Kathleen asked Speaker of the House John Boehner , any politician 's favorite question . \nSPITZER : There 's one question no prominent politician can avoid , but that does n't mean they do n't love to be asked . \nKathleen sprints it on Speaker Boehner . \nKATHLEEN PARKER , HOST : I was thinking about 2012 , at last count about 413 people running for the Republican nomination for president . \nREP. JOHN BOEHNER -LRB- R -RRB- , HOUSE SPEAKER : And one of them will win . \nPARKER : Is that ever on your agenda ? \nBOEHNER : Oh , no , no. . \nNo , no , no , no , no. . \nI decided a long time ago I never really wanted to be governor . \nAnd I really did n't want to be senator . \nSo I decided all right the rest of my political career is going to be in the U.S. House . \nI thought I 'd be here about 10 years and go back and run my business or go do something else . \nBut here it is , I 've been here 20 . \nBut I decided a long time ago that the rest of my career was going to be in the House . \nMy goal ought to be to be the speaker . \nShoot for the top you 'll never get there . \nPARKER : What do you want your stamp to be when you leave as speaker ? \nBOEHNER : I want to have an institution that truly represents the will of the American people . \nAnd I want to have a process in place where no leader in the future can turn the clock back and take control away from the members . \nPARKER : All right . \nWell , thank you so much , Speaker Boehner . \nSPITZER : When we come back , from Maine to Mississippi , another winter storm blasts the East Coast . \nBundle up and stay tuned . \nSPITZER : The northeast is slammed with another winter storm . \nWarnings have now been issued from Maine to Mississippi . \nParts of the northeast could see more than 10 inches of snow tonight and this is just after digging out from a blizzard earlier this month . \nTake a look at the picture outside the building here . \nYou can see , well , maybe if you look carefully , wind and snow blowing through Central Park . \nGorgeous view unless you 're stuck outside . \nAnd then take another picture . \nThis is the White House . \nSnow continues to fall there . \nMore than 40,000 people , unfortunately , without power in Philadelphia . \nIf you 're trying to fly out of Philadelphia right now , this is what it looks like , does n't look like too many planes are taking off . \nAnd here 's the view from Boston where they could get close to a foot of snow . \nOh , my goodness , just what the kids want . \nParents not too happy about it . \nMeteorologist Bonnie Schneider joins us with the latest . \nBonnie , what 's going on right now ? \nBONNIE SCHNEIDER , AMS METEOROLOGIST : Well , Eliot , the storm is certainly not over yet . \nWe 're watching our radar picture that shows a lot of snow sweeping through the mid-Atlantic and then on up into New England . \nAt times it 's been mixing with sleet and turning slushy making for a real mess out there . \nNotice the change over here on Long Island , for example , where the warmer air is coming in . \nAnd then back to the south and to the east , we 're seeing some more snow build in . \nSo it 's going to be cold enough to see that changeover overnight . \nThe temperatures right over parts of Pennsylvania into the low 30s and then in the 40s along the Jersey Shore . \nThat 's where you 're seeing some really heavy thunderstorms mixing in with sleet at times . \nJust really a treacherous situation out there . \nThe question is what happens now as we go forward ? \nLet 's take a look at the storm track and we 'll advance it on end . \nAnd what you 'll find is that the storm is working its way to the north and east in a classic nor'easter sense . \nIt 's kind of sliding up the coastline . \nIt will be off the coast of New York by early tomorrow morning . \nKind of in the overnight hours when we expect some really heavy snow to pile up and then it advances further to the east . \nIt 's a fast-moving storm . \nSo we actually could have seen even more snow with this system but it 's going to dump some heavy amounts . \nFour to six inches for Washington . \nEight inches to a foot in New York . \nEight inches to a foot in Boston . \nAnd , of course , there 's always the risk for isolated higher amounts . \nOther thing to note that 's really important is the temperatures . \nAnd right around the 30s . \nSo it 's not that cold where we 're seeing light fluffy snow . \nWe 're seeing big flakes , wet heavy snow . \nThis is going to be dangerous tomorrow , Eliot , for people that are trying to shovel out because the snow will be heavy and tough to maneuver . \nSPITZER : You know , Bonnie , real quick , before time runs out . \nAre there more storms like this coming ? \nIt seems like every week we 're getting another one . \nMy kids are never going to school . \nSnow holidays every day . \nIs this just me imagining this , or is this for real ? \nSCHNEIDER : No , you are not imagining it at all . \nBecause when you look at cities like Philadelphia and New York and even in Boston and Syracuse , we are way above normal for this time of year . \nAlready in New York , over 27 inches of snow . \nFor this date for the winter , the normal by this time would be 9.3 inches . \nAnd remember coming up , February is the snowiest month of the year . \nSo we have a lot more ahead . \nSPITZER : All right , something to look forward to . \nBonnie Schneider , thank you . \nAnd thank you all so much for being with us tonight . \nGood night from New York . \nI 'm Eliot Spitzer . \n`` PIERS MORGAN TONIGHT '' starts right now .

{"txt": "LONDON | Thu Aug 18 , 2011 10:40 pm BST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Oil markets will quietly swallow the loss of modest Syrian supplies if Europe joins Washington in slapping new sanctions on the country , but prices would spike if Syria 's ally and major oil producer Iran becomes directly involved in a confrontation with the West . \nAnalysts and traders said it would take several weeks before Syrian oil trade could grind to a halt , even if traders such as Vitol or Trafigura are forced to stop sending refined products for President Bashar Assad 's government and companies such as Shell are forced to stop producing and exporting oil from Syria . \n''It would take several weeks before there is a real impact on globalized oil markets . \nI would never discount Iran at some point taking some kind of retaliatory action , '' said Paul Harris from Bank of Ireland . \nThe United States on Thursday imposed fresh sanctions on Syria , freezing assets in the United States as well as banning Syrian-origin petroleum and petroleum products in response to weeks of Assad 's lethal crackdown on anti-government protesters . \nSyria 's oil production declined to 385,000 barrels per day in 2010 from 581,000 bpd in 2001 , or just a fraction of the 1.6 million bpd that OPEC-member Libya was producing earlier this year before its civil war shut down output . \nSyria exports over one third of its output to Europe , and companies such as Shell , Total , China 's CNPC and India 's ONGC are responsible for a large chunk of its production together with the state 's Syrian Petroleum Company . \nShell and Total told Reuters on Thursday they always comply with relevant sanctions , legislation and laws but declined to comment on whether they are ready to stop producing oil in Syria or buying its oil . \nShell produces around 55,000 bpd in Syria . \nA Vitol spokesman said the company was not commenting on individual transactions but added that if a contract has commenced and payment has been received , the delivery would go ahead . \n`` Trafigura is awaiting clarification of the situation following today 's announcements with respect to sanctions related to Syria . \nThe company always operates in accordance with relevant national and international regulations , '' the trading house said in a statement . \nAnalysts and traders said they would not lose sleep even if all Syrian supplies were lost . \n`` How big an issue is it with Syria when you have got Saudi Arabia acting as a potential backstop to any shortfalls ?

{"txt": "DUBAI | Fri Oct 21 , 2011 7:47 am EDT DUBAI -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - For many Arabs , the humiliating capture and killing of Muammar Gaddafi , the longest-serving Arab leader , is a lesson to other tyrants in a region that has overthrown three long-serving rulers this year . \nBut some said on Friday that Libya would have been better off if its former leader had been given a fair trial for abuses committed during his 42-year rule , which ended when rebels captured the capital Tripoli in August . \n`` * Libya should have had a fair trial -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- , said Haji Ismail , a banker in the Omani capital Muscat . \n`` This is the end he deserves . '' \nIn Cairo , Youssef Hammad , a 43-year-old business executive , said he was not surprised by Gaddafi 's gruesome demise . \n`` The way he was going to die , if caught , was sealed when he ignored his people 's calls for a more open and free society , '' Hammad said . \n`` Instead he vowed to hunt them down one by one , alleyway by alleyway , like rats . \nIronically that 's how he met his maker . '' \nGaddafi , a fugitive since August , was killed on Thursday after fighters for the National Transitional Council captured his last stronghold and hometown of Sirte . \nHe tried to flee the city in a convoy , braving NATO airstrikes . \nHis captors found him hiding in a drainage culvert , and cellphone video showed a bloodied Gaddafi being beaten . \nLibya 's Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril said that Gaddafi was hit during `` crossfire '' while being taken to hospital , but most Libyans , including officials , seemed to have little doubt that he was probably killed by his captors . \nThe Egyptian cabinet said after a meeting on Thursday it was looking forward to helping the Libyan people rebuild their country . \nBut most Arab governments have yet to comment on Gaddafi 's death . \nGaddafi was the third Arab head of state to be ousted this year , after Tunisia 's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali and Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak . \nBut unlike Ben Ali and Mubarak , who were ousted by popular uprisings in January and February , Gaddafi was overthrown in a civil war that the new interim government says cost some 30,000 lives . \nMany Arabs said Gaddafi 's death was likely to scare Arab leaders still clinging to power in Syria and Yemen in the face of months of pro-democracy protests and crackdowns by security forces that have left thousands of people dead . \nIn the Omani capital Muscat , banker Haji Ismail said Gaddafi 's death was a lesson to other Arab rulers . \n`` They will face such a fate if they keep oppressing their people . '' \nCairo engineer Ibrahim Sabri said Arab leaders were afraid of meeting a similar fate . \n`` This was evident in the Syrian TV denial of Gaddafi 's news , they are afraid that they will share the same fate , '' he said . \nIn Syria , where President Bashar al-Assad has faced seven months of popular protests opposing his rule , video footage of a demonstration on Thursday night in Homs province showed people chanting : `` Bashar , it is your turn next ! '' \nIn the Syrian town of Houla , people carried placards saying : `` Syrian rebels congratulate the Libyan people for killing the rat Muammar Gaddafi , '' and `` Death is the fate of all oppressive rulers - first the rat Muammar Gaddafi , then the thug Bashar al-Assad .

'' \nThe officer started out prickly one of his opening gambits was , `` You could be spending the night in jail , wiseguy '' , which simultaneously impressed and scared me but several minutes of profuse apologies and crikey-I 'm - sorry delivered in an embellished British accent appeared to disarm him , and I was released without being subjected to gunfire . \nThat 's my recollection , anyway . \nPerhaps he just got bored with watching me grovel . \nI said a lot of things . \n`` The US is a wonderful country , '' Representatives from United Nations and the British embassy told me . \nI said `` Good day '' to receptionists and `` I beg your pardon '' to waiters . \nAt one point I think I even said `` Toodle pip '' to a cabbie . \nIncredibly , rather than calling me a dick , they said they loved my accent . \nThe US was a magic country where strangers liked me on the strength of my voice alone , unlike cold anonymous London where , rather than break their stride , pedestrians would blankly step on your face if you were dying on the pavement , quietly tutting at the blood on their shoes . \nOn a subsequent trip I discovered mockney was just as useful , and deliberately roughed my accent down in gas stations or bars , saying `` blimey '' and `` bloke '' and `` bleedin ' ` ell '' , even if I was only asking the way to the toilet -LRB- sorry , `` bog '' -RRB- . \nThis was even more popular than my Little Lord Fauntleroy act . \nThank God I ca n't do a Liverpudlian accent . \nI 'd probably have adopted a Beatles persona in record shops . \nBut now , as a company with the word `` British '' in its name pisses apocalyptic quantities of oil into the ocean , and CEO Tony Hayward pops up on the news to make tactless statements in a British accent , anglophilia is shrivelling . \nThings must be bad when gimpy Cameron has to reassure us that BP wiping its arse on the Gulf of Mexico wo n't disturb the `` special relationship '' between the US and the UK . \nOf course it will . \nNever mind that BP is an international company . \nNever mind that 39 % of its shares are held in the US , that half its directors are American . \nIt 's got the word British in the title , and that 'll do . \nIt genuinely feels like our fault . \nLike you , I 've never supervised the offshore drilling policy of a major oil company , but I ca n't help feeling responsible . \nIt 's like watching a news report in which someone with your surname has been caught having sex with a hollowed-out yam . \nThe disgrace is shared , however irrationally . \nAnd to be honest , the Americans are thus far admirably restrained about the whole thing . \nIf a company called Texan Gloop belched a carpet of black gunk over Norfolk , we 'd be surrounding the US embassy and burning sarcastic effigies of Boss Hogg within minutes . \nAnd that 's just Norfolk : flat earth and windmills . \nHaving vandalised Louisiana and laminated thousands of pelicans , the BP spill now threatens to disfigure the Miami coastline , corrupting its relentlessly cheery blue-and-yellow color scheme with a sea of rainbow black . \nCongratulations , people of Britain . \nEven though , strictly speaking , it is n't your fault . \nClearly a rebrand is in order if we 're to maintain any national pride whatsoever . \nTrouble is , BP 's already had one : 10 years ago it changed its name from British Petroleum to BP following a merger with a US oil company . \nSince that 's not enough to dissociate it from Britain , Britain itself will have to change its name . \nIt 'll still need to feel quintessentially British , mind . \nFor the tourists , like . \nHow about London Kingdom ? \nLet 's face it : to recoup our cultural value , it 's either that or we all head over there and start cleaning the mess up ourselves , while muttering `` blimey '' and `` gosh '' and doing our best to be charming . \nIf you 've got a fly-drive holiday booked , start practising that Hugh Grant act now . \nChances are you 'll need it .

{"txt": "CAIRO | Mon Mar 7 , 2011 6:56 pm EST CAIRO -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - One of Muammar Gaddafi 's sons , Saadi , said on Monday his father had not yet thrown his army into full battle against rebels , saving it to shield Libya against foreign attack , and civil war could erupt if he did . \nIn an interview with Al Arabiya television , Saadi Gaddafi also said the Libyan leader could not resign as demanded by the rebels because that could also lead to civil war . \nSaadi blamed some of the unrest on one of his brothers , Saif al-Islam , who he said had sought economic reforms but failed to address the problems of ordinary Libyans . \n`` The tribes are all armed , there are forces from the Libyan army and the eastern region is armed . \nThe situation is not like Tunisia or Egypt , '' said Saadi , who was briefly a professional footballer in Italy before turning to business . \nProtests in Tunisia and Egypt have toppled the presidents of both countries since the start of the year . \n`` The situation is very dangerous , '' he said . \nThe leader must play a very , very big role in calming Libya and convincing people to sit together . \n`` If something happened to the leader , who would be in control ? \nA civil war would start . '' \nHe said the Libyan army had so far only intervened to protect `` sensitive sites '' and a wider war would result if his father ordered them into an all-out fight . \n`` The leader has given special instructions to the army not to intervene , save for the protection of sensitive sites , and to be ready to repel foreign intervention . '' \nThe military was just waiting for Gaddafi 's orders , Saadi said . \n`` So far it has not moved . \nWhen it does , a civil war may erupt , '' he said in the full broadcast of the interview , which Al Arabiya had excerpted earlier in the day . \nThe news channel said that Saadi Gaddafi warned that Libya would turn into a new Somalia and that tribes would fight against each other . \nHe said Tripoli was holding a dialogue through the tribes to answer the demands of the people , without making clear which demands he was referring to . \n`` But there are armed groups that pursue the path of killing and violence , which I think leaves only the choice of confronting them , '' he added . \nSaadi 's criticism of his brother Saif al-Islam hinted at strains within the Gaddafi family as the unrest continued . \n`` The leader told them -LRB- Saif al-Islam and the ministers -RRB- on a daily basis that you are facilitating matters and the budget , but there are things they did not do . '' \nThose shortcomings included failing to address issues like prices of basic commodities that concerned Libyans , Saadi said . \nThe reforming efforts of Saif al-Islam were stymied by opposition from inside the ruling elite and , some analysts had said , family members . \nEducated at a British university , Saif al-Islam has acted a spokesman for his father during the unrest . \nSaadi had a brief career in Italy 's Serie A soccer league between 2003 and 2007 , though he had little time on the field . \nSaadi , who qualified as an engineer and also holds military rank , later turned to business . \nHe told Reuters in an interview last year he was behind a project to set up a free trade zone on the Mediterranean coast west of Tripoli . \nWhen violence engulfed Libya 's eastern city of Benghazi in mid-February , Saadi spoke on local radio to say he had been appointed commandant of the city . \nSoon after , residents took control of Benghazi and forced out Gaddafi 's forces . \n-LRB- Reporting by Ali Abdellati and Sohail Karam , writing by Edmund Blair and Tom Heneghan -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/libyawar_reuters/rsd/LibyaWar_reuters__2011-03-07__102.rsd.txt"}

{"txt": "Wednesday 14 December 2005 18.17 GMT The US president , George Bush , today admitted much of the intelligence used as the basis for invading Iraq had been `` wrong '' - but defended his decision to go to war because it removed Saddam Hussein . \nIn a speech at the Woodrow Wilson Centre , in Washington , Mr Bush also pledged that US troops would remain in Iraq until `` victory is achieved '' . \nThe speech was the fourth and last in a series aimed at bolstering flagging support for the Iraqi conflict . \nMr Bush said that much of the intelligence used as the basis for invading Iraq had been `` wrong `` - but defended his decision to go to war because it removed Saddam Hussein . \n`` Al-Qaida was linked to Iraq in a pre-war claim , which the US government later denied , '' said Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi . \n`` As president , I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq . '' \nHowever , he added : `` My decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision . \nSaddam was a threat , and the American people and the world is better off because he is no longer in power . '' \nThe intelligence Mr Bush could have been referring to may be the pre-war information gathered from Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi , a Libyan , who claimed al-Qaida was linked to Iraq . \nMr Libi later said he made his most specific claims whilst in Egyptian custody in a bid to avoid `` harsh treatment '' . \nIn a CIA report published in the New York Times last week , unnamed officials admitted that Mr Libi been subjected to rendition when he told his interrogators that Iraq had trained al-Qaida operatives . \nBefore the Iraq war , the Bush administration frequently cited Mr Libi 's information as `` credible evidence '' . \nOn the eve of Iraq 's first parliamentary elections , the US president pledged to solve the previous problems with his administration 's intelligence capabilities . \nHe was adamant that US troops would remain in Iraq until a `` free and democratic '' country was in place . \n`` We can not and will not leave Iraq until victory is achieved , '' he said . \nMr Bush reiterated his hopes that an Iraq with a functioning democracy and thriving economy would be a model for other nations in the Middle East . \nIn the Senate , 40 Democrats and one independent signed a letter to Mr Bush in which they urged him to be more open with the Iraqi and US public . \nThe letter urged the administration to `` tell the leaders of all groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and sustainable political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq within the schedule they set for themselves '' . \nIt adds that Mr Bush must also present `` a plan that identifies the remaining political , economic , and military benchmarks that must be met and a reasonable schedule to achieve them '' . \nThe president responded by outlining what constituted victory in Iraq and when US troops could begin returning home . \n`` Victory will be achieved by meeting certain objectives : when the terrorists and Saddamists can no longer threaten Iraq 's democracy , when the Iraqi security forces can protect their own people , and when Iraq is not a safe haven for terrorists to plot attacks against our country , '' he said . \n`` These objectives , not timetables set by politicians in Washington , will drive our force levels in Iraq .

{"txt": "Journalists believe recent deaths and injuries among their number based in Iraq show US troops are getting out of control It was a routine assignment that , like too many in Iraq , went wrong . \nTipped off that police had clashed with gunmen in western Baghdad , the Reuters news agency dispatched Haider Kadhem , a cameraman , and Waleed Khaled , a soundman , to the scene . \nAs their car headed down Ghaziliya bridge American troops opened fire , hitting Khaled in the face and the chest , killing him instantly and spattering blood over the US military and Reuters press cards clipped to his shirt . \nBy the time relatives and colleagues arrived American armored vehicles had sealed off the street and Kadhem , slightly wounded from fragments , was under arrest . \nHaving found nothing suspicious the troops allowed the car to be towed away and handed relatives a body bag . \nOne soldier told them not to look too closely at the corpse . \n`` Do n't bother . \nIt 's not worth it . '' \nOther soldiers standing a few feet away joked among themselves . \nJournalists believe recent deaths and injuries among their number show US troops are getting out of control . \nSince the 2003 invasion US forces have killed at least 18 media workers in incidents for which no one has been charged or punished . \nThere have been no satisfactory investigations that we know of , '' said Rodney Pinder , director of the International News Safety Institute -LRB- INSI -RRB- , a Brussels-based advocacy group . \nAngry and frustrated , several radio and television networks , agencies and newspapers , including the Guardian , met last week to chart a joint response to the crisis . \nThe gathering agreed to form a foreign correspondents ' association and to jointly lobby the US military and state department . \nMore journalists have been killed in Iraq in two years than during the 20 years of conflict in Vietnam , according to Reporters Without Borders . \nIt counted 66 dead in Iraq compared to 63 in Vietnam and 49 in the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1995 . \nINSI estimates the Iraq toll at 81 while the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists reckons 74 . \nInsurgents killed most and with few exceptions , such as the Italian Enzo Baldoni , the victims were Iraqis . \nForeign journalists , based in fortified hotels or compounds , can move discreetly around the capital and accompany coalition troops on missions but they routinely rely on Iraqi colleagues for on the ground reporting . \nIncreasingly US forces pose the graver threat . \n`` It is becoming impossible for us in good conscience to send out reporters to gather information because we do n't know what will happen to them , '' says Richard Engel , a correspondent for the US television network NBC . \nIf something goes wrong , he says , `` we do n't know what procedures if any exist to follow up . '' \nThe International Federation of Journalists accused the US military of `` incompetence , reckless soldiering , and cynical disregard '' for journalists ' lives . \nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said there appeared to be official `` indifference '' to reporters ' deaths . \nIn addition to shooting them , US forces have a habit of detaining journalists without charge . \nWeeks can pass before a bureau is able to confirm that an employee has been arrested , possibly injured , and held incommunicado in Abu Ghraib or another prison . \nA driver for the Guardian , accredited with the US authorities , was held without explanation for five days . \nAt stake is not only the existence of independent media , says Alastair Macdonald , Reuters ' Baghdad bureau chief , but the credibility of US claims to be fostering democracy . \n`` The American ambassador recently called us the fourth estate , a pillar of the democracy , but we 're not being allowed to do our job here . '' \nWhen the US military detains employees media organizations try to sort it out privately , going through regular channels , appealing to the relevant major or colonel , until it dawns that this does not work . \nAsked at a recent press conference if there was a special policy for journalists , a handful of the 10,000 US-held detainees , Major General Rick Lynch , a US military spokesman , was blunt : `` That 's a no. . \nWhat we 've got to do is look at the individual that was indeed detained and what was he doing , regardless of what his profession is . '' \nMany correspondents say the fundamental problem is that US forces do not recognize the media 's right to work in Iraq . \nAlmost every single Iraqi stringer in Mosul , a volatile northern city , has been arrested , including a freelance cameraman for CBS who was shot in April and has been detained since without charge . \nInvestigations into shootings are conducted by an officer from the unit which opened fire . \nInvariably shooters are exonerated and victims deemed at least partly culpable . \nWaleed Khaled 's case was typical . \nA three-day investigation concluded the 35-year-old Reuters soundman was driving fast , stopped , immediately reversed and that he or Haider Kadhem , the cameraman , leaned out with what appeared to be a weapon . \n`` Our soldiers on the scene , using established rules of engage-ment and all the training received , decided that it was appropriate to engage that particular car . '' \nIn other words the popular , jokey newsroom presence , the husband of a pregnant wife , the father of a four-year-old girl , brought it on himself . \nHis colleague Kadhem , 24 , was released without charge after three days of questioning about `` inconsistencies '' in his story . \nUS military spokesmen often cite `` strong evidence '' that an arrested Iraqi was an insurgent who used his work as cover . \nDespite astonishing allegations - including the shooting down of a helicopter by three journalists - no proof has emerged publicly . \nHardly a surprise given that the legal process is secret and reports are not published . \nA smear or not , hinting at evidence can intimidate an employer less than 100 % sure about a stringer 's background . \n`` They make you ask yourself if you really want to bat for this guy , '' says one bureau chief . \nSuch tactics contrast with the military 's warm embrace of those who `` embed '' , a well-oiled , largely transparent system which allows journalists to attach themselves limpet-like to troops . \nEverything is on the record and what you file , though monitored once published or broadcast , is uncensored . \nThe openness and access -LRB- not to mention the food -RRB- tends to be better than the more controlled British version . \nThere is no consensus on why there is such hostility to independent media . \nSome think it reflects the clumsiness of an army wrestling with a complicated guerrilla campaign . \nInsurgent cameramen do accompany gunmen and film attacks which end up on the internet . \nWhen a television crew arrives during or immediately after a fight troops often suspect the crew knew in advance . \nAn urban myth , say the networks , but a dangerous one when even an established name like CNN is branded the Communist News Network . \nThere is scant evidence that US troops deliberately target the press , unlike Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza . \nBut commanders who view Iraq as an information war have an interest in blocking images they deem damaging . \nIn a rare cracking of the opaque military Phillip Robertson , a reporter for the online magazine Salon.com , found the sniper who shot his friend Yasser Salihee , an Iraqi employee of the Knight-Ridder newspaper group . \nSalihee died instantly when a bullet entered his right eye as he drove towards a checkpoint in Baghdad in June . \nNamed only as Joe , the sniper said his unit was braced for a suicide bomber and that the car appeared suspicious . \nJoe was troubled by the feeling that his victim was not an insurgent . \n`` I really hope he was a bad guy . \nDo you know anything about him ?

afraid and angry . \nThe UN monitors have come to Syria to verify a ceasefire . \nBut the reality on the ground is that although government forces have withdrawn from many areas , attacks are ongoing . \nAnd without a real truce it is difficult to see how any kind of political process can begin . \nGovernment forces also continued to pound rebel-held districts of Homs , with the Syrian Observatory saying that mortar shells were landing at a rate of one a minute in Khaldiya and Bayada on Tuesday morning . \nHoms has been under almost continuous attack since the ceasefire began and some activists are warning there may not be much left to see if the UN observers do not come soon , reports the BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut . \nThe military , tanks and heavy weapons were all supposed to have been withdrawn a week ago under Mr Annan 's peace plan . \nThe opposition Syrian National Council -LRB- SNC -RRB- accused the government of `` flagrant violations of the ceasefire '' and called on the UN observers to `` travel to Idlib and Homs immediately to see first-hand the massacres '' . \nBut the government said that `` armed terrorist groups '' had escalated their attacks leaving the authorities with no choice but to respond . \nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said any ceasefire violation should be met with a swift and firm response by the UN Security Council . \nAddressing an international conference on Syria in Paris , Mr Juppe also said that Western sanctions on the country were having an effect and that its foreign currency reserves had been halved . \nSyria 's foreign reserves were estimated at $ 17bn -LRB- # 10.7 bn -RRB- before the uprising began last year . \nOil production has also been reduced by 30 % , costing the government about $ 520m a month in revenue , according to French diplomats . \nUN Security Council resolution 2042 permits a team of up to 30 unarmed observers An initial group of six monitors has arrived in Syria The rest of the advance team is set to follow later Once certain conditions are met , the UN will seek Security Council approval for an expanded force of about 250 observers Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will set out concrete proposals by 18 April for this larger UN observer force Mr Juppe said the Syrian government was actively trying to evade the sanctions , and called for a solid international response to such `` maneuvers '' . \nBut Russia , which was instrumental in persuading the Syrian government to accept the Annan plan and the ceasefire , seems to be backing the government line in blaming the rebels , our correspondent says . \n`` There are outside forces that are not interested in the success of the current UN Security Council effort , '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said . \n`` They are doing their best to influence the Syrian opposition not to co-operate with the government in maintaining the ceasefire and setting up a future dialogue , '' he added . \nThe Arab League is meanwhile holding a ministerial meeting in Qatar , which Mr Annan is expected to attend to seek support for his plan . \nHowever , the emir of Qatar , which has openly advocated arming the opposition , has given the initiative just a 3 % chance of success . \n`` Earlier , we called for Arab military intervention to find a way out of the Syrian crisis , and spare the Syrian people further bloodshed . \nThe appeals for help from a people oppressed and killed every day are met only with silence , '' Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani said on Monday . \nThe UN says about 9,000 people have died since pro-democracy protests began in March 2011 . \nIn February , the Syrian government put the death toll at 3,838 - 2,493 civilians and 1,345 security forces personnel . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .

{"txt": "Analysis : Iran sees ally Syria surrounded by U.S. , Arab `` wolves '' TEHRAN | Mon Aug 15 , 2011 5:59 am EDT TEHRAN -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Beset by civil unrest at home and lambasted by the West and his Arab neighbors for his violent crackdown on dissent , Syria 's President Bashar al-Assad can count on one firm ally : Iran . \nIn a country that knows a thing or two about diplomatic isolation , Iran 's politicians and media describe the Damascus government as an outpost of resistance to Israel that has been set upon by Washington and its lackeys in the region . \nWhile several Gulf Arab countries have withdrawn their ambassadors in protest at the violence , and countries once close to Damascus , Russia and Turkey , have turned harshly critical , Iran is the only big country still backing Syria , arguing anything else would spell disaster . \n`` In regard to Syria we are confronted with two choices . \nThe first is for us to place Syria in the mouth of a wolf named America and change conditions in a way that NATO would attack Syria , '' said Alaeddin Boroujerdi , head of the Iranian parliament 's foreign affairs committee . \n`` That would mean we would have a tragedy added to our other tragedies in the world of Islam . '' \n`` The second choice would be for us to contribute to the termination of the clashes in Syria , '' Boroujerdi said . \n`` The interests of the Muslim people command that we mobilize ourselves to support Syria as a center of Palestinian resistance . '' \nA senior cleric pressed the message home . \n`` It is the duty of all Muslims to help stabilize Syria against the destructive plots of America and Israel , '' said Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi . \nIran also used troops to put down mass protests following the disputed 2009 presidential election . \nIranian leaders also described those demonstrations as a Western plot . \nIran had hoped the Arab Spring , something Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dubbed the `` Islamic Awakening , '' would spell the end of U.S.-backed autocracies and usher in an era of Muslim unity to face-down the West and Israel . \nKhamenei used the June anniversary of the death of Iran 's revolutionary leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , to tell the nation : `` Our stance is clear : wherever a movement is Islamic , popular and anti-American , we support it . '' \nWithout mentioning Syria by name , he continued : `` If somewhere a movement is provoked by America and Zionists , we will not support it . \nWherever America and the Zionists enter the scene to topple a regime and occupy a country , we are on the opposite side . '' \nMohammad Marandi , an associate professor at the University of Tehran , said Iran 's support for Syria was based on a shared interest in helping resistance to Israel -- both countries support Hamas and Hezbollah -- and that continuing to back Assad while he reforms Syria 's one-party system was imperative . \n`` Iran has always believed that Syria should not be weakened , because the Israeli regime will certainly take advantage of any weakness , '' Marandi told Reuters . \n`` In any case , real reforms can only be carried out in a peaceful environment . \nThe Western and pro-Western Arab media campaign against Syria is intended to destabilize the country and to prevent Syria from implementing reforms that will keep Syria strong and an anti-Israeli government in power . '' \nHe played down media reports of Iran increasing aid to Syria . \n`` I have not heard of any extraordinary aid delivery , except in the Western media or media outlets owned by despotic Arab regimes . '' \nWhile civil unrest in Syria has not gone unreported in Iran , it has received far less attention than uprisings in other parts of the region , particularly Bahrain where Saudi Arabia helped a Sunni monarchy put down protests led by majority Shi'ites . \nIn recent days , as Western media , though banned from working in Syria , have reported a growing death toll , Iranian television has focused more attention on unrest in Britain that some Iranian journalists have described as a `` civil war . '' \nWith Gulf Arab countries turning against Assad , and Turkey , a bridge between the Middle East and the West , taking a tougher stance , Iranian newspapers reflect Tehran 's growing isolation . \nAfter distancing his country from Israel and moving closer to the Muslim world since coming to power in 2003 , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan surprised some in Iran with his volte face . \n`` In Syria , the state is pointing guns at its own people ... Turkey 's message to Assad is very clear : stop all kinds of violence and bloodshed . '' \nThe hardline Qods daily said Turkey , instead of showing support for Syria and Iran , had capitulated to U.S. pressure . \n`` If Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's government does not change its political behavior toward Syria , Turkey will be the main loser of the Syrian events if Damascus gets out of the current crisis , '' it wrote in a recent editorial . \nThe papers reserved their harshest words for Iran 's Gulf Arab neighbors , particularly Saudi Arabia , whose relations with the mostly non-Arab Iran have become increasingly strained in recent months . \n`` Stabbing each other 's backs has now become a custom among Arab countries , like the way they previously betrayed Palestine , Libya , Iraq and Sudan . \nThe current betrayal of Syria should come as no surprise , '' Siyasat-e Ruz daily said in an editorial . \n`` They are still under this illusion that convergence with America can help them preserve their establishment and restore their lost status in the region , '' the conservative paper said . \nThey have turned into puppets for the goals of the West . '' \nReformist daily Arman said Saudi Arabia and Bahrain appeared to be drawing the battle lines for a future regional conflict . \n`` They want to psychologically prepare the atmosphere so that if there is a conflict with Syria and Iran supports it they are standing on the opposite side and against Iran , '' Arman said . \n`` All the countries that want to settle a score with Iran would be happy if Iran entered such a conflict and then , in the name of the international community , they would harm Iran . '' \nThe paper noted the urgent need for Assad to make good on his promised political reforms but with a death toll there which it put at 2,000 , `` it seems late for Bashar al-Assad to get out of this critical situation . '' \nThe reformist daily concluded that it might soon be time for Tehran to rethink its staunch support for Assad . \n`` If the Syria situation continues then it 's time for Iran to think about its long term interests , '' it concluded , saying unconditional support for Assad might leave Iran supporting a government `` that has been thrown out of power ... That can have no benefits for itself or Iran . '' \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe last will be Iran most likely . \nThe propaganda machine is whipped up to get us to hate and fear Iran . \nBut who should we really fear . \nThat little weak country or the power who is producing the war propaganda ... . \nwhere to start with this one . \nHow about with UN conspiracy , for an organization that hasnt done anything productive in decades , I doubt they could form any sort of conspiracy . \nNow for the IMF loans and the US , the IMF is a european based group , so no your answer is still stupid . \nNo as for the `` independent countries '' , they were largely brought down because the government was independent from the people who should have been able to select it . \nOddly enough you probably do n't have a democracy in a country that goes 4 decades without a regime change . \nWhat we should really be afraid of is at the ballot box ur opinion is worth as much as a well thought out one . \nSo , what I take away from this article is that Iran considers Syrians to be sheep . \nThis is not the case . \nIt is interesting to see Iran change their opinion of an `` ally '' at the worst possible time . \nIran is always working for the benefit of Iran . \nWe are always working for the benefit of our country . \nAll countries do the same thing . \nI would like to see the benefit for the United States in Iraq or Afganistan , but can not . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/syriancrisis_reuters/rsd/SyrianCrisis_reuters__2011-08-15__113.rsd.txt"}

Moreno-Ocampo implied , `` the prosecutor 's office has requested the arrest of al-Senussi and Saif al-Islam .

Berman of the Duberstein Group , who was a longtime aide to former vice president Walter F. Mondale before becoming a lobbyist . \nGorelick , who also served as a member of the 9\\/11 Commission , proved critical in coaching the company during tense negotiations with President Obama over the creation of a $ 20 billion escrow fund for spill damages , according to several sources close to the talks . \nWhite House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said Sunday on ABC 's `` This Week '' that the administration `` forced '' BP to set up the fund and to intensify its efforts to contain the spill . \nBut BP has not ignored the GOP , which has been a crucial ally on Capitol Hill in tamping down calls from liberal Democrats to permanently ban drilling or lift liability limits for the company . \nThe London-based energy conglomerate recently hired Anne Womack-Kolton , who was a press secretary for former vice president Richard B. Cheney , to head its U.S. public-relations shop . \nAnd Brunswick has contracted GOP consultants Alex Castellanos and John Feehery to work on behalf of BP , sources familiar with the arrangements said . \nWith nine investigations of the disaster underway , nearly every day has brought a new public-relations crisis . \nOn Sunday , BP defended embattled chief executive Tony Hayward for taking a day off to watch a yacht race . \nEmanuel , in his remarks to ABC , criticized Hayward for a `` long line of PR gaffes and mistakes .

{"txt": "LONDON | Wed Dec 1 , 2010 8:28 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Last month , BP increased by $ 8 billion the financial provisions it was taking for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill ; the company 's shares rose . \nBetter-than - expected underlying profits and upbeat comments from new Chief Executive Bob Dudley were taken by the market as a sign the company had turned the corner and would soon return to pumping out steadily rising dividends . \nKey to this sanguine outlook is confidence that the new estimate of the total cost of the spill -- $ 40 billion -- will be sufficient . \n`` We think that $ 40 billion adequately provisions for the liabilities that are outstanding so far , '' said Mark Lacey , Fund Manager at Investec Global Energy Fund . \nPaul Mumford , fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management , went further , saying the provision is likely to be overly conservative : `` You might well find that you get provision write-backs , '' he said , hinting the bill could be lower . \nThat optimistic view may turn out to be true . \nMr Mumford said : `` I think it would be good news for BP if it does turn out to be true , but I do n't think it will be . \n`` There could be provision write-backs , '' Zygmunt Plater , Boston College Law School , said . \nBut history shows there is ample scope for nasty surprises from BP . \nThe London-based oil giant -- last year it was the biggest non-state controlled oil and gas producer in the world -- has so far consistently underestimated the scope and potential cost of the Gulf spill . \nIt also has a track record of low-balling disasters , including the fatal Texas City refinery blast in 2005 . \nNot only has the company underestimated the cost of repairing equipment and ecosystems in the past , it has also made overly optimistic assumptions about legal challenges . \nThat may be happening again . \nCEO Dudley , an American who took over from Briton Tony Hayward in October , has said a $ 20 billion fund BP created to compensate victims of the spill should cover all damages claims . \nThe lawyers who are suing BP do n't think so . \n`` The total value of the claims already registered could exceed the amount of money that has been dedicated to pay the fund , '' said Texas-based trial lawyer Brent Coon , who represents victims of the explosion and subsequent spill and who was prominent in litigation against BP after Texas City . \n`` Then you have the claims that have not been filed yet , and claims from those indirectly impacted , and shareholder derivative claims ... You have very large potential claims that could , in total , be exponentially greater than the amount set aside . '' \nZygmunt Plater , Professor of Law at Boston College Law School , agrees . \n`` In the short term , it 's in everyone 's interests within the company to low-ball -- but the portents are there for a realistic inflation of $ 20 - $ 50 billon , '' he said . \nAn analysis by Reuters of the potential fines , damages , costs related directly to the leak , compensation and the damage to BP 's business suggests the final spill bill could , over the long term , end up much higher than BP 's latest provision -- perhaps even more than twice as much . \nMuch hinges on whether U.S. courts find the company was `` grossly negligent '' in the run-up to the disaster , but there are other risks . \nBP declined to comment for this article , beyond stating that it stands by its statements on the likely costs and that its estimates are based on the assumption that it was not grossly negligent . \n`` UNPRECEDENTED STRING OF BAD NEWS '' BP 's inability to gauge the true scope of the spill in the early days in April is well documented . \nAfter the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk , following an explosion which killed 11 workers , the company initially hoped to staunch the flow of oil from the well by activating shut-off valves with subsea robots . \nIn case this did n't work , it started drilling a relief well to permanently plug the well from below . \nA week after the blast , the company said the well would take three months to complete and cost $ 100 million -- but that would be the most expensive part of the whole response operation . \nCombining this with the daily expenditure that BP reported at the time suggested a total bill of $ 200 million . \nBP hinted then that even this calculation was pessimistic . \nAs estimates of the spill flow increased -- it eventually became the worst in U.S. history -- so did the cost . \nFrom an initial 1,000 barrels per day to 5,000 bpd , it finally reached 62,000 bpd . \nIn June , BP told analysts the cost of containing and cleaning up the spill would be $ 3-6 billion . \nBy mid-September , the response effort alone , excluding damages claims , had cost BP $ 8 billion . \nInvestment analysts were forgiving of these errors . \nThe disaster seemed to grow worse and worse making accurate estimates difficult . \n`` It was an unprecedented string of bad news , '' Simon Hawkins , oil analyst at Ambrian said last month . \nBut even after the well was capped , BP appeared no more adept at forecasting costs . \nTwelve days after it had sealed the top of the well , on July 27 , the company said the likely cost of the spill would be $ 32 billion . \nOn November 2 , it hiked its estimate by another 25 percent , or $ 8 billion . \nBP 's Chief Financial Officer Byron Grote blamed that increase mainly on a delay in completing the relief well , which meant the company needed to keep its offshore response effort going longer . \nIn a conference call with analysts , he also cited costs related to decontamination of the thousands of ships used in the spill response and undefined administration and legal costs . \nBP did not give a detailed breakdown , but it is hard to see how the delay in the relief well accounted for most of the increased provision . \nAssuming an extra 40 days at the average cash-burn for the operation of $ 60 million per day gives an extra spend of only $ 2.6 billion . \nIn addition to this , the well delay and many extra costs were already clear in July and could have been factored in earlier . \nNonetheless , analysts have largely accepted the company 's estimates . \nPerhaps this is on the assumption that after months of bad publicity , the suspension of dividend payments for at least three quarters , a collapse in its share price to less than half its pre-spill level and a change of CEO , BP would take the opportunity to throw every conceivable cost into the mix and pave the way for recovery under a new boss . \nIt 's a common enough practice when corporations change CEO . \n`` I tend to believe BP . \nGiven how bad it was , they basically decided to kitchen-sink it , '' says Peter Hitchens , oil analyst at Panmure Gordon . \nWHAT HISTORY CAN TEACH US Such an assumption , though , may not be entirely safe in BP 's case . \nThe company 's record of assessing costs after past disasters is less than stellar . \nBP 's Thunder Horse platform in the Gulf of Mexico captured front pages around the world in the summer of 2005 when a hurricane left it listing precariously . \nThe company predicted it would take a year and $ 250 million to repair the damaged platform . \nIn the end , it took almost three years to fix ; analysts estimate BP spent more than $ 500 million . \nThat undershoot was nothing compared with what followed the explosion at its Texas City refinery in 2005 . \nThe blast killed 15 workers and ruined the company 's carefully nurtured reputation as the green and caring face of Big Oil . \nBecause it was a single-point disaster , the cost of Texas City should have been easier to quantify than an ongoing catastrophe like the Gulf spill . \nA gasoline production unit destroyed in the blast would need to be replaced , BP said . \nThe going cost for such machinery was widely agreed to be in the region of $ 100 - $ 200 million . \nA few pessimists added in ancillary damages , lost profits and legal costs to arrive at a total cost of $ 1 billion . \nBut a month after the accident , then-CEO John Browne said the final bill would be `` significantly '' less than that and analysts put the total cost at around $ 300-400 million , a figure the company appeared comfortable with . \nBy 2008 , though , BP had paid over $ 2 billion in compensation claims related to Texas City , while lost profits and repairs had cost another $ 1 billion at least . \nClaims remain outstanding , so the final tally could be even higher . \nIs BP making the same mistake on penalties and compensation again ? \nA `` gross negligence '' finding would require the Department of Justice to show a high degree of recklessness on the part of senior BP officials , rather than a mistake by a low-level worker . \nBP has blamed low-level employees and its contractors for the Deepwater Horizon rig blast . \nOn November 8 , a report by the White House oil spill commission prompted many analysts to assume it was going to be tough to pin gross negligence on BP for the Gulf spill , and BP shares rose as a result . \nThe commission said it had found no direct evidence of `` a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety '' in BP . \nBut the commission 's co-chairmen , Bill Reilly and Bob Graham , subsequently stressed that its November 8 finding did not mean anyone was off the hook . \nThey said a `` culture that did not promote safety '' had fostered misjudgments leading up to the disaster in all the companies involved . \nA panel of scientists conducting another probe for the government subsequently said that BP 's systems for managing drilling risks were inadequate . \nSome lawmakers argue that in BP 's case , the culture created an incentive for employees to short-cut safety precautions without issuing explicitly dangerous orders . \nDavid Logan , professor of law at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island , believes there is no legal reason why a claimant could not establish gross negligence on the part of a corporation based solely on its culture . \n`` Can you stitch together an argument of gross negligence from the corporate culture ? \nIt is possible to do that , '' Logan says . \nIf BP is found to be grossly negligent , the U.S. Clean Water Act allows for a fine of up to $ 4,300 per barrel , nearly four times the $ 1,100 maximum BP otherwise faces . \nThe government estimates 4.9 million barrels of oil flowed from BP 's well , suggesting a maximum fine of $ 5.4 billion if `` gross negligence '' is not proven , and $ 21.1 billion if it is . \nThe company has argued that it should receive credit for the 700,000 barrels of oil which it scooped from the surface or burned , and it disputes the government estimate of the size of the spill . \n`` I think there 's room for considerable discussion there , '' Dudley said last month . \nA close study of company statements suggests BP has factored in a fine below $ 4 billion . \nAs well as adding billions to that , a gross negligence finding would prevent BP from forcing its partners to pay their share of any fine or cleanup costs . \nAnadarko Petroleum , 25 percent owner of the blown-out well , and 10 percent owner , Japan 's Mitsui , have so far refused to pay , saying their contractual obligation to do so is void due to gross negligence on the part of the project operator , BP . \nAny costs BP might recover are not included in its current estimates because accounting rules prevent this , although the company has said it does expect to recoup money from its partners and has reserved the right to sue the companies it hired to help drill the well . \nMost lawyers expect BP and the Department of Justice to reach a settlement that avoids a court ruling on the degree of negligence . \nThe spill -- and President Barack Obama 's inability to halt it -- hurt the president 's ratings . \n`` The government can not let them get away with it . \nAfter President Obama came in with the heavy foot , they just ca n't , '' the chief executive of a rival oil company , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of the spill , told Reuters . \nPlater , the Boston professor , says if the government sought to be aggressive it could attempt to broaden the interpretation of environmental and economic damages that BP must make good . \nOil and fishing dominate employment along the Gulf coast , especially in Louisiana , the state worst hit by the spill . \nWhile most of the fishing bans have been lifted , experts say it will take years for the coast to recover . \n`` There are different ways of measuring natural resource damages and the ecosystem services argument , '' Plater says . \nWhen you knock out an ecosystem , looking at the damage in terms of indirect harm to the economy could carry the cost `` into the hundreds of billions '' . \nBP 's assessments of the environmental damage caused by the spill are at the optimistic end of the spectrum . \nA government report released in August suggested up to 75 percent of the oil had disappeared -- BP has often referred to this report , and former CEO Hayward recently told a gathering of students in Cambridge , England , that all of the spilled oil had gone . \nHowever , researchers at the University of Georgia said in late August that about three-quarters of the oil was still lurking below the surface ; other studies have also pointed to the prospect of severe long-term damage . \nBP will be on the hook to make any such damage good . \nWhatever BP ends up paying in fines and cleanup costs , there could be another big charge : punitive damages . \nSuch a charge would be helped by a finding of gross negligence , though claimants could pursue punitive damages even if gross negligence was n't proven . \nExxon Mobil paid punitive damages of $ 1 per $ 1 of economic damage following the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska when the captain of the tanker , who had been drinking , hit a reef . \nJamison Colburn , Professor of Law at Penn State University , says it is not entirely clear whether the current law covering oil spills at sea will allow punitive damages for BP , though if such damages are allowed , a one-to-one ratio would be in line with precedents like the Valdez . \n`` Punitive damages are a wild card , '' he said . \n`` It 's still an open question . '' \nIn the Texas City case , BP settled all claims out of court , so a judge did not rule on punitive damages . \nHowever , lawyers say the amount paid out in settlements is consistent with an expectation there was a good chance significant punitive damages would have been awarded . \nIf BP were to face punitive damages , given the prevailing estimates of economic damages at around $ 20 billion for the Gulf spill , a fine at the same ratio could add another $ 20 billion to its bill . \nBut trial lawyer Coon says he believes punitive damages could be levied at a higher multiple , because the accusations against BP are greater than those Exxon faced . \n`` In that accident , a drunk captain inadvertently ran his ship onto a reef . \nThe drunk captain was n't doing something at the request of the company , '' Coon said , referring to the arguments which would underpin a gross negligence claim . \nWhat 's clearly not included in BP 's spill estimate is a figure related to the damage the disaster has done to its U.S. business over the long term . \nBP said it lost 30,000 barrels per day of production in the Gulf -- one of its most profitable bases -- in the third quarter , and expected further impacts in the fourth quarter and into 2011 . \nBut the added regulatory scrutiny the oil firm is likely to undergo in the United States will surely add to its operating costs . \nAnalysts at Bernstein say BP 's upstream production costs could rise by 10 percent , or $ 280 million a year . \nUsing the company 's own internal discount rate of 9-13 percent implies the present value of a 10 percent rise in these costs would be $ 2.5 billion . \nIf other areas of BP 's U.S. business faced similar increases , the hit could be twice this . \nIn addition , some lawmakers have called for BP , currently the Gulf 's largest operator , to be banned from future license rounds . \n`` BP may find that when its application for a license goes in , it is put in the ` pending ' file while Shell or someone else gets the license , '' said Iain Armstrong , analyst at Brewin Dolphin . \nTally up fines commensurate with gross negligence , punitive damages at a ratio of just once economic damages , lower production , a 10 percent rise in U.S. operating costs , and difficulties in securing new reserves in the United States , and you quickly reach a figure around $ 50 billion . \nThat may not be as dramatic as it sounds : some costs could still be shared with partners and contractors , many would be tax deductible , and they would in any case probably be payable over many years . \nThe company can likely afford even the most pessimistic estimates . \nBut things might not be as easy today as they were in 2005 . \nBP 's under-clubbing of the costs of Texas City was made up for by a more than doubling of the oil price between 2005 and 2008 . \nThe outlook for crude now is less bullish , which may mean the oil giant has fewer places to hide . \n`` A very slight miscalculation now about what we think is going to happen is magnified by the huge numbers of stake holders -LRB- who could make claims -RRB- , '' said Logan of Roger Williams University . \n`` A billion here , a billion there and pretty soon you 're talking about real money . '' \nDespite BP 's official statements , some industry analysts say the company may be expecting to have to pay more . \n`` The way that they are selling assets and strengthening their balance , is what you would expect them to do if they were preparing for a worse scenario such as a finding of gross negligence , '' said one analyst who asked not to be named because he did not want to be seen questioning BP 's public comments . \nCurrently , analysts predict BP will reinstate its dividend in early 2011 , at half the pre-spill level . \nIf it has n't done its sums right , a return to steady dividend growth from the company could take quite a while longer . \n-LRB- Editing by Sara Ledwith and Simon Robinson -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nU.S. officials and the media offered no help or sympathy , only demonized the company and the situation . \nIf a family member had such a problem , the least one would do is say , `` What can I do to help ? '' \nInstead , the media whips up world opinion against this company . \nI hope our next leadership is far more human and compassionate . \nAnd I can not believe no one has defended them . \nBP has paid and paid and it is time for leaders to offer help and stop the blame . \nJust another journalistic hack job . \nAdds nothing to what is already known . \nJust a lot of speculation and backward looking extrapolation . \nLike the projections that the oil would surround Florida and despoil the east coast . \nIf `` gross negligence '' is the verdict , it would be purely political , anti `` big oil '' , and chauvinistic . \nThe article barely mentions the shared responsibility of Anadarko and Mitsui . \nIt does not mention the shared responsibility of Halliburton , Transocean , and Cameron . \nI 'm not sure where you live or what you do for a living , but the sheer level of your ignorance is staggering beyond comprehension . \nI live on the Gulf Coast and have experienced first-hand the impact of the leak\\/spill ` on the ground ' from ` day one ' . \nHow the hell is doing nothing but finger pointing for over a week , repeatedly underestimating the volume of oil , failing to cooperate with authorities at every turn , saying you 'll do everything you can to keep the oil from reaching shore and then ` taking responsibility ' for cleaning it up after abysmally failing to do so in ANY way being proactive ? \nAs for humane and compassionate ... I can not believe your failing to even mention the 11 human beings who DIED in the sinking inferno of the Deepwater Horizon . \nBP will be lucky if they still exist after the families of the forgotten dead are finished suing them back to the Stone Age . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-12-01__38.rsd.txt.app-auth-final"}
{"txt": "The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Southern Responder participating in cleanup activity in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday . \n-LRB- Reuters -RRB- Despite today 's focus on the response to the the April 20 Gulf Coast oil rig explosion , Obama administration officials stress that federal agencies have been involved since the start . \nPresident Obama said Friday morning that his administration is doing `` everything necessary '' to respond . \nOfficials have classified the situation as an `` incident of national significance , '' officially defined as an event that requires a coordinated response to minimize damage , save lives and plan for long-term economic recovery . \nThe government 's National Response Team -- composed of 16 federal agencies and departments -- coordinates the federal response . \nIn that vein , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson , Energy and Climate Change Policy Assistant Carol Browner and NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco plan to visit the Gulf Coast region Friday to oversee federal efforts . \nNapolitano and Salazar will appear jointly on several of the Sunday morning news shows , the White House said . \nThe government and BP Oil have deployed 1,178 people to the region to protect the Gulf Coast shoreline and wildlife , according to the White House . \nOfficials have established five staging areas -- in Biloxi , Miss. , Pensacola , Fla. , Venice , La. , Pascagoula , Miss. , and Theodore , Ala. -- to protect sensitive shorelines . \nHere 's more agency-specific information -- which will update as necessary : The Coast Guard and BP deployed 76 response vessels , including skimmers , tugs , barges and recovery vessels to assist in containment and cleanup efforts . \nThey 've also sent six fixed-wing aircraft , 11 helicopters , 10 remotely operated vehicles and two mobile offshore drilling units . \nThe public-private response is using 174,060 feet of boom to contain the spill with a total 265,460 feet ordered as of Friday morning . \nTwo C-130 Hercules cargo planes specially designed for aerial spraying have been sent to Mississippi and are awaiting orders to start dumping chemicals on the oil spill , a spokesman told the Associated Press . \nThe Navy also has sent equipment for the cleanup . \nThe agency is monitoring air quality in the region to measure the potential impact of the controlled burn of some of the oil . \nJackson said the agency will consult and consider low tech or no tech solutions for preserving the Gulf Coasts fragile ecosystem . \nNapolitano was the official who declared the spill an '' incident of national significance . '' \nThe department deployed SWAT teams from the Minerals Management Service to inspect 30 drilling rigs operating in the deepwater sections of the Gulf of Mexico . \nInspections should be completed within the next week , according to an Interior Department spokeswoman . \nInspectors will check to see whether the rigs have conducted blow-out preventer tests and inspect related records , the spokeswoman said . \nThe teams will also verify that emergency well control exercises are taking place . \nInspectors will then inspect 47 deep-water production platforms in the gulf , a process that will take longer than rig inspections because of the complexities of the structures . \nAttorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said Friday he is dispatching attorneys from multiple divisions of the Justice Department to New Orleans to meet with the U.S. attorney and response teams and to monitor the oil spill . \nThe team will be led by Ignacia S. Moreno , head of the environment and natural resources division and Tony West , head of the criminal division . \nThe agency is providing on-site support and predicting the oil spill 's trajectory . \nThe Office of Response and Restoration is the agency 's biggest star , conducting overflight surveys to track the oil slick . \nThe National Weather Service is providing weather forecasts to the entire response team and NOAA is consulting the government and BP folks on the potential impact to fish , birds , marine mammals and sea turtles . \nIt 's also using experimental satellite data to survey the marine pollution and will work on determining the full nature and extent of the damage to natural resources and the restoration work needed . \nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton tells NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that any future offshore drilling `` ca n't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars cleaning up these spills . '' \nLeave your thoughts in the comments section below Are the teabaggers going to do anything to get their beloved corporate leaders to clean up the mess they made ? \nOr are they going to be big time hypocrites and demand Obama do something about it ? \nThe spill happened April 20 . \n11 days later , and it is still worsening ? \nI thought we were getting a President that could actually respond to disasters , not lolly gag while things get worse . \nIt is a great summary of the Rep. side of the debate about staying with oil dependency and doing more drilling . \nI am also glad it is about to land on the soil of Rep. states . \nI also know that they `` industries '' effected by this will want government intervention and government money . \nWhich the Rep. will want for `` their '' people . \nJust like farm subsidies . \nRep. cry about government spending when they do n't come up with the idea . \nHope the oil destroys the coast line maybe then people will see the need for Green Energy . \nI live in Pensacola , FL and have lived all my life . \nThe only reason I stay here is because its the only part of the gulf that has n't been raped . \nwhen will you people learn it 's your own fault for not protesting oil drilling in the first place . \nAll you wanted in the early 2000 's was to get cheaper gas prices and now my home and life is the test tube that you people have used to make your pockets deeper . \nMuch better than Bush 's Katrina . \nThere is no cover up in this . \nWe know what we face in this oil spill . \nDo n't deny a another natural malfunction of equipment . \nDo n't EVEN make this sound like Obama 's fault . \nOr any cover up . \nIf it was a cover up , he would n't be in the Rose Garden talking about it . \n-LRB- shades of Bush taking so long with Katrina -RRB- This administration is all over this oil spill . \nOr would you rather have off shore drilling with faulty mechanics . \nDo n't you all have more brains ? \nAnd between this disaster and the disaster in Arizona , you best try to put on a happy face , because it is going to get worse . \nOur entire Gulf Coast will be affected . \n35 years of evolution to correct it all . \nSo anyone `` blaming '' - blame the mechanics of BP And realize what this will do . \nFrom Elway 's 2 restaurants in Denver , to the Seafood Shop in the Hamptons . \nBye bye shrimp and oysters . \nNot REP or DEM . \nyou people ca n't see that our way of life here is worth more to us than just a political debate about who was right . \nThis is our home . \nI 'm not going to dump oil on the white house b\\/c of someones ideas . \nIts every persons problem . \nThe people in the U.S. are to weak to stand together and fight for a common goal . \nStop watching T.V. and complaining about what people you elected are doing . \nOhhh ya it was Bush 's brother who told the oil companies they could n't drill off Florida 's coast so Bush haters can suck it . \nThis is a problem that stems far deeper than your political beliefs Posted by : rallyart2012 | April 30 , 2010 12:27 PM | Report abuse Does anybody not believe that Obama and\\/or his collaborators did n't wish this would happen ? \nHe will stoop to incredible depths to get his way and keep pushing for the elimination of State governments . \nThe timing was just too convenient . \nThis is going to be a very long and devistating 4 years . \nNot , I Obama . \nStop blaming the people you put in office . \nDo Something besides compain about you political peers . \nNot , I Obama . \nStop blaming the people you put in office . \nDo Something besides complain about your political peers . \nNot complaining about what others are not doing . \nGrow up America and start putting our kids futures in our own hands , not others . \nYep ... one person per 8 metric tons of oil spilled and counting . \nBut it 's okay , TheBabeNemo says everything that could be done is being done . \nListen up Babe , Obama wanted off-shore drilling just a few days ago ...

{"txt": "BP and Halliburton knew of Gulf oil well cement flaws US investigator says cement mixture failed three out of four tests carried out before explosion Friday 29 October 2010 08.38 BST Fire burns on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April . \nInvestigators say cement used on the well did not meet industry standards . \nPhotograph : US coastguard\\/EPA BP and Halliburton were aware of flaws in the cement used to seal the doomed well in the Gulf of Mexico , according to the lead investigator for the presidential commission on the oil spill . \nIn a letter to the commission , the investigator , Fred Bartlit , said the cement mixture used on the well did not meet industry standards , and failed three out of four laboratory tests before the Deepwater Horizon explosion on 20 April . \nHalliburton , which was hired by BP to cement the well , learned of those failures in February , and informed BP on 8 March . \nBut both firms chose to go ahead with the nitrogen foam cement mixture , which was supposed to secure the bottom of the well . \n`` Halliburton -LRB- and perhaps BP -RRB- should have considered redesigning the foam slurry , '' the letter said . \nHowever , Halliburton said it did not believe that the foam cement design used on the well caused the incident . \n`` Halliburton believes that significant differences between its internal cement tests and the commission 's test results may be due to differences in the cement materials tested , '' the company said in a statement issued in response to the letter . \n`` The commission tested off-the-shelf cement and additives , whereas Halliburton tested the unique blend of cement and additives that existed on the rig at the time Halliburton 's tests were conducted . '' \nThe company added : `` Halliburton believes that had BP conducted a cement bond log test , or had BP and others properly interpreted a negative pressure test , these tests would have revealed any problems with Halliburton 's cement . '' \nA fourth test , performed in April , did indicate the cement would hold . \nBut Bartlit said BP did not have the results of that test before 19 April , when it ordered work crews to begin pumping cement into the well . \nThe finding offers some good news for BP , whose own investigative report on the spill last month zeroed in on problems in the cement seal performed by Halliburton . \nLike BP 's investigators , the commission conducted its own tests on the cement design used by Halliburton although they had an exact recipe . \nThe mixture failed all nine stability tests . \nThe companies involved in the catastrophic spill BP , Transocean , which owned the rig , Halliburton , and others are engaged in a high stakes fight to shift blame , and millions of dollars in liability , for the explosion and spill . \nBartlit cautioned that the failure of the cement seal alone was not the sole cause for the oil disaster . \n`` The story of the blowout does not turn solely on the quality of the Macondo cement job . \nCementing wells is a complex endeavor and industry figures inform us that cementing failures are not uncommon in the best of circumstances , '' he wrote . \nThe oil industry had developed other common tests to ensure against cement failures , he said . \n`` BP and\\/or Transocean personnel misinterpreted or chose not to conduct such tests at the Macondo well .

{"txt": "Gulf oil spill hearing - as it happened US senators sought answers from the Deepwater Horizon rig 's owners and operators in the wake of the Gulf oil spill disaster The Deepwater Horizon oil rig : millions of gallons of oil pour into the Gulf Preamble : Welcome to the hitherto obscure US Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources , which today is holding hearings on the Deepwater Horizon Gulf oil spill with questions aimed at executives from BP , Halliburton -LRB- remember them ? -RRB- \nand Transocean , the companies that respectively ran , installed and owned the Deepwater rig that exploded on 20 April 20 , killing 11 people and caused oil to spill in great quantities into the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe committee 's witnesses are Steven Newman , head of Transocean , Lamar McKay , president and Chairman of BP America , and Tim Probert , who is the lucky holder of the title of chief health , safety and environmental officer for Halliburton . \nYou can read their prepared testimony here and what we can say so far is that the three companies are adopting what one observer has called `` the Shaggy defense '' - in the words of Senator Robert Menendez , Democrat of New Jersey : `` BP says Transocean , Transocean says Halliburton I can see the liability chase . '' \nFrom the written testimony from the three witnesses , you can see why Menendez might think that . \nHere 's BP 's Lamar McKay -LRB- pdf -RRB- : BP is one of the lease holders and the operator of this exploration well . \nAs operator , BP hired Transocean to conduct the well drilling operations . \nTransocean owned the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and its equipment , including the blowout preventer ... Only seven of the 126 onboard the Deepwater Horizon were BP employees ... Blowout preventers are used on every oil and gas well drilled in the world today . \nThey are carefully and deliberately designed with multiple levels of redundancy and are regularly tested . \nIf they do n't pass the test , they are not used . \nThe systems are intended to fail-closed and be fail-safe ; sadly and for reasons we do not yet understand , in this case , they were not . \nTransocean 's blowout preventer failed to operate . \nThe committee has been off for a recess , to do some actual voting on the financial regulation bill , and now they are up and running ... read on . \n12.00 pm : If you are following these hearings on Twitter , then there 's some excellent live tweeting going on from Kate Sheppard @kate_sheppard and my excellent colleague Suzanne Goldenberg @suzyji , at the hearings itself . \nIf you want to make your life more exciting then watch the whole thing live via the web on C-Span here . \n12.11 pm : More on the blame game , this time the drill owner Transocean blaming Halliburton and BP for something going wrong in the cement plug that was supposed to seal the well . \nHere 's Transocean 's Steven Newman : The cementing process is dictated by the operator 's well plan , and the testing of the cement on the Deepwater Horizon was performed by the cement contractor -LRB- Haliburton in this instance -RRB- as specified and directed by BP ... -LRB- T -RRB- he one thing we know with certainty is that on the evening of April 20 , there was a sudden , catastrophic failure of the cement , the casing , or both . \nTherein lies the root cause of this occurrence ; without a disastrous failure of one of those elements , the explosion could not have occurred . \nIn other words : nothing to do with us , mate . \n12.20 pm : The senators are starting to get unhappy about the blame-game sharing going on here . \nLisa Murkowski from Alaska , a state that knows all about oil wants to stop the Reservoir Dogs style face-off : I would suggest to all three of you that we are all in this together because this incident will have an impact on the energy policy of our country . \nIf you ca n't convince people that you can operate safely , not only will BP not be out there , but Transocean wo n't be out there to drill the rigs and Halliburton wo n't be out there cementing . \nIn other words , get your act together or you 'll spoil it for the rest of us ? \nMurkowski of course is from the `` drill , baby , drill '' wing of the Republican party . \n-LRB- Which implies there 's a non-drilling wing of the Republican party , which there is n't , but some parts are more pro-drilling than others . -RRB- \n12.45 pm : Well if you ever wanted to know anything about deep-sea drilling , you 'll love this hearing . \nAlso , if you like hearing phrases like `` operating procedures '' and `` manipulating the pipe through the BOP '' . \nSometimes some words of English break through . \nSenator Mary Landrieu asks : `` Will BP pay ? '' \nThat is , over and above the $ 75m cap that legislation allows for . \nBP 's McKay : `` We 've been very clear . \nWe are going to pay all legitimate claims , all legitimate claims . '' \nLandrieu : `` Define ` legitimate ' for us ? '' \nExcuse me while I go and short BP shares . \n1pm : Senator Ron Wyden is a bit of hero to many Democrats , and you can see why at this hearing . \nHere he 's grilling BP which he appears to identify as the villain of this piece over their far-from-spotless safety record in recent years . \nAfter Wyden lists some unsafe BP events of recent years , he charges : `` There is a pattern of safety problems at BP . \nWhy has BP not been able to change its corporate culture ? '' \nBP 's McKay responds : `` I 'll acknowledge we 've got issues and we 've got to change some areas of the company ... It gets down to the agenda and the culture of the company . '' \nWyden snorts : `` It sure does ! \nThe culture is that this company has had one accident after another . '' \nSenator Menendez mentions that the room in which the hearing is being held is the same one used for hearings on the sinking of the Titanic : We were told that the Titanic was so technologically advanced that it could n't sink , and we were told that this well was so technologically advanced that it could n't spill . \nUnfortunately both of these technological marvels ended in tragedy . \nIn that case , BP will soon be blaming an iceberg . \n1.05 pm : It should be mentioned that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama is very interested in mud . \nThere are technical reasons why this is important . \nMeanwhile , Kate Sheppard has a good round-up of the intra-mural finger-pointing between the three companies on Mother Jones 's website . \n1.19 pm : Maria Cantwell , Democratic senator from Washington state , goes back to the question of BP 's paying compensation , listing a series of areas where BP might have to cough up . \nBut would BP compensate state and local governments , for example , for lost tax revenue ? \n`` Question mark , '' responds McKay , who is taking most of the heat here . \n-LRB- Have the senators really forgotten about Halliburton 's toxic PR image , hmm ? -RRB- \n1.30 pm : So that brings this part of the hearings to a close - the three execs will now shoot over to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , which might be more exciting since it is n't stuffed with pro-oil state senators -LRB- he said glibly -RRB- . \nAs the hearings wound up , some protesters -LRB- there are a few in the audience -RRB- started an imaginative variation on the old Vietnam War chant : Hey hey , Lamar McKay , who many fish did you kill today ? \nCall me old fashioned but it does n't quite have the power of `` LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ? '' \nRight , we 're in recess until 2.30 pm ET . \n2.30 pm : Here we go again : welcome to part two of the grilling of three oil execs relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . \nCompared to the excitement in the UK with the change of government , this committee meeting might not seem quite as dramatic , but this session promises to be more bare-knuckle than this morning 's round . \nThis one is the environment and public works committee , which contains rather more feisty senators , and chaired by the far tougher Barbara Boxer , who says today that the spill `` could be one of the greatest environmental disasters we 've ever seen '' . \nOnce again the unholy trinity of Halliburton , BP and Transocean are giving testimony , the same three as this morning . \n2.45 pm : The committee 's senators are making their opening statements , and all ready there 's a much tougher tone to their remarks . \nFrank Lautenberg of New Jersey has a nice line : `` What this spill shows us is that offshore drilling can not be conducted safely ... Drilling is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem . '' \n2.55 pmpm : And then again there 's a different view from senator David Vitter of Louisiana , a Republican who knows all about being covered in filth . \n-LRB- That 's a reference to the DC Madam prostitute scandal , when Vitter was found to involved . -RRB- \nAnyway , Vitter thinks that the matter is so serious that these hearings should n't even be held . \n`` I think that having hearings while the disaster is ongoing is a mistake , '' says Vitter , because the hearing is `` pulling some amount of resources and focus away from that ongoing disaster '' . \nNow you might think that 's a pathetic line of argument . \nBut think about it for a minute . \nThen you can be really sure it 's a pathetic line of argument . \nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse , a Democrat of Rhode Island , takes a different line : `` We were told that ` drill , baby , drill ' was the solution to all our problems . \nGo tell that to the tourist industry in Florida . '' \n3.09 pm : Senator Richard Shelby deserves to win a prize . \nA prize for chutzpah . \nIn fact , he 's done even better than Vitter in the chutzpah stakes . \nIn his remarks , he wants to know what was going on at Department of the Interior 's Minerals Management Service . \n`` I 'm just asking , '' he says . \nYes , it was obviously their fault . \n-LRB- He has a point about how badly run the MMS was ... under the Bush administration . \nBut he 's also making a wider point about the ineffectiveness of government , I think . -RRB- \n3.19 pm : Senator Bill Nelson of Florida is getting stuck in , warning of the Deepwater spill : `` one of my worst nightmares might be coming true '' . \nNelson 's now sketching out a nightmarish scenario , in which the oil spill hits an ocean stream in the Gulf , goes around the tip of Florida , up the US east coast and ends up ... on the coast of Scotland ! \nIf only Britain had a government it could do something about this . \nNelson : `` Is it worth the trade off to our economy in Florida , not only to our beaches but our fisheries and our oysters , is it worth the trade off ... for 10 % of the undiscovered oil in the Gulf of Mexico ? \nThe answer is clearly : no. '' Nelson 's also lighting into the MMS : `` A sorry record , a record of incestuous relationships , of sex parties , pot parties . \nMMS needs to be cleaned up . '' \nEverything needs to be cleaned up . \n`` Madam chairman , those are my heartfelt remarks , '' concludes Bill . \n`` They certainly are , '' replies Boxer . \n3.32 pm : Now it 's the chance for the witnesses , starting with BP America 's Lamar McKay . \n`` I grew up in Mississippi ... I know what people are going through , '' he says . \nFaintly , in the breakground , you can hear the Windows XP start-up tune . \n3.38 pm : So now that Britain has a government again it needs to get cracking on that contingency plan for when the Gulf oil slick hits Scotland , as Ben Nelson 's nightmare predicts . \n3.55 pm : Tim Probert of Halliburton now speaking - and we 're back to the blame-game shifting of the morning session . \nShorter version of Probert 's defense : We ca n't possibly make any opinions on what might have happened at Deepwater Horizon rig until all the facts are known . \nExcept that if the blow-out preventer -LRB- BOP -RRB- had worked none of this would have happened . \nBut that 's not what the Transocean people say in their evidence : The attention now being given to the BOPs in this case is somewhat ironic because at the time of the explosion , the drilling process was complete . \nThe well had been sealed with casing and cement , and within a few days , the BOPs would have been removed . \nAt this point , the well barriers the cementing and the casing were responsible for controlling any pressure from the reservoir . \nRemember : Transocean drilled the well , Halliburton did the cement plug . \nNow things are getting interesting : Barbara Boxer : `` Mr Probert , I was taken by your testimony , it seems to be that your blaming the well owner here . '' \nProbert : `` I certainly did n't mean to suggest that , I was just explaining the role of the parties . '' \nFor legal reasons , you will have to speculate on your own interpretation of which of these lying bastards is lying . \nOh god now its Senator Inhofe . \nHe wants to know just how terrific a job they are doing in cleaning up the oil with those nice chemical dispersants . \nNow he 's banging on about how the MMS inspected the Deepwater Horizon 26 times . \nBut otherwise he seems to be speaking in some rustic argot . \n4.10 pm : Senator Lautenberg asks each of the three execs : who was responsible for the explosion and spill ? \n4.14 pm : Sounds like this hearing is n't going to last long because of all the votes the senators have to make on the financial regulations act . \nAnyway ... here 's David Vitter and the thing he 's interested is stopping this terrorist oil from touching the beaches of Louisiana . \nSo he 's going to ask some micro-questions aimed at making sure his state gets more oil boom coverage . \nOf course all politics is local but this is parochialism gone mad . \nThis way , no one asks the nice oil people any awkward questions ... like , why did your rig explode ? \n4.30 pm : Right , so the committee 's gone into recess for voting and its unclear when it will come back to life , so let 's leave it there . \nNo fireworks , certainly nothing on the scale of the Goldman Sachs hearings a couple of weeks ago , perhaps because the spill is still on-going and enough evidence has n't been assembled to really probe the companies involved . \nBen Cardin of Maryland had a good shot at it , asking BP about known safety issues involving blowout preventers that have failed . '' \n`` Obviously in hindsight we did not anticipate something of this impact , '' says McKay . \nSo , replies Cardin , then how can you be sure in the future ? \nMy colleague Suzanne Goldenberg sums up the hearings earlier today , and the blame-all-round policy taken by the oil companies : As the Energy and Natural Resources committee hearing got underway , Senate staffers joked it could be subtitled Scenes from an Execution , with a grilling due from the senators . \nBut some of the worst damage may well have been done by executives themselves , as the three companies all tried to shift the responsibility . \nAnd no Ann Coulter , this is not demographics . \nFollow the latest environment news , comment and analysis on Twitter ", "label": true, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_guardian/rsd/bpoil_guardian__2010-05-11__97.rsd.txt"}

Gerges , Special to CNN Almost two weeks of intense bombings and the enforcement of a no-fly zone in Libya by Western-led forces have neither broken the will of Col.

{"txt": "By Finlo Rohrer BBC News , Washington There have been many devastating images from the Gulf WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE OIL ? \n`` The good news is that oil is a natural product and is relatively easily degraded , '' says Prof Ed Overton , an environmental scientist at Louisiana State University . \nSome of the oil will be picked up by skimmers Oil which has not been dispersed or washed up on shore will be targeted by microbes . \n`` They use the oil as a food , '' says Prof Overton . \nThere is an advantage in that the spill happened in the warm Gulf of Mexico , where conditions are good for decomposition . \nIn colder climes , things can be harder . \n`` Contrast that with Exxon Valdez where you still have beaches where you can kick over cobblestones and still have pools of oil beneath them , '' says Stan Senner , director of conservation science for Ocean Conservancy . \n`` In the Gulf of Mexico it is a different environment . \nThere is some greater capacity for that environment to handle hydrocarbons . '' \nBut that is not to say the oil will totally vanish . \nThe oil has already been spotted in giant clouds of oil floating in the Gulf of Mexico , but it is still too early to say how much of it is reaching the surface . \n`` We have never seen these clouds or plumes of oil dispersed in tiny droplets in the water , '' says Mr Senner . \n`` We do n't know how much is ending up on the bottom . \nOnshore , we do n't know how much is being buried . '' \nWHAT WILL THE EFFECT BE ON THE WETLANDS ? \nThe Gulf Coast 's wetlands are home to a diverse range of wildlife `` The wetlands that are already impacted , if only the stems and the grass you see on the surface are affected then the recovery will be within one or two years , '' says Dr Larry McKinney , director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies . \n`` If the oil has penetrated down to the roots , then you are going to lose those areas altogether . \n-LRB- Wetlands -RRB- will go to open water and will never recover . '' \nIt 's hard at this juncture to tell what the eventual effect will be on the northern Gulf Coast 's habitat . \n`` A coating on the leaves will kill the leaves but it does n't necessarily kill the plant , '' says Prof Overton . \n`` With events like this their impacts occur in different phases , '' says Mr Senner . \nFirst there is the initial wave of deaths , the animals that get covered in oil and die . \nLonger-lived animal populations will take years to recover The death toll Mr Senner is aware of already includes a `` thousand bird carcasses - half of them are oiled , others are just carcasses , a few hundred turtles , 50 or so dolphins '' . \nBut those small numbers reflect the fact that only a small percentage of carcasses are recovered . \n`` The assumption is that the actual mortality rate is many times what has been recovered , '' says Mr Senner . \n`` The rule of thumb for the bird carcasses is that they find one in 10 , but that could be low . '' \nThe question everybody will be asking is how quickly can animal numbers return to normal . \nIt all depends on the life span of the animal . \nIn the Ixtoc spill of 1979 , there was a 60-70 % reduction in shrimp in the year of the spill , but they were back to normal within one or two years , says Dr McKinney . \nThen there are longer-lived animals like dolphins , whale sharks and sea turtles . \nIf a single generation has been largely wiped out , numbers might not fully recover for 10-20 years . \nAnd then there are the truly long-lived organisms . \n`` For deepwater solitary coral communities , their lifespan is in hundreds of years , '' says Dr McKinney . \nWhat will the effect of widespread use of the dispersant Corexit be ? \nWill migrating birds be severely affected ? \nHow much oil has actually been spilled ? \nHow much is buried in fragile wetland habitats ? \nWhat is the effect of oil on deep-sea ecosystems ? \nThey could potentially be vulnerable to the oil or to patches of oxygen-depleted water created by the oil-eating microbes . \nWhen the microbes degrade the oil , oxygen is used up and carbon dioxide is produced . \nDr McKinney is worried about `` huge clouds of low-oxygen oil dispersant mix , -LRB- which is -RRB- methane-heavy '' . \nThe plus side for fish stocks on the other hand is that , severe as the damage might be , it will be mitigated by the break in fishing . \n`` They have closed such large areas of the Gulf that the pressure has been reduced , '' says Dr McKinney . \n`` Reducing the fishing pressure will allow more fish to remain alive and reproduce . '' \nSo stocks of fish like red snapper could be back to normal within two to four years . \nBut , the effect of the spill on species that are already under immense pressure - like Atlantic bluefin tuna - could be severe . \nHOW WILL ECOSYSTEMS BE CHANGED ? \n`` In ecosystems , when you wipe out large segments of them , the ecosystem responds to the absence of those things and other things come in to take their place and you do n't return to the way things were , '' says Mr Senner . \n`` Ecosystems are always dynamic . \nWhat we see in the Gulf of Mexico is an ecosystem that already had a number of stresses on it . '' \nSome animals and plants may be badly affected by the disruption of the spill and not regain their previous place in the ecosystem once conditions return to normal . \nBut they will be replaced by other organisms . \nA lot of the thinking about the effects of the BP oil spill is informed by the work done following the Ixtoc spill of 1979 . \nBut there are some aspects of the latest spill about which scientists find it hard even to speculate . \nMarine biologists will admit that not a great deal is known about the effects of oil on organisms in deep water . \n`` We know almost nothing about the ecology in the deep ocean , '' says Prof Overton . \nIt may offer only a crumb of comfort , but the 2010 spill will one day provide that knowledge . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

{"txt": "Thursday 14 July 2005 00.03 BST In the West Bank and Gaza , portraits of dead suicide bombers and graffiti extolling their deeds are plastered all over walls . \nVideos of their last interviews are on sale on street stalls . \nTheir funerals are occasions for mass mourning . \nAnd , they believe there is no harder way \nAnne Marie Oliver , an American academic who has spent years studying the phenomenon in the West Bank and Gaza , believes the `` star factor '' and the acquiring of glory could also have motivated the Yorkshire bombers . \nThey will not have posters up in Britain or mass mourning , but they will attain glory on internet sites across the Muslim world , according to Ms Oliver , who has co-written with Paul Steinberg the newly published The Road to Martyrs ' Square : A Journey into the World of the Suicide Bomber . \n`` It does not matter whether it is Britain or Syria or the West Bank , they are highly romantic figures , '' she said . \nThe fact that they carried with them credit cards and other personal ID suggests they wanted to be known . \nThe British media has , in the main , demonised the Yorkshire bombers in much the same way as the IRA was in the 1980s and 1990s . \nThe adjectives come readily : fanatics , mad , evil . \nMs Oliver does not believe suicide bombing is a brave act , but , she says , `` I steer away from the rubric of evil . \nYou have to develop a concept of the suicide bomber without either of these extremes '' . \nSuicide bombings , which have their origins in medieval times , can be traced through Japan 's kamikaze pilots to the Iranians during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war , and to the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka . \nThe modern version was developed by Hizbollah and its predecessor during the Lebanese civil war , with attacks on the US and then Israelis , and was refined by the Palestinians in 1994-96 and in the second intifada , beginning in 2000 . \nThe number of suicide bombings has increased in the past five years , a combination of the Palestinian attacks and those in Iraq , where the numbers now outstrip those in Israel . \nMs Oliver said : `` The motives are diverse : religion , nationalism , grievance , fame , glory and money , and , last of all and most important of all , they have to have an entire system that supports their actions -LRB- sympathetic groups round the world -RRB- . '' \nShe said the Yorkshire bombers would not necessarily have needed outside help from al-Qaida and could have gained all the knowledge , including practical advice , they needed from the internet . \nBoaz Ganor , head of the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Herzliya , Israel , disagreed , saying that suicide bombers needed experienced handlers to provide explosives and choose targets . \nHis view is that all suicide attacks worldwide are organised by movements . \n`` If one wants to understand the phenomenon , do not understand the motivation of the perpetrator but the motivation of the organization , '' he said . \nFor organizations , whether Hamas or al-Qaida , the motivation was the same : the suicide bomber is the most effective weapon available . \n`` The suicide bomber is the smartest of smart bombs . \nHe can look around and decide when he can maximize the terror , maximize the casualties , '' Dr Ganor said . \nEven if he is caught , he or she can detonate the explosives , killing those trying to intervene . \nThe figures bear out Dr Ganor 's assessment . \nAccording to Israel , it has faced 160 suicide bombers in the last five years : they account for only 0.6 % of the attacks but half the Israeli casualties - 514 . \nThe movements lock the recruits in , in part through the recording of the final videos for release after the bombing . \nAmong Palestinians , a further factor , one that does not apply in Yorkshire , is poverty . \nThe suicide bomber knows his family will be cared for after his death by various Arab charities and will often be better off than before . \nThe family will also enjoy greater prestige . \nMost of the bombers tend to be young , well-educated , and from lower middle-class backgrounds rather than those fighting for daily survival . \nAn Israeli government study found that 23 % of suicide bombers between 2000 and this year had been university graduates . \nTheir families , like those in Yorkshire , were often unaware of their intentions . \nDr Ganor said that religion was the predominant motive . \n`` He believes he is carrying out God 's will . \nThey do not call it a suicide but shuada , martyrdom . \nThey believe they do not die : they just transfer from life to heaven , a one-way ticket . \nAnd they believe there will be 72 virgins that serve them . '' \nBut religion is not the sole explanation . \nThe Tamil Tigers were just as eager for self-sacrifice but were not motivated by religion . \nIt was a matter of revenge , a way for the powerless to fight back , to create fear . \nThere is a desire among jihadists for revenge over what is seen as the brutal treatment of fellow Muslims : Russia 's suppression of Chechnya , the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank , and the US and British role in Iraq . \nToby Dodge , one of Britain 's leading academics specialising on Iraq , said that Iraq has had a bigger impact on British Muslims than Chechnya or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . \n`` How Iraq is different is that Americans and British are killing Muslims . \nIf you are a radical imam trying to mobilise a set of poorly integrated Yorkshire youths of Pakistani origin , it is a much more potent message to say the Americans and British are killing Muslims , '' Dr Dodge said . \nMs Oliver said that one of the most important motivating factors was what she described as `` an element of ecstatic camaraderie , which is central to the group '' . \nShe believed the Yorkshire bombers shared the happiness of camaraderie . \n`` The people we studied , a Hamas cell , described their time before their death as the happiest day of their life . \nWhat I have read of the London bombings , police officers described the three guys on CCTV as looking as if they were going on holiday , '' she said .

{"txt": "POINTE-AUX-CHENES , LA. -- The best thing about this place -- where the dry land of south Louisiana gives up , and marshes and bayous stretch away to the Gulf -- used to be that white people had so much trouble finding it . \nHere , a French-speaking Indian tribe has lived for more than a century , isolated from a world that had proved itself unfriendly . \nBut the oil found its refuge in a month and a day . \nNow , this tribe is feeling an especially sharp version of Louisiana 's despair . \nIts members worry that the oil will kill the marsh , and seethe at the idea that a bitter history now seems to be getting worse . \n`` They come in and take our land . \nNow , the oil 's taking over . \nIt 's like it 's happening all over '' again , said Grace Welch , 26 , in a stilt-legged house across the street from the bayou . \nAcross the plywood-floored living room , her father was fantasizing about killing Christopher Columbus . \n`` They shoulda hang him , '' said Sidney Verdin , 60 . \nHe meant the native people who encountered Columbus , the first scout of the civilization that would eventually drill an oil well 5,000 feet under the ocean and then not know how to fix it when it broke . \nThe Pointe-au-Chien tribe lives west of the Mississippi River mouth , more than 100 miles by water from the spot where the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and sank . \nHeaded here from New Orleans , the road branches and narrows until it is two lanes hugging a cola-colored bayou where alligators hide . \nThe tribe lives where the road ends . \nOn Tuesday , in the shaded space under a house on stilts , chief Charles `` Chuckie '' Verdin -LRB- pronounced `` VUR-dan , '' a common name in the roughly 680-member tribe -RRB- , 53 , recounted watching the TV news when BP gave up its attempt to completely kill the leaking well . \n`` I just stayed there and looked at it , '' said the chief , a deeply tanned man wearing a camouflage T-shirt , as stray kittens played around his feet . \n`` Going through my head -LRB- was -RRB- , ` This is going to get a lot worse . ' '' \nThe tribe is not recognized by the federal government , and its name is proof of its still-murky history : The tribe 's official name is French for `` Dog Point . '' \nBut others nearby asserted that the right name was the more genteel Pointe-aux-Chenes , `` Point of Oaks , '' and that 's the name on the local school . \nIn Cajun French , both names sound like `` Point ahw-shen . '' \nThe tribe says it has lived in this region for more than a century , one of a group of tribes that escaped into the bayous as Manifest Destiny roared by . \nBut , for a century now , the swamp has done a progressively worse job at keeping bad things away . \nIn the early 1900s , Louisiana 's growing oil industry managed to gain control of tribal lands for drilling wells . \nAnd flood-control measures reduced the sediment deposits that kept the land above water : Homes and cemeteries were abandoned .

{"txt": "May 23 : An oil-covered pelican flaps its wings on an island in Barataria Bay off the coast of Louisiana . \nAP2010 WASHINGTON -- Responding to the massive BP oil spill , Congress is getting ready to quadruple -- to 32 cents a barrel -- a tax on oil used to help finance cleanups . \nThe increase would raise nearly $ 11 billion over the next decade . \nThe bill would raise nearly $ 11 billion over the next decade . \n`` We are going to increase the tax to 32 cents a barrel , '' Levin said . \nThe revenue goes to a fund managed by the Coast Guard to help pay to clean up spills in waterways , such as the Gulf of Mexico . \nThe tax increase is part of a larger bill that has grown into a nearly $ 200 billion grab bag of unfinished business that lawmakers hope to complete before Memorial Day . \nThe key provisions are a one-year extension of about 50 popular tax breaks that expired at the end of last year , and expanded unemployment benefits , including subsidies for health insurance , through the end of the year . \nThe House could vote on the bill as early as Wednesday , though Democrats were still working Monday to round up the votes . \nDemocratic leaders had wanted to hold a vote Tuesday . \nThere has been little public opposition to the oil tax from the petroleum industry . \nBut the overall bill would add about $ 134 billion to the federal budget deficit , drawing opposition from Republicans and some Democrats . \nSenate leaders hope to complete work on the bill before Congress goes on a weeklong break next week . \nThe Obama administration issued a statement Monday supporting the bill . \nLawmakers want to increase the current 8-cent-a-barrel tax on oil to make sure there is enough money available to respond to oil spills . \nAt least 6 million gallons of crude have spewed into the Gulf of Mexico since a drilling rig exploded April 20 off the Louisiana coast . \nPresident Barack Obama and congressional leaders have said they expect BP to foot the bill for the cleanup . \n`` Taxpayers will not pick up the tab , '' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev . \nBP executives told Congress last week they would pay `` all legitimate claims '' for damages . \nBut the government needs upfront money to respond to spills , as well as money to pay for cleanups when the responsible party is unable to pay , or is unknown . \nMoney spent from the fund can later be recovered from the company responsible for the spill . \nThe Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund has about $ 1.5 billion available . \nUnder current law , only $ 1 billion can be spent from the fund on a single incident . \nThe bill would increase the spending limit to $ 5 billion . \nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the tax increase was hastily put together , without adequate study , to help pay for an unrelated bill . \nThe tax increase was unveiled Thursday , without any congressional hearings to study its impact . \n`` I have seen no analysis on how this would impact energy security , how this would impact domestic production , how this would impact the overall economics in the country , '' said Christopher Guith , vice president of the chamber 's energy institute . \n`` There has n't been any sort of deliberation on this . '' \nGuith said the tax could be passed on to consumers , depending on the ability of oil companies to raise gas prices in response to a tax increase . \nLawmakers felt the tax increase , to 32 cents a barrel , was reasonable , said Rep. Sander Levin , D-Mich . \n, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee . \n`` We just decided to take a look at what we thought would be a reasonable increase , '' Levin said . \nThe American Petroleum Institute has not taken a position on the tax increase , though a spokeswoman said Congress should study the ramifications before acting . \n`` We understand we need to have an insurance policy in order to cover people in the event of a spill , '' said the spokeswoman , Cathy Landry . \n`` At the same time we need to have a vital oil and gas industry . '' \nThe bill does not address a federal law that caps liability at $ 75 million for economic damages beyond direct cleanup costs . \nDemocratic Senators tried to pass a bill last week that would have increased the cap to $ 10 billion , but they were blocked by Republicans . \nThe oil industry says such a high cap would make it difficult , if not impossible , to insure oil rigs . \nBP said Monday its costs for responding to the spill had grown to about $ 760 million .

I forgot the Constitution does not apply to Obama ... because he is a Dual Citizen and not a Natural Born Citizen . . \nIt 's like something crawling out of a sewer . \nTomorrow evening our President will talk to the nation about the situation in the gulf , and I hope everyone listens to it with an open mind . \nYou may not agree with or approve of everything he says , but at least you 'll know what he said , the whole context , rather than a snippet or two featured by some commentator , who then tells you his opinion . \nThere are too many comments that display ignorance of the events and the President 's handling of the crisis to date . \nLet 's all inhale slowly and review the facts - The US gov ' t did n't cause this spill , BP did - focus the anger towards them . \nGod knows they earned it . \nIf President Obama had directed gov ' t resources to clean up the mess the same idiots that are decrying him now would be screaming that he is bailing out a corporate giant . \nGive it a rest fellas . \nObama 's problem is pure and simply that he has forgotten that perception is reality and that he is perceived as putting fundraising , listening to Paul warble through yet another silly love song and long weekends ahead of the salvage operation . \nYou can be sure that a lot of lower people were working on this problem out of sight of cameras . \nSadly , Obama performing as Nero took center stage . \nWell apparently now that the President is a Democrat , he is only human and can only do so much . \nThe left in this country and the media have themselves to blame for the unreasonable expectations and disdain for this president . \nAfter all it was the constant criticism of Bush that anything and everything was his fault . \nAdd in the wonder of Obama 's specialness and it is hardly a surprise that people expected so much . \nSome of us , however are not surprised or disappointed by his failure to perform even competently , much less miracles . \nIn 2002 - we got editorial after article about Bush playing too much golf when he should have been working on addressing a spate of suicide bombings in Israel . \nObama has played more golf in 2 years than Bush in 8 and we have a huge disaster threatening industries and livelihoods of Americans in the Gulf of Mexico . \nAnd the Post says `` who cares '' . \nPlease never again try to argue that the Washington Post is not biased to the left . \nWe also know that the Washington Post took gread exception to President Bush playing Golf . \nDoes this derogatory article by the Post ring a bell . \nMichael Moore used Bush 's golfing which was far less that Obama 's in a Movie to mock Bush . \nThe leftists hacks at the Post are to the point of being cartoon characters in their excuse making and covering up for a failed President . \nYou people are a joke . \nThe gulf is being destroyed and obama plays and plays . \nA real leader would be on the front lines continually working on this . \nobama has proven himself to be completely inept . \nAnd so has this writer . \nFind something else besides opinion , because yours is worthless . \nIt would keep him from flying his private 747 all over the country to fund raisers , rigged town hall shows and photo ops . \nAt least Andrews is close to the people 's house , I mean 0bamba 's house , sorry . \nWith the first ladies garden providing food for him and the family and Andrews Air Force Base so close we can only hope that he stops his takeover of our representative Republic . \n`` We the people '' will start the very difficult task of taking back America on November 2 , 2010 , bet on it . \nInstead of his daily state run media\\/teleprompter speeches I can handle hearing `` FORE '' . \nMuch less damage to the United States of America . \nThe grounds keepers might get upset at Andrews but they have nothing to complain about , they are government workers , make a lot more than private sector workers so it 's works out better for everyone . \nWELL , except maybe for tax payers ...

{"txt": "Is the furore surrounding the memoirs of our former man in Washington justified ? \nAndrew Stephen examines Christopher Meyer 's DC Confidential Weidenfeld & Nicholson # 20 , pp301 Becoming Britain 's ambassador to Washington is invariably the high point of a diplomat 's career . \nFive have occupied the faux Queen Anne ambassadorial residence on Massachusetts Avenue since I went to Washington to become The Observer 's correspondent there in 1989 , all with varying success : Sir Antony Acland -LRB- 1986-91 -RRB- returned to become provost of Eton , Sir Robin -LRB- now Lord -RRB- Renwick -LRB- 1991-95 -RRB- to write a learned tome on Anglo-American relations , and Sir John -LRB- now Lord -RRB- Kerr -LRB- 1995-97 -RRB- to become permanent under-secretary at the foreign office . \nThe fourth , Sir Christopher Meyer -LRB- 1997-2003 -RRB- , went back to London to become chairman of the Press Complaints Commission and to publish these tell-all memoirs , which , the publisher confidently informs us , will do for diplomacy what Alan Clark 's did for politics . \nMeyer was once press secretary to John Major , and so few will better understand the peculiarly British nature of the briefings that began last week : that Meyer has breached the sacred trusts of government , that he is doing it solely for the money and to settle old scores , and that his chairmanship of the PCC is now untenable . \nAll of which may or may not be true . \nBut hell , it seems , hath no fury quite like that of a scorned Prime Minister , especially after a master practitioner of Establishment wiles like Meyer managed to outsmart Tony Blair by giving the cabinet office just days to review this book before rushing it into print . \nSir Jeremy Greenstock , Meyer 's ambassadorial colleague at the UN during the run-up to the Iraq war , gave the government longer and paid the price ; his apparently equally revealing book , The Costs of War , will now not be seeing the light of day on the personal orders , we are told , of Jack Straw . \nWhat other Western country , I wonder , so freely tolerates such censorship ? \nPerhaps we should not be surprised . \nMeyer 's detailed account of Blair 's life in the White House is not only rich in details about his time in Washington . \nWe learn how the Prime Minister ` pulsed with ill-suppressed excitement ' during his first official visit to the US ; how he put on ' a pair of ball-crushingly tight dark-blue corduroys ' after ` intensive debate within No 10 ' on what was meant by informal dress ; and of the near-catastrophe when Mrs Blair 's hairdresser was left behind at Camp David , averted only when a chopper was sent for him ` as the rest of us kicked our heels ' . \nBut such knockabout stuff would be mere cruel diversion were the book not also a tragic indictment of the dysfunction of 21st-century British government - the marginalisation of the Foreign Office and the soaring ascendancy of Blairite courtiers - and of the dangers of voting into office a party whose leader had nil governmental experience . \n` We want you to get up the arse of the White House and stay there , ' is the instruction Meyer says he received from Blair 's chief of staff , Jonathan Powell . \nIndeed , bitterness and resentment pulse through this book once Blair starts to stalk its pages . \nMeyer 's version of history is that he and the Foreign Office were soon jettisoned in favor of the superstar politicking to which Blair gravitated ; that , in the year leading up to the Iraq invasion , his embassy warned London of the defective plans Washington was making and its rudimentary notions of how the country would be administered after Saddam . \nMeyer concedes that he was in favor of invading Iraq and even that he found George W Bush ` as smart as a whip ' , but believes that Downing Street had a vendetta against the embassy which ultimately led to its fatal misjudgments . \nWe will not know how much of this is justified until government papers are released sometime in the 2030s , or until and when Greenstock and other privileged insiders are free to have their say , too . \nWhat is clear , though , is that Blair simply failed to comprehend that neocons such as Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle , whom Meyer says Colin Powell privately dismissed as ` fucking crazies ' , saw Iraq as ` the anvil on which they could forge a realignment of the Middle East ' , and that Britain was being inexorably dragged down their path . \nThose same neocons also see a strong Europe as a threat to American hegemony , and Meyer describes how Rupert Murdoch and senior Republicans complained to him over dinner about Britain 's ` appeasement ' towards France ; such mutterings from the American right alone , it seems , were soon enough for Blair to abandon Churchill 's long-held strategy that British support for a powerful US must be balanced by strong ties to both Europe and the Commonwealth . \n` Blair 's famous bridge between Europe and America , ' Meyer notes , ` was sinking beneath the waves . ' \nHis central thesis , though , that ` the ace up our sleeve was that America did not want to go alone ' into Iraq , simply does not stand up . \nBritain has always relished the deceit that , when it comes to the so-called special relationship , it plays the role of the cultured and intellectually superior Athenian murmuring words of wisdom into the ear of the mightier but uncouth Roman . \nThe truth is that Washington 's ear always remains resolutely deaf unless what is said is something it wants to hear . \nBlair mouthed only sweet nothings but America would still have stormed to war with or without Britain , as Donald Rumsfeld made derisively clear at the time . \nMeyer , besides , has done himself no favors with this book . \nHe emerges not so much as the Sir Crispin Mandarin of Private Eye parody but more , sometimes , as Dame Sylvie Krin . \nEccentrically , he habitually wore red socks and he and his wife captivated Washington in a way I have never seen - perhaps the Blairites were jealous ? \n- but we read too much about his laddish ways , such as how he was ` looking at Catherine 's legs ' at the British embassy in Bonn while ` she sensed my eyes boring into her calves like red-hot pokers ' . \nWhat would now be fascinating to read would be the memoirs of the fifth occupant during my time of what Meyer repeatedly calls that Great House - those of Sir David Manning , the present ambassador . \nHe straddled the roles of Foreign Office diplomat and inner-cabal adviser and was at Blair 's side throughout the build-up to war and beyond . \nMeyer , in fact , is still beside himself that he learned Manning was to succeed him not from the British government , but from Washington . \nSo does Blair , I wonder , now listen to Manning any more than he did to Meyer ? \nDoes Manning agree that the role of the British ambassador is to stay up the arse of the White House ? \nAnd what would Manning himself make of Bush ` splitting his sides ' when he learns that a character in a film is called Gay Focker ? \nDid he relish his ambassadorial task introducing Cherie Blair on the stage of the Kennedy Centre when she was promoting her money-spinning book ? \nWe would all love to know . \nBut given the experiences that have befallen both Greenstock and Meyer in Blair 's brave new Britain , I very much doubt whether we will . \nEducation Lancing College ; Lycee Henri IV , Paris ; Peterhouse College , Cambridge ; Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , Bologna . \nCareer Ambassador to Germany -LRB- Mar-Oct 1997 -RRB- ; Ambassador to the US -LRB- 1997-2003 -RRB- ; chairman , Press Complaints Commission -LRB- 2004-present -RRB- . \nFamily Married to Lady Catherine Laylle . \nOn Blair : ` He liked the vision thing , but he was n't interested in the ballast behind the ideas .

{"txt": "Explosions , gunfire heard overnight in Tripoli Gadhafi supporters rally in Tripoli Gadhafi vows to counter `` naked aggression '' Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Explosions and anti-aircraft fire thundered in the skies above Tripoli early Sunday , but it was not clear whether they resulted from another round of cruise missile attacks by allies determined to stop Moammar Gadhafi 's offensive against Libyan opposition forces . \nCNN 's Nic Robertson witnessed the development a few hours after nearly 1,000 people gathered at Gadhafi 's palace in the capital . \nThe crowd chanted , waved flags and shot off fireworks in support of the government . \nA defiant Gadhafi said Libya will fight back against undeserved `` naked aggression . '' \n \n\u2018 CNN could not verify the unconfirmed account \nThere was no independent confirmation of that statement . \nAmerican , French and British military forces , convinced that Gadhafi was not adhering to a United Nations-mandated cease-fire , hammered Libyan military positions with missiles and fighter jets in the first phase of an operation that will include enforcement of a no-fly zone . \nGadhafi responds to air strikes Gallery : Civil war in Libya An eyewitness in Tripoli reported seeing signs of gunfire rising Sunday morning from the direction of nearby Mitiga Airport . \nThe anti-Gadhafi activist said she heard `` continuous gunshots '' and at least two loud explosions . \nIt was not clear if the airport was also being used as a military installation . \nThe eyewitness , who was not identified for security reasons , said she did not hear the sound of flying aircraft . \nMore than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired from American and British ships and submarines hit about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets in western portions of the country , U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing . \nThe U.S. will conduct a damage assessment of the sites , which include SA-5 missiles and communications facilities . \nA senior U.S. military official , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the cruise missiles , which fly close to the ground or sea at about 550 miles per hour , landed near Misrata and Tripoli . \nThe salvo , in an operation dubbed `` Odyssey Dawn , '' was meant `` to deny the Libyan regime from using force against its own people , '' said Gortney . \nU.S. Navy photos showed flashes of light and smoke funnels as missiles soared from a destroyer into the night sky . \nEarlier , French fighter jets deployed over Libya fired at a military vehicle Saturday , the first strike against Gadhafi 's military forces , which earlier attacked the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \nPrime Minister David Cameron said late Saturday that British forces also are in action over Libya . \n`` What we are doing is necessary , it is legal and it is right , '' he said . \n`` I believe we should not stand aside while this dictator murders his own people . '' \nBritish Defense Secretary Liam Fox said the Royal Air Force deployed Tornado GR4 fast jets , which flew 3,000 miles from the United Kingdom and back , `` making this the longest-range bombing mission conducted by the RAF since the -LRB- 1982 -RRB- Falklands conflict . '' \nWhile there were no U.S. warplanes flying over Libya late Saturday , the coalition was softening Libyan positions before enforcing a no-fly zone , Gortney said . \nThe Libyan military , in a statement broadcast on state TV , said , `` An enemy attacked the state on March 19th with rockets ... Those enemies killed 48 martyrs -- mostly women , children , and religious clerics . \nThey left more than 150 injured . \nThe majority of these attacks were on public areas , hospitals and schools . \nThey frightened the children and women near those areas that were subject to this aggression . '' \nLibya forces advance on main rebel base Gadhafi , speaking early Sunday on Libyan state TV , said the U.N. charter provides for Libya 's right to defend itself in a `` war zone . '' \nWeapons depots will be opened , he said . \n`` All you people of the Islamic nations and Africa , and Latin America and Asia , stand with the Libyan people in its fight against this aggression , '' Gadhafi said . \nAir attacks on several locations in Tripoli and Misrata have caused `` real harm '' to civilians , a Libyan government spokesman said . \nAn eyewitness in Misrata said Gadhafi 's forces are targeting fuel and power stations in an effort to make citizens believe the damage is being done by coalition forces . \nThe eyewitness , who was not identified for security reasons , said people celebrated allied airstrikes on loyalist positions in the city . \nCNN could not verify the account . \nShortly after the first missile attacks , U.S. President Barack Obama informed the American people of the efforts by a `` broad coalition . '' \n`` The use of force is not our first choice , '' the president said from Brasilia , Brazil . \n`` It is not a choice I make lightly . \nBut we can not stand idly by when a tyrant tells his own people that there will be no mercy . '' \nObama is planning for the U.S. portion of the military action in Libya to only last for a few days , according to a senior administration official , who was not authorized to speak about sensitive military matters . \n`` After that we 'll take more of a supporting role , '' the senior official said . \nObama authorized U.S. military force from Brazil on what happened to be the eighth anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq . \nCoalition partners say Gadhafi has failed to adhere to a United Nations resolution that imposed the no-fly zone and ordered him to stop attacks on civilians . \n`` He 's clearly been on the offensive , '' the senior U.S. military official said of Gadhafi . \n`` He said that he was going to do a cease-fire and he continued to move his forces into Benghazi . '' \nEarlier Saturday , Gadhafi issued defiant messages to international powers . \n`` I have all the Libyan people with me and I 'm prepared to die . \nAnd they are prepared to die for me . \nMen , women and even children , '' Gadhafi said in a letter addressed to Obama and read to reporters by a government spokesman in Tripoli . \nObama , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gortney used the term `` unique capabilities '' to describe the U.S. part of the effort . \nOfficials have said American military forces are meant to augment Arab , European and other Western troops . \nIn the next few days , U.S. military officials expect to hand over control to a coalition commander . \nCanada and Italy also are part of the coalition . \n`` Our air force will oppose any aggression by Colonel Gadhafi against the population of Benghazi , '' said French President Nicolas Sarkozy , speaking after a top-level meeting in Paris over the Libyan crisis . \nThe international meeting -- which included Western and Arab partners -- focused on how to take on a Libyan government bent on destroying the fledgling opposition movement under the U.N. resolution authorizing force to protect civilians against the Gadhafi government . \nRebel forces in Benghazi used a captured army tank as a victory symbol , CNN 's Arwa Damon reported . \nEarlier Saturday , incoming artillery rounds landed inside Benghazi , and pro-Gadhafi tanks rolled into the town firing rounds , witnesses said . \nA flaming fighter jet plummeted from the sky , nose-diving to the ground . \nKhaled el-Sayeh , the opposition military spokesman , said the plane was an old MiG-23 that belonged to the rebels . \nAs night fell over Benghazi on Saturday , the city became quiet and calm . \nWhile plumes of smoke could be spotted , the pro-Gadhafi tanks seen earlier were not in sight . \nEl-Sayeh told CNN that `` tens '' had been killed in Benghazi on Saturday . \nHe said Gadhafi forces had withdrawn from the city and that they were positioned 50 kilometers -LRB- 31 miles -RRB- outside Benghazi . \nCNN could not independently verify those details . \nGadhafi -- in a separate letter addressed to Sarkozy , Cameron and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- called the U.N. moves `` invalid '' because the resolution does not permit intervention in the internal affairs of other countries . \nViolence has raged in Libya following protests calling for democracy and freedom and demanding an end to Gadhafi 's almost 42-year-long rule . \nIt 's a conflict spurred by anti-government protest and resulting regime violence against civilians -- which the U.N. resolution cites as `` outrageous '' and Sarkozy calls `` murderous madness .

{"txt": "Why does n't Obama ` take charge ' of the BP oil spill ? \nFor an Obama administration spokesman on the BP oil spill , Adm. Thad Allen , the Coast Guard commandant and national incident commander , is admirably straightforward . \nWorking on behalf of the president who ran a campaign based on the mantra , Yes We Can , Allen awkwardly insists that , in this case , no , the government can t . \nThere are very few circumstances where the government does not have the means or national power to influence something this large , Allen said said in an interview with me at the White House on Wednesday . \nI think that s a source of immense frustration to everybody . \nCommentators increasingly lambaste the administration for not taking over the cleanup effort . \nIn a politically calculated response , some administration officials have ratcheted up their rhetoric about keeping the federal government s boot on BP s neck ; they have now threatened to push BP out of the way , which just fuels the anger . \nBut what many of the critics , inside and outside the administration , don t offer is much sense of what the federal government could really do better if it pushed BP aside , other than symbolic actions of questionable value , such as insisting that President Obama visit the Gulf of Mexico again and , as James Carville put it Wednesday , take control , whatever that means . \nHow long will it take for BP to clean up the Gulf of Mexico ? \n`` A large part of the leak is still spewing oil , '' Allen said . -RRB- \nUnder the water and on the surface , Allen says , there simply isn t much that the federal government can add to what BP is already doing , beyond providing some supplemental brain power , advanced imaging technologies and review of BP s proposals to plug the leak . \nThings the government has already furnished . \nThe private sector owns nearly all the means to deal with this problem and fix the leak and stop the source . \nWhy doesn t the Coast Guard bring in its own submersibles ? \nThere s too much submersible traffic underwater already , he says . \nA couple of remote operated vehicles even got tangled inserting a tube to collect spewing oil , lengthening the operation . \nWhy hasn t the government quickly approved a plan Louisiana officials favor to build sand berms that might protect sensitive wetlands ? \nBecause it would take months to execute , anyway . \nEven so , it s undergoing requisite review at the Army Corps of Engineers . \nPerhaps BP is the one with the technological capabilities on and under the water . \nBut on land , why isn t the federal government in full control of the cleanup ? \nIt essentially is , Allen argues , since Coast Guard officials are the ones making the top-line decisions and coordinating the effort . \nBy law , he says , BP is responsible for cleaning the mess and hires contractors created after the Exxon Valdez spill that specialize in doing just that . \nBut the federal government is responsible for supervising and ensuring the cleanup is effective . \nSo , according to Allen s reckoning , Americans should at least feel free to hold the administration accountable for how well the cleanup proceeds , even if it might be a tad unfair to blame Obama for BP s inability to plug the leak for more than a month . \nThere are some problems that simply can not be fixed quickly , no matter who is in charge . \nBut on shore , Allen points out , BP and the government have fewer restrictions on how they can react once oil is sighted . \nThat implies more responsibility , particularly since the government is , apparently , taking such an active role . \nThat will be little comfort to the angry Louisianans who lined up Tuesday at a town hall meeting in Plaquemines Parish to yell at officials about what they perceive as government inaction . \nNor will it help the administration s press operation , which would surely prefer to have BP as an enemy rather than as a partner . \nBut , like it or not , BP is the administration s right hand in this effort , a fact Allen has made clear for days . \nIndeed , part of the reason the administration 's messaging on the oil spill falls flat is that some officials attempt to play political defense by excoriating the company , even while it must admit that BP is its partner of necessity . \nIn so doing , the Obama administration legitimizes unfocused and perhaps unfair complaints about the organization of its effort to cap and clean up the oil leak , even though , according to Allen , the White House probably couldn t do much of substance to redress many of those very criticisms . \nThe White House is in a hard spot . \nThe president will probably take a hit for this , fair or no , no matter what administration spokespeople say . \nAll the more reason to be straight with Americans , as Allen seems to be , about what the government can and can t reasonably be expected to do . \nThe truth is nobody knows whether or not the administration is not doing all it can . \nBut like in any crisis the lack of knowledge does n't stop anyone from having a strong opinion . \nThe smartest thing this administration has done is to STAY OUT OF THIS with regard to management ! \nWith all due respect to the severity of this situation , even the EXPERTS in oil extraction and exploration are at odds as to what to do . \nDo you seriously want the government to take the reigns -LRB- and therefore the responsibility -RRB- away from areas those industries that have spend decades becoming familiar with ? \nWe all want this thing to end , but to panic and grab the wheel away from the driver is THE WRONG thing to do . \nPerhaps the government should make itself available to these industries with regard to equipment and manpower , but certainly NOT direction ! \nWhere 's the White House on that ? \nOh , that 's right , a number of states on the Gulf have REPUBLICAN governors . \nThat is too cute on the White House 's part to allow the states to beg for help . \n-LRB- Bobby Jindal of Louisiana is in such a spot . -RRB- \nRather crude and unprofessional for this White House . \nWe are as mad as hell ! \nClean this mess up ! \nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar appeared May 18 , 2010 , for several Senate hearings . \nMany lawmakers examined the leadership of the Minerals Management Service . \nThe Interior Department is charged with enforcing environmental and safety rules for energy exploration . \nKen Salazar was working on the Cape Wind commercial wind turbine permit while the Gulf oil platform was on fire ! \nSoon after the platform sank into the Gulf Ken traveled to Massachusetts to announce that he had approved the Cape Wind permit ! \nOn April 28.2010 Ken Salazar announced his decision at a joint Massachusetts State House news conference with Gov. Deval Patrick voting to go forward with the Nantucket , Massachusetts wind turbine project . \nThe same day of this decision more than 5000 barrels of oil had poured into the Gulf of Mexico . \n-LRB- one barrel equals 42 gallons -RRB- . \nSeveral days later the MMS was broken into several sections ! \nDo we trust our government ? \nIn retrospect should congress review the Cape Wind permit given out during the failures of MMS ? \nObama , well aware that solving this takes the cooperation of the best deep water operations engineers in the world , is wise enough to listen and stay out of the way . \nPatton described it best : `` Tell your people what you want done and then leave it to them to do it . \nThey will surprise and delight you with the ingenuity of their solutions . '' \nWe have a problem because the prior planning BP should have had to do to get their drilling permit was n't done because BP declared that the chances of a spill were `` remote '' , and the Bush administration did n't question their asertion , it just let them drill . \nNow , after the fact and on a totally pragmatic basis BP is doing the disaster planning it should have done to get the drilling permit in the first place . \nIt takes time to cobble up workable solutions to problems a mile below the surface , and the Gulf Coast is paying the price for BP 's avoiding paying for the engineering studies it did n't do before it ever contracted for the drilling ship . \nBP saved on paperwork and preplanning , and Louisiana gets to make up the savings in the ruined lives of its waterfolk . \nMore or less SOP for republicans . \nThis is Obama paying Whites back with a White Katrina . \nHe 's acting very professorial and above it all as he and Rahm watch the livelihoods and dreams of mainly white fishermen and property owners go down the drain . \nBut , they are also going to destroy the livelihoods of many minorities who rely on these middle class whites . \nThe people who are being paid back the most though are those like James Carville : White Hypocrites . \nThe Democratic Party is filled with White Hypocrites who have very liberal talking points but then go back to their cozy all white neighborhoods just like Ted `` 1965 Immigration Act '' Kennedy and Tip `` Anti-Irish Immigration '' O'Neill used to do . \nThe reality is that change comes slowly , even in the face of crisis . \nThere was no study of the environment impact of a deep water spill , there was no research into newer methods and technology for cleaning up oil spills , and there was a protocol in place to have the party responsible for the pollution be the primary responder to the spill . \nThe government is almost completely marginalized thanks to the unregulated actions of an industry that effectively owns the regulators . \nWhat transpired 8 years ago in the energy policy meetings between Vice-President Cheney and the heads of Big Oil ? \nI 'm sure that no record exists and that we will never know . \nYou have it spot on . \nBP and the industry has the brainpower all over the world to safely extract energy resources and should be in the lead to fix this mess . \nThe government would have no idea what to do , even the PHD physicist Energy Secretary -LRB- big deal -RRB- . \nThe government should protect the environment and bill BP . \nIn fact , the winning strategy should be to let the Cajuns loose and they would protect and clean up their land . \nNoone wants this to happen . \nIt 's a profound tragedy . \nRegrettably many people such as michealjwilson want to continue a narrative that is dilusional at best . \n`` Do n't blame Obama , but that damn Bush , he IS responsible ... he single handedly changed the regulations , approved permits , told BP not to worry and caused this spill '' . \nAnd that 's rational thinking ? \nObama ca n't clean it up but he as a leader , can ensure that everyone works together , sets a firm but positive tone , and ensure that resources are available . \nJust like Bush did not personally cause this , Obama ca n't personally clean it up , but his administration needs to be held accountable under the OPA 90 Act which spells out clearly what are their responsibilities . \nIt 's unfortunate that this spill has caused people to lose sight of the following ... 11 Americans died in the explosion and there are a lot of hard working Americans , your fellow citizens , who risk their lives daily in hazardous jobs and in remote parts of the world you would never even think existed , that provide you energy to make your life better . \nIt 's just not gasoline !!! It 's lubricating oils and greases for turbine wind farms , fuels and greases for planes , the space shuttle , army tanks , diapers , tires , crayons etc. . \nGet educated about how much oil improves your life . \nwhat can the federal government do ? \nOur life-giving waters can not sustain more toxic burdens or spills . \nSee the OFFICIAL MMS DOCUMENT `` Cape Wind Energy Project Final Environmental Impact Statement , Jan. 2009 US Dept. of the Interior , Minerals Management Service '' online for details of what MMS approved for the Breadbasket of Nantucket Sound . \nLet 's look at the US National Contingency Plan . \nThis makes it very clear that the Responsible Party , in this case BP , will manage the operational aspects of the spill . \nThis will be at BP 's cost . \nHowever , BP must present its response plan for approval to the Unified Command , consisting of the National On Scene Co-ordinator , a US Coast Guard Officer , -LRB- in this case Admiral Thad Allen -RRB- the EPA and the affected State -LRB- s -RRB- . \nSo , all that BP is doing has been approved by the US Government . \nAlthough BP is in control of the approved day to day response , the US Government is in overall command . \nOnly if the Unified Command feel that the Responsible Party is not carrying out its role properly , will it `` Federalise '' the spill , take over day to day control and thus be responsible for all the contracts and costs that this will entail . \nAs to the cause of the spill , let 's wait until the full enquiry has determind the causes and responsibilities before making ill informed comments . \nRegarding the daily amount being spilled it is not helpful for so called experts to pontificate on how much , when they do not have access to the facts . \nAs to the costs , the numbers being floated are wild speculation , with little foundation in fact . \nReporters and commentators would be well advised to stick to the known facts , question more closely the veracity of the information coming from so-called `` experts '' and thus minimize the wild speculation , which only serves to exacerbate the understandable anger and frustration of the US people . \nAt the height of the mission 's initial response to the Haitian earthquake , more than 20,000 U.S. troops , 20 ships and 130 aircraft were in Haiti to assist that country 's rebuilding and relief efforts . \nMr Obama did n't need personal experience as a development engineer or relief worker to order the U.S. military to Haiti . \nYet he is incapable of ordering emergency and relief efforts in the Gulf of Mexico ? \nIs U.S. aid for redevelopment only for Afghanistan ? \nWhy is American `` soft power '' to be used only for the benefit of foreign nations ? \nGiven the former vice presidents affinity for undisclosed locations , we should stuff him in the blow out preventer and not tell anyone where he is . \nBring food and water ... erect temporary housing ... provide medical aid ... provide security . \nWhether it 's a tornado in Kansas or an earthquake in Sumatra , the basic steps are the same ... it 's usually a question of scale . \nIn this case , the challenges are different . \nBP , or more generally , the oil industry , has to take the technical lead on stopping the leak . \nWhat could the feds do ? \nThey could have requested or organized resources from the other oil companies to bring their best people in to help . \nBut in this country , the government is not in the oil business , unlike many other countries around the world . \nFor the containment and clean-up , I think the feds are a fairer target . \nYou have to have a more effective plan . \nThat is a public safety issue . \nBut that also means more government regulation . \nSo I hope when new regulations and requirements are put into place , we do n't hear the limited government people screaming about the feds ' intrusions on their `` rights '' . \nBHO makes Jimmy Carter look COMPETENT & Richard Nixon look HONEST ! \njust SEEING\\/HEARING him makes me GAG ! \nOMG , is he finding out he 's not the Second Coming after all ? \nWhat will a smattering of humility do to his overinflated ego ? \nI think it 's funny indeed , this mouth had so much to say about his predecessor 's ineptitude in all matters , and now it 's become absolutely clear even to the koolaid crowd that Stinky\\/BO ca n't manage his way out of a paper bag , and is a dishonest sleazebag global sycophant to boot . \nIt 's Day 37 of the Spill . \nObama still has n't declared it a national Emergency ! \nHe still hasnt ' given Lousiana the VERY SPECIFIC help their Governor is asking for . \nAnd Obama is to blame . \nhe 's the commander in chief . \nHe can mobilize resources in a way no one else can . \nbut he has n't done it . \nEspecially in comparison to the way Bush was skewered over his handling of Katrina -- which in retrospect was really a total failure of the state and city governments to : -LRB- a -RRB- implement their disaster plans already in place and -LRB- b -RRB- fix the levees prior to katrina . \nLousiana had klnown the levees were not sufficient but they squandered 10 's of millions of dollars over 2 decades earmarked to fix the levees . \nI am not defending the inadequacy of the Federal repsonse in those 4 days -LRB- that 's right only 4 days -RRB- following Katrina . \nIt was a mess . \nBut now we have Obama who has wasted 37 days !!! and counting without any coherent federal response . \n37 Days !!!! and now the entire Gulf ecosystem being destroyed before our eyes . \nAnd all Obama has done is pass the buck , go to fundraisers , and blame bush . \nREST GRANT THEM O LORD , AND LET PERPETUAL LIGHT SHINE UPON The Commander in Chief , who is not a veteran , will not be attending services at Arlington this Memorial Day . \nHe is otherwise engaged . \nIn the 2 year campaign to become president , Obama bashed the Bush administration for it 's inability to manage a crises . \nNow that he is in charge he is learning first hand that the Federal government is largely inable to handle any crises . \nNo matter who is the president , government has become far too large and ineffecient to be `` managed '' . \nObama was either naive or lying when he blamed everything from Katrina to the financial meltdown on Bush . \nI contend that he was just lying . \nHe was fully aware that government was broken . \nNow his chickens are coming home to roost . \nLet 's see if he can handle the criticism with the grace of his predecessor . \nI suspect we will see armies of Obama-ites on the news shows pointing fingers at others as the only crises they are trained to handle are those of political perceptions . \nAlready you have seen leftie bloggers and radio\\/TV hosts blaming the oil spill on , who else , Bush . \nBecause like everyone else he 's BOUGHT . \nReal leadership would 've seized the situation , as well as BP , and taken command of the situation rather than let our oceans be fouled and habitat destroyed . \nThe scope of the amoral , unconscionable greed will come into full light once we ALL feel the catastrophic effects this will bring about to our planet . \nWe wo n't have to wait long . \nAfter all , small-government libertarians and republicans want the government out of our lives , eh ? \nWhy should my taxes go to clean up THEIR mess ? \nThis is n't a natural disaster , it was caused by BP , and it should be BP 's responsibility to pay for whatever damage it caused . \nWhy should Big Brother Government and my taxes pay for it ? \nLet Jindal go and tell BP to clean up their mess . \nIf they do n't , then Louisiana should sue BP for the damage it caused . \nThat 's what capitalism , the free market , and personal responsibility is all about , right ? \nAs all parties realize that the lawsuits form this incident will result in setlements in the many many billions of dollars , keeping BP in the dock is fairly important . \nIronically , this is a variation on the `` too big to fail '' fiscal problem - the only way the feds have any chance of making BP pay for the cleanup is to make sure PB can not cry that big government got in the way . \nSuch officials as Bobby Jindal should rethink their desire to have the governemnt step in - it is antithetical to his basic political philosophy . \nIf they can put those pipes in the water , underground or whereever , there should be shut-off vales every few miles . \nDid they think that the pipes are going to last forever , that they did n't need to put in shut-off valves ??? And another think , I certainly hope that they are not allowed to raise gas prices because of their errors . \nAmerican people are already paying too much for gas . \nWhen the oil companies report millions and\\/or billions in profits , it 's wrong that american people are having to pay high prices for gas . \nI can not believe for the life of me that the government has not made the oil companies reduce gas prices . \nThe oil companies could sell gas for $ 1.50 or $ 2.00 per gallon and still make millions and\\/or billions in profits . \nLooks to me like the oil companies are the ones that are gas gouging !!

{"txt": "A logo is seen at a BP fuel station in London July 27 , 2010 . \nLONDON | Wed Sep 29 , 2010 12:21 pm EDT LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - BP Plc 's incoming Chief Executive Bob Dudley has ousted the oil group 's exploration and production chief following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and promised to restructure the company to boost safety . \nEchoing a move BP made after the Texas City blast in 2005 , Dudley also said on Wednesday he was appointing a new safety guru , Mark Bly , who would ensure safe practices across the organization . \n \n`` I want to ensure that we are doing everything we can to improve safety at all levels of the organization , '' Bly said in a prepared statement . \nAndy Inglis , the head of its upstream Exploration and Production , becomes BP 's second senior executive casualty of the spill following Dudley 's replacement of Tony Hayward , who enraged U.S. public opinion during the crisis with his gaffes . \nThe blown-out well came under the remit of Inglis 's unit , and BP insiders have predicted his departure for months . \nHe will leave at the end of the year with a year 's salary of 690,000 pounds -LRB- $ 1.1 million -RRB- in lieu of notice and will retain his pension pot valued at 6 million . \nBly 's role will be stronger than previous safety chiefs , a BP spokesman said , because he will have representatives in each business unit that will have the authority to intervene if they feel practices are not meeting BP 's safety standards . \nBP said it was also reviewing its system of incentives , which critics have said encouraged managers to put profits and cost-cutting ahead of safety . \n`` We will refine the checks and balances at all levels ... I want us to sharpen our everyday attitude to operational and technical risk -- to ensure it is the norm for people on the frontline to speak up about risk and for managers to listen , '' Dudley said in an email to staff seen by Reuters . \n`` There is a pressing need to rebuild trust in BP around the world , '' Dudley added . \nNeither in the official or internal statements did Dudley admit that safety failings particular to BP played a role in the oil spill . \nInstead , he repeated BP 's position that the disaster highlighted industry shortcomings -- a line of argument which has enraged BP 's rivals , who accuse the London-based company of having a weak focus on safety and technical excellence . \nAnalysts said investors would be encouraged that Dudley appeared to be willing to take bold steps and that BP was increasing its focus on safety . \n`` It plays well to the U.S. government and to investors who worried that BP had not been as safety conscious as some of its rivals , although we have to see more detail to know how it will work , '' said Iain Armstrong , oil analyst at Brewin Dolphin . \nA blowout in April at BP 's Macondo well caused an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 men and unleashed America 's worst ever oil spill . \nFears about the final bill for the disaster , along with concerns that BP 's battered image in the United States could make it hard for the company to exploit its assets there , have wiped around $ 60 billion off the company 's stock market value . \nEurope 's second-largest oil company by market value said it was also splitting up its core upstream division into three units : exploration , project development and production , with the aim of fostering technical expertise . \nInglis said in an email to staff seen by Reuters that the change would be implemented over the next month . \nBP 's internal probe into the disaster revealed its main representative on the drilling rig , and possibly his colleagues onshore in Houston whom he may have consulted , were unable to correctly read a basic safety test , thus missing an opportunity to avoid the blast . \nBP has laid most of the blame on its contractors , but rivals said BP 's own account of the disaster showed its practices fell short of industry standards . \nDudley will expand the top management team to include Bly , the heads of the three upstream units , and a new head of strategy and integration . \nEvgeny Solovyov , oil analyst at Societe Generale , said there was a risk that the additional safety oversight and top management positions could slow down decision-making at the company . \n`` I am concerned that BP might become too bureaucratic , '' he said , though he agreed it was crucial for BP to send a message that it was taking safety more seriously if it wanted to preserve its U.S. growth hopes . \n`` BP is in image rebuilding mode , '' Solovyov said . \n-LRB- Editing by Dan Lalor , David Holmes and Will Waterman -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nA gusher blew its top for more than a year about 100 years ago in California . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "label": false, "path": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-09-29__858.rsd.txt.ll_filled"}

{"txt": "Republican senator says military mission should oust Gadhafi U.S. to hand over leadership of mission in coming days Coalition forces took out most of Libya 's air defense systems , Mullen says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.S.-led military mission in Libya has effectively imposed a no-fly zone and blasted some of Moammar Gadhafi 's ground forces outside the rebel stronghold of Benghazi , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said Sunday . \nThe coalition forces , including U.S. , British and French aircraft , have taken out most of Libya 's air defense systems and some airfields , Mullen said in interviews on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' program and other networks . \nHe is not a legitimate leader \n`` I would say the no-fly zone is effectively in place , '' Mullen told CNN , adding that the strategy now is to cut off logistical support for Gadhafi 's forces that are `` pretty spread out '' from Tripoli to Benghazi . \nMullen also said Gadhafi 's forces had shown little ability to take on the coalition firepower so far , and he made clear that the scope of the mission was limited , involving creation of the no-fly zone , stopping attacks on civilians and allowing humanitarian operations to proceed . \nHe acknowledged on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that the military mission could be completed with Gadhafi still in power . \nFighter jets hit Libyan army convoy Action taken to stop Gadhafi Obama : No ground troops in Libya `` He 's a thug , he 's a cagey guy , he 's a survivor . \nWe know that , '' Mullen said of Gadhafi on the CBS program `` Face the Nation , '' noting that the Libyan leader has access to large quantities of mustard gas that concern the United States . \n`` It 's something he could do a lot of damage with , '' Mullen said , adding that coalition forces were closely monitoring the situation and , so far , `` have n't seen him move in that direction . '' \nU.S. President Barack Obama had been under mounting pressure from Republican critics and some Democrats to take steps against Gadhafi . \nOn Sunday 's talk shows , all U.S. politicians interviewed welcomed the new military mission , but some worried it was too late or too limited to do the necessary job of taking out Gadhafi . \n`` Isolate , strangle and replace this man -- that should be our goal , '' Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told `` FOX News Sunday . '' \nIn particular , Graham took issue with Obama 's insistence on getting a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the mission as well as Arab League endorsement as a strategy to prevent accusations of a U.S. vendetta against the Islamic world . \n`` I think the president ` caveated ' this way too much , it 's almost like it 's a nuisance , '' Graham said . \n`` This is a great opportunity to replace a tyrannical dictator who is not a legitimate leader , who is an international crook . \nAnd we should seize the moment and talk about replacing him , not talking about how limited we will be . '' \nHowever , Mullen and Democrats said gaining international consensus for the mission was crucial , and Mullen made clear that the U.S. role would be limited , telling NBC that `` we 're not going to put any boots on the ground . \nThis is n't about occupation in any shape or form . '' \nDemocratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island told reporters that the best outcome `` would be for Gadhafi and his family to recognize that they are illegitimate rulers of the country and to depart the scene , allowing the United Nations , politically , to organize a popular referendum or some democratic means to establish a new government . '' \n`` If Gadhafi chooses not to go , then , I think , there will be a longer period of conflict , '' Reed said . \n`` But I just sense that given this incredible unified opposition to him , particularly the Arab League , that the signal has to be clear that his days are numbered . '' \nFor now , Mullen told CNN , `` we would like to see him withdraw his forces across the country back into garrison '' and stop attacking his people . \nWhen told that Gadhafi was claiming women and children had been killed in the coalition air strikes , Mullen said on CNN that the targets were selected carefully , adding : `` I 've seen no reports of significant civilian casualties . '' \nOn other networks , he said he was unaware of any civilian casualties so far . \nAs part of the no-fly zone , coalition combat aircraft will be patrolling over Benghazi at all times , Mullen told CNN . \nCoalition forces also are looking to jam communications of Gadhafi 's forces in what Mullen called the `` first phase of a multifaceted '' operation . \n`` While we 're leading it now , we 're looking to hand off that leadership in the next few days , '' Mullen said on NBC . \nOn the same show , Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , the chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said Britain , France and Arab nations would assume control of the mission . \nMullen said he expected Arab countries that supported the mission to begin contributing military help . \nOn Sunday , the French Defense Ministry announced that Qatar has offered to contribute four fighter planes to the coalition effort . \nHouse Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , issued a statement Sunday calling for Obama to provide more explanation on the military mission . \n`` Before any further military commitments are made , the administration must do a better job of communicating to the American people and to Congress about our mission in Libya and how it will be achieved , '' Boehner 's statement said . \nTo Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona , Obama waited too long to take action in Libya . \n`` We need now to support him and the efforts that our military are going to make , '' McCain told CNN in an interview taped Friday and broadcast Sunday . \n`` And I regret that it did n't -- we did n't act much more quickly , and we could have . '' \nMcCain , the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said if the United States had acted a few weeks ago , a no-fly zone `` would probably have been enough '' to prevent the situation in the African country from deteriorating . \nEven so , he said , time is now against Gadhafi . \n`` If he -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- does n't succeed in a relatively short period of time , he 'll be driven back and , over time , I believe , defeated , '' McCain said . \n`` I have great confidence in our capabilities that the most mightiest nation in the world is now matched up against a third-rate or fourth-rate power . '' \nAsked if the United States waited too long , Mullen answered that it was impossible to say what might have changed if there had been earlier U.S. action . \nHe emphasized the importance of gaining international consensus and assistance for the military mission launched almost exactly on the eighth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , saying : `` This was n't something the United States ginned up .

{"txt": "( CNN ) -- Two U.S. and British photojournalists killed in Libya have been shot and killed by a rocket-propelled grenade , their news agencies said Thursday . \n`` He was shot and killed by a rocket-propelled grenade , '' said Tim Hetherington . \nOscar nominee Tim Hetherington and acclaimed photojournalist Chris Hondros died Wednesday while chronicling the gritty violence in the war-torn city of Misrata in Libya , their agencies said . \nTwo other photojournalists were hurt in the incident , according to news reports . \nThe International Organization for Migration ship , called the Ionian Spirit , was greeted by a number of young Libyans and about 20 rebel fighters . \nAt the port , people carried banners reading , `` US and UK with your loss , you shared with us the price of freedom '' and `` US and UK your blood was mixed with ours in Misrata . '' \nFriends of the journalists remembered them Thursday as brave men committed to finding and exposing the truth even in dangerous conditions . \nHondros had written an e-mail Wednesday `` basically saying that everything was fine and stable and he was enjoying his assignment and getting some good photographs , '' his friend Greg Campbell , who recently traveled to Libya with Hondros , told CNN . \nGallery : Chris Hondros ' final photos Photojournalist Hetherington killed in Libya Two photojournalists killed in Misrata `` Every time you 're in an environment like that , I think in the back of your mind you 've realized that you may not come out of there , '' Campbell said . \nHe and Hondros covered conflicts in Sierra Leone , Kosovo , and Nigeria together , he said . \nHondros `` was always very , very safe . \nHe realized the risks and he tried to minimize them as much as possible . \nSo when I was traveling with Chris , we would take as many precautions as we possibly could . '' \n`` There are times , unfortunately , when you just do n't know which decision is right or wrong . \nUnfortunately , that 's what Tim and Chris found themselves in . '' \nHetherington received an Academy Award nomination this year for `` Restrepo , '' a documentary chronicling the deployment of a platoon of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan 's Korengal Valley . \nIt was co-directed by journalist Sebastian Junger . \nEmployed by Panos Pictures , Hetherington also worked with CNN in Afghanistan two years ago . \nCNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen described Hetherington as humble , modest and a gentleman skilled in the taking of gritty photos of combat . '' \n` Restrepo ' was a labor of love for Tim ; he had a great deal of empathy for the young soldiers he documented , '' Bergen wrote . \n`` The resulting film is not only the best documentary about war I have ever seen , it is simply one of the greatest of all war films , sharing the epic quality of movies like ` Apocalypse Now ' or ` Full Metal Jacket . ' \nIt is also very beautifully shot , revealing Tim 's great sense of picture composition . '' \nHetherington 's last Twitter entry appears to have been made Tuesday : `` In besieged Libyan city of Misrata . \nindiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces . \nNo sign of NATO . '' \nThe journalists were walking in the front-line area at the end of Tripoli Street on the western edge of Misrata when a rocket-propelled grenade exploded , according to a town resident who wanted to be identified only as `` Mohammed '' for safety reasons . \nThe group was traveling with rebel fighters , he said . \nVanity Fair magazine , where Hetherington , 40 , was a contributing photographer , described him as `` widely respected by his peers for his bravery and camaraderie . '' \nIts profile says he had dual U.S. and British citizenship . \nVanity Fair released a statement from Hetherington 's family . \n`` Tim was in Libya to continue his ongoing multimedia project to highlight humanitarian issues during time of war and conflict , '' it said . \n`` He will be forever missed . '' \nHondros , 41 , suffered a fatal brain injury , according to The New York Times , which had a reporter in the hospital who spoke to a colleague at a triage center . \nGetty Images , Hondros ' employer , said it was `` deeply saddened '' by his passing : `` Chris never shied away from the front line having covered the world 's major conflicts throughout his distinguished career and his work in Libya was no exception . \nWe are working to support his family and his fiancee as they receive this difficult news , and are preparing to bring Chris back to his family and friends in the United States . \nHe will be sorely missed . '' \nHondros , born in New York City to immigrant parents , won the 2005 Robert Capa Gold Medal from the Overseas Press Club of America for coverage of Iraq . \nHe was a 2004 Pulitzer Prize breaking news photography finalist for `` his powerful and courageous coverage of the bloody upheaval in Liberia . '' \nHondros ' work is featured in a multimedia exhibit slated to open May 7 in Chicago that features war images and is called Conflict Zone . \nAt a panel discussion on war reporting in 2006 put on by the International Reporting Project in Washington , Hondros -- who had been to Iraq nine times by then -- had little sympathy for journalists who complained about conditions on the ground . \n`` I can talk about how I wish it was , '' he said , `` but , to me , the most important thing is just figuring out the way to cover it , which is what war journalists do all over the world . '' \n2010 : Photographer goes inside war 2009 : Images of Liberia 's civil war He said he was disappointed to hear that news organizations were having a hard time finding volunteers to go to Baghdad . \n`` I understand it from a human level , but it 's kind of surprising to me from a personal , journalistic one , '' he said . \nGuy Martin , a British citizen working for Panos Pictures , a photo agency , suffered shrapnel wounds to the pelvis and underwent vascular surgery Wednesday night , according to The New York Times . \nMohammed said Martin was in critical but stable condition . \nPhotographer Michael Christopher Brown suffered non life-threatening shrapnel wounds to his left shoulder . \nJames Hider , Middle East correspondent for the Times of London , told CNN the four journalists were documenting fighting on Tripoli Street in Misrata . \nHider said he was at a hospital and saw Hetherington die in a triage tent . \n`` It was shocking . '' \nThe journalists , including Hetherington , had traveled Saturday by boat from Benghazi to Misrata , enjoying jokes and making sandwiches for refugees , Hider said . \nMartin and Brown remained hospitalized in Misrata , Human Rights Watch said . \nThe office of the White House press secretary expressed concern about the safety of journalists in the country . \n`` The Libyan government and all governments across the world must take steps to protect journalists doing this vital work , '' it said in a statement . \nThe office said , `` Chris 's tragic death underscores the need to protect journalists as they cover conflicts across the globe . '' \nThe Committee to Protect Journalists said four journalists have died in the Libyan conflict . \n`` Two other journalists have been killed this year in the Libyan conflict . \nAn unknown gunman killed Mohammed al-Nabbous , founder of the online Libya Al-Hurra TV , as the journalist was streaming live audio from a battle in Benghazi on March 19 . \nCameraman Ali Hassan al-Jaber was shot when his Al-Jazeera crew was ambushed near Benghazi on March 13 , '' the group said on its website . \nCPJ has documented more than 80 attacks on members of the news media since unrest erupted in Libya in February , including `` numerous injuries , 49 detentions , 11 assaults , two attacks on news facilities , the jamming of two international television transmissions , at least four instances of obstruction , the expulsion of two international journalists , and the interruption of Internet service . \nAt least six local journalists are missing amid speculation they are in the custody of security forces . \nOne international journalist and two media support workers are also unaccounted for . '' \n`` Our hearts go out to family , friends , and colleagues of Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros , whose work in some of the world 's most dangerous places has had a profound impact on how we understand and perceive war , '' said Joel Simon , CPJ executive director . \n`` Their deaths are another illustration of war 's cruelty and a reminder of how devastatingly difficult coverage of the Libyan conflict has become . '' \nAfter Hetherington 's death , Jalal al Gallal , a spokesman for the rebels , issued a statement saying , `` This is no longer the Gadhafi regime taking on Libya 's people . \nThis is Gadhafi taking on the world . \nHe has spared no one , not women , not children , not journalists . \nThis is now everybody 's war .

{"txt": "ORANGE BEACH , Ala. -- Before the BP oil spill , the Gulf Coast was a place of abundant shrimping , tourist-filled beaches and a happy if humble lifestyle . \nNow , it 's home to depression , worry and sadness for many . \nA Gallup survey released Tuesday of almost 2,600 coastal residents showed that depression cases are up more than 25 percent since an explosion killed 11 people and unleashed a three-month gusher of crude into the Gulf in April that ruined many livelihoods . \nThe conclusions were consistent with trends seen in smaller studies and witnessed by mental health workers . \nPeople just are n't as happy as they used to be despite palm trees and warm weather . \nA `` well-being index '' included in the Gallup study said many coastal residents are stressed out , worried and sad more often than people living inland , an indication that the spill 's emotional toll lingers even if most of the oil has vanished from view . \nMargaret Carruth is among those fighting to hang on . \nHer hairstyling business dried up after tourists stopped coming to the beach and locals cut back on nonessentials like haircuts . \nAll but broke and unable to afford rent , Carruth packed her belongings into her truck and a storage shed and now depends on friends for shelter . \n`` I 'm a strong person and always have been , but I 'm almost to the breaking point , '' says Carruth . \nThe Gallup survey was conducted in 25 Gulf-front counties from Texas east to Florida over eight months before and after the spill , ending Aug. 6 . \nThe , a tiny Alabama fishing community hard hit by the disaster . \nAltaPointe 's clinic is seeing twice as many new patients as in 2009 , an increase it blames on the spill \nThe study did n't conclude the additional cases were tied directly to the oil , however . \nThe survey said people along the Gulf reported feeling sad , worried and stressed after the spill , while people living inland reported less over the same period . \nAnother survey found that more than 40 percent of people in coastal Mississippi reported feeling stress after the BP geyser blew , a 15 percent increase from before . \nThe survey is part of an ongoing health index survey sponsored by Healthways , a wellness and alternative health care company based in Nashville , Tenn. . \nRespondents were randomly selected and interviewed by telephone , and the survey of coastal residents has a margin of error of 3 percentage points . \nThe oil spill followed waves of hard luck for the Gulf region , including hurricanes and recession . \nExperts say it 's impossible to determine how much of the current mental health downturn could have roots in problems other than crude washing into marshes and beaches , damaging the seafood and tourist industries . \nBut an earlier study conducted in 13 counties and parishes with a total population of 1.9 million showed that 13 percent of coastal adults from Louisiana to Florida suffered probable serious mental illnesses after the spill . \nThe level of mental illness was similar to that seen six months after Hurricane Katrina decimated the coast five years ago , and experts are n't yet seeing any improvement in mental health five months after the oil crisis began . \nBefore Katrina , a study by the National Institute of Mental Health said only 6 percent of area residents had likely mental illnesses . \n`` From the types of patients we are seeing in our emergency departments , clinics and hospitals , the problems are persisting , '' said William Pinsky of the New Orleans-based Ochsner Health System , which conducted the random telephone survey of 406 people in four states during the summer . \nSleeplessness , anxiety , depression , anger , substance abuse and domestic violence are among the most common problems reported by mental health agencies . \nBP has provided $ 52 million for mental health care in the Gulf region , with $ 15 million going to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals ; $ 12 million each to the states of Alabama and Mississippi ; $ 3 million to Florida ; and $ 10 million to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . \nEven though the oil stopped flowing in July and the BP well was finally killed this month , some officials say the toll on mental health may get worse as the financial strains of summer persist into the fall . \n`` It 's like a virus that 's spreading , '' said Tonya Fistein , one of four counselors hired by AltaPointe Health Systems specifically to help people deal emotionally with the spill in Bayou La Batre , a tiny Alabama fishing community hard hit by the disaster . \nAltaPointe 's clinic is seeing twice as many new patients as in 2009 , an increase it blames on the spill . \nIn Gulfport , Miss. , 42 percent of the patients surveyed at the Gulf Coast Mental Health Center said they were sad or depressed because of the spill . \nSteve Barrileaux , a psychologist at the Gulfport center , said some of the problems leading to mental health issues are obvious , like the loss of work by a person who rented chairs on the beach . \nOthers are more subtle . \nMany people are deeply worried about the environment , for instance , or lament the lost moments they would have spent fishing recreationally with loved ones . \nOthers are still afraid to eat seafood , even on the coast where livelihoods depend on it . \n`` What 's scary is the long-term damage that can be done , and we just do n't know about that , '' Barrileaux said . \nChanthy Prak frets constantly about how to make ends meet in the post-spill world . \nPrak worked in crab houses around Bayou La Batre before the oil hit . \nShe and her husband , another seafood worker displaced by the spill , have received only $ 5,000 in claims payments since May to support them and their seven children . \nThere 's money going out but no money coming in , '' said the Cambodia native . \nIn some areas , higher rates of mental problems appear to have little to do with the oil . \nAt Lakeview Center , which provides mental health services in Pensacola , Fla. , calls have increased to a crisis intervention line compared to 2009 , but relatively few people have mentioned the oil spill as the reason they need help , said spokeswoman Karen Smith . \nPsychologists believe the uptick is most likely linked to the recession , she said . \nMore oil came ashore just to the west of Pensacola in Baldwin County , Ala. , however , and a survey conducted for the state by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found significant mental health problems that people blamed on the spill . \nTwenty-three percent of households in the area reported having at least one person who blamed sleep troubles on the spill , and 11 percent had at least one person with appetite loss . \nPerhaps most tellingly , 32 percent reported a decrease in income linked to the oil spill , which could lead to additional strain , said Dr. Charles Woernle , the state epidemiologist with the Alabama Department of Public Health . \nOfficials along the Gulf Coast worry that many of the hardest-hit groups -- shrimpers , Asian seafood workers and low-wage tourism employees -- wo n't seek help for mental problems because of cultural taboos . \nAt AltaPointe , officials hope to use a share of the BP money to pay for additional oil-spill counselors . \nTejuania Nelson , who runs a day-care center in fishing-dependent Grand Bay , Ala. , said preschoolers whose parents were left jobless because of the spill are lashing out in unsettling ways . \n`` They 're throwing desks , kicking chairs , '' she said . \n`` It 's sad . \nWith this , people do not have hope . \nThey can not see a better time .

{"txt": "Rome captive ` says Iraq sparked plot ' Security chiefs fear new wave of assaults Huge hunt for bomb mastermind Death gangs were linked , say police One of the men accused of taking part in the failed terror attacks in London on 21 July has claimed the bomb plot was directly inspired by Britain 's involvement in the Iraq war . \nIn a remarkable insight into the motives behind the alleged would-be bombers , Hussain Osman , arrested in Rome on Friday , has revealed how the suspects watched hours of TV footage showing grief-stricken Iraqi widows and children alongside images of civilians killed in the conflict . \nHe is alleged to have told prosecutors that after watching the footage : ` There was a feeling of hatred and a conviction that it was necessary to give a signal - to do something . ' \nBut some of the Italian media reports told a conflicting story . \nSome reports quoted Osman as saying : ' I hardly know anything . \nThey only gave me a rucksack to carry on the tube in London . \nWe wanted to stage an attack , but only as a show . \nWho gave me the explosive ? \nI do n't know . \nI did n't know him . \nI do n't remember . \nWe did n't want to kill , we just wanted to scare people . ' \nMilan 's Corriere della Sera newspaper said Osman first told authorities he did not know what was in the backpack he took on the London underground , then changed his version , saying he was told the attackers were only supposed to carry out ` demonstrative ' attacks . \nBut the Rome daily Il Messaggero said the suspect told investigators : ` We were supposed to blow ourselves up . ' \nOsman allegedly said : ` More than praying we discussed work , politics , the war in Iraq ... we always had new films of the war in Iraq ... more than anything else those in which you could see Iraqi women and children who had been killed by US and UK soldiers . ' \nIf these reports turn out to be true , they will provide valuable insights into the workings of the alleged terrorist cells . \nThe revelations come as police in the UK begin hunting an al-Qaeda mastermind believed to be behind the recruitment and training of both sets of London bombers . \nThe prospect of a UK mastermind controlling the cells raises fears that other units may be active in Britain . \nDespite the arrest of all five men wanted in connection with the failed attacks , the Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , warned last night of the risk of further bomb attacks . \nAccording to the reports , Hussain claimed the men did not talk about al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden . \n` We had no contacts with the organization of bin Laden . \nWe knew it existed - we accessed its programs through the internet - but nothing directly , ' he is reported to have claimed , adding that the bombings of 7 July took them by surprise : ` We never had any contact with the Pakistanis . ' \nHowever , the bombs that devastated London that day were a signal that they could go into action . \n` Our boss taught us how to make explosives out of fertilisers , ' he is reported to have said , claiming the men put them into rucksacks and used timers . \nSecurity sources fear that at least one senior figure in the global terror organization is based in the UK . \nHe may have taken part in a whitewater rafting trip used as a bonding session for several of the suicide bombers in north Wales in early June . \nSweeping new security measures are to be introduced on Britain 's road and rail networks this week , including highway patrol officers on the M25 who will check bridges for bombs . \nSenior officers are particularly concerned there could be a third attack on Thursday , two weeks after the last attempt . \nOne officer said : ` When you look at the history of terrorist attacks and of al-Qaeda in particular , there is a pattern of repeated attacks on the same targets . \nThey hit the World Trade Centre twice . \nThey attacked the embassies in Egypt twice . \nIf anything the level of security around public transport on Thursday will be even higher than last . ' \nRather than the two cells being linked directly , investigators are now focusing on the idea that the men responsible for the 7 July bombs and those behind the failed attacks on 21 July may have been recruited and directed by the same person . \n` If you look at the structure of al-Qaeda , what you basically have is a pyramid , ' a security source told The Observer . \n` If you see the two groups of bombers as two separate teams of footsoldiers on the very bottom , then there is a possibility they are linked by the command structure in the level above . \nThis is the level we are trying to identify and track down .

{"txt": "Louisiana oil spill : toxic chemical fear over BP 's clean-up efforts Officials , scientists and fishermen warn of threat to sealife in the Gulf of Mexico Chemical dispersant spreads after being released into the Gulf of Mexico this month . \nPhotograph : Joe Raedle\\/Getty Images Scientists have raised urgent new concerns over the latest efforts to mitigate the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the oil rig explosion on BP 's Deepwater Horizon . \nLatest efforts to limit the environmental damage involve an untried deep-water technique , using a toxic dispersant that they believe may damage ocean life . \nAdditionally , I have considered the use of this dispersant very dangerous \nOn Friday , Barack Obama appeared to be losing his patience with oil company executives and officials who have been trading blame since the rig exploded . \n`` I will not tolerate more finger-pointing or irresponsibility , '' he said in the White House rose garden , flanked by members of his cabinet . \n`` The system failed , and it failed badly . \nAnd for that , there is enough responsibility to go around . \nAnd all parties should be willing to accept it . '' \nApproval by the US Environment Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- for the pumping of tens of thousands of litres of the chemical Corexit 9500 deep on to the seabed early yesterday comes despite warnings from Louisiana state health officials , scientists and fishermen that the technique is untested and potentially hazardous to marine life and the wider ecosystem . \nLouisiana officials claim BP and the EPA ignored their concerns about how the chemicals may harm the sea floor . \nThis round of attempts to both stop the spill and deal with the oil being spewed out follow the failure to capture the leak by the lowering of a 100-tonne metal box over the damaged seabed wellhead . \nIn the coming days BP will attempt a `` junk shot '' . \nThis involves pumping the damaged blow-out preventer lying on the ocean floor which failed during the explosion that killed 11 workers with golf balls and other material to clog it up before closing it with heavy mud . \nBut it is the use of the chemical dispersant in such depths that has become the increasing focus of concern . \nUntil now , Corexit 9500 has been approved for surface use only . \nChemical dispersants break oil into small globules , allowing it to disperse more quickly into the water or air before currents can wash it ashore . \nCorexit 9500 has been identified as a `` moderate '' human health hazard that can cause eye , skin or respiratory irritation with prolonged exposure . \nIts makers also warn that it has the tendency to `` bioconcentrate '' in the environment . \nLouisiana health and hospitals secretary Alan Levine said federal regulators have been too quick to dismiss worries about the chemicals : `` Our concerns about the use of these dispersants underwater is based on the fact that there is virtually no science that supports the use of those chemicals . \nWe 're trading off what we know is going to be environmental damage on the surface for environmental damage of a level we do n't know that is going to be under the surface . '' \nCarys Mitchelmore , an environmental chemist at the University of Maryland Centre for Environmental Science and a co-author of a 2005 US National Academies report on dispersants , told Nature : `` No one will tell you using dispersants wo n't have an effect . \nYou 're trading one species for another . \nThe long-term effects are really unknown . \nThe dispersant has inherent toxicity . \nAnd these oil droplets tend to be the same size as food particles for filter-feeding organisms . '' \n`` Dispersants are toxic to marine life , so there are trade-offs to consider , '' David Pettit of the Natural Resources Defense Council told the Washington Post last week . \n`` And just because humans ca n't see oil on the surface does n't mean it 's not still in the water column , affecting marine life from plankton to whales . '' \nAnother toxiciology expert , Dr William Sawyer , who has made a presentation to the US lawyers representing environmental and other interests after the spill has added to the concern : `` The dispersants used in the BP clean-up efforts , known as Corexit 9500 and Corexit EC9527A , are also known as deodorized kerosene , '' he told the group . \n`` With respect to marine toxicity and potential human health risks , studies of kerosene exposures strongly indicate potential health risks to volunteers , workers , sea turtles , dolphins , breathing reptiles and all species which need to surface for air exchanges , as well as birds and all other mammals . \nAdditionally , I have considered marine species which surface for atmospheric inhalation such as sea turtles , dolphins and other species which are especially vulnerable to aspiration toxicity of Corexit 9500 into the lung while surfacing . '' \nMeanwhile , concern was mounting that substantial slicks of oil might be on the point of reaching Louisiana 's fragile marshlands . \nTV footage late on Friday from a helicopter flight over Louisiana 's barrier islands showed miles of slick being washed by waves through wide passes between islands directly toward the wetlands of Terrebonne Parish .
